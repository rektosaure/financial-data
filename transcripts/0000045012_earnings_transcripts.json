If you'd like to ask a question. During this volume simply for a thoughtful but the number one on your telephone keypad to withdraw your question simply press Star one again.\n\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to David Goldman Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2025 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website. After this call.\n\nJoining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Eric Executive Vice President and CFO.\n\nSome of today's comments may include forward looking statements that reflect halliburton's views about future events.\n\nThese matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward looking statements.\n\nThese risks are discussed in halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2024.\n\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended June 32025.\n\nRecent current reports on form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nWe undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason.\n\nOur comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in our quarterly results and presentation section of our website now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nThank you David and good morning, everyone.\n\nI am pleased with Halliburton's third quarter performance.\n\nI will begin todays discussion with our highlights from this quarter.\n\nWe delivered total company revenue of $5 6 billion and adjusted operating margin of 13%.\n\nInternational revenue was $3 2 billion, a decrease of 2% year over year.\n\nNorth America revenue was $2 4 billion flat year over year.\n\nDuring the third quarter, we generated $488 million of cash flow from operations $276 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of our common stock.\n\nAnd finally, we took cost reduction actions that we expect will save approximately $100 million per quarter going forward.\n\nOkay.\n\nBefore we dive into the geographic results, let me talk about the bigger picture for oil and gas.\n\nWe share the well accepted view that oil and gas demand will continue to grow over the long term.\n\nWe also know there is a tremendous amount of investment required to maintain production at current levels, let alone to sustainably grow production.\n\nRecent estimates are that 90% of upstream spending simply offset natural declines.\n\nUnderscoring the requirement for ongoing oil and gas investment.\n\nNear term operators are navigating volatile commodity prices as OPEC, plus spare capacity returns and trade concerns persist.\n\nThe impact is most apparent in North America, where we expect customers to maintain the cautious posture they adopted in the second quarter.\n\nIn international markets activity remains broadly steady from here as we look forward to 2026.\n\nIn this environment, we took steps to address the near term conditions.\n\nFirst we improved our cost structure by right sizing, our operations and overhead, which we expect will reduce quarterly labor costs by roughly $100 million.\n\nBeginning in the fourth quarter.\n\nSecond we reset our capital expenditures target for next year and as a result, I expect capital spending in 2026 to decline by almost 30% to around $1 billion.\n\nThird we are actively managing our deployed capital and we will continue to idle relocate or retire equipment that does not meet our return thresholds.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, we took these steps while maintaining a strong focus on our technology development, our growth engines and our value proposition.\n\nI am Super confident and the Halliburton team, our ability to execute and the strength of our competitive position.\n\nNear term conditions will not change our focus on delivering value for our customers and leading financial performance for our shareholders.\n\nNow, let's turn to our geographic results.\n\nI'll start with the international markets, where Halliburton delivered quarterly revenue of $3 $2 billion roughly flat to the second quarter.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect international revenue to increase 3% to 4% on roughly flat activity levels with typical seasonal software and completion tool sales.\n\nLet me share some progress on our international growth engines, those businesses, where we expect growth outperformance by Halliburton relative to the oilfield services market.\n\nThese growth engines production services artificial lift unconventional and drilling are central to our international strategy. We made solid progress this quarter and here are a few updates.\n\nAnd production services, we won a major five year contract from Conocophillips in the North Sea.\n\nTo deliver this contract we will transform a conventional offshore service vessel into an advanced stimulation platform.\n\nwith the first deployment of okta automation to an offshore environment.\n\nThis demonstrates our leading technology and execution that maximize asset value for our customers.\n\nAnd artificial lift.\n\nOil company named Halliburton service partner of the year and awarded Halliburton, a multi year ESP contract, which further strengthens our position in Kuwait.\n\nAdditionally, in Colombia Echo patrol awarded Halliburton, ESB contracts and nine of 11 fields.\n\nAnd international lung Conventionals, we saw further adoption of our leading completions technology and set a new continuous pumping record in novato Marta.\n\nI am encouraged by our technology penetration in this market as we deliver leading performance and maximize asset value.\n\nAnd finally in drilling we introduced I cruise force in the UAE and Qatar with strong results in both markets I.\n\nHi, cruise force maximizes rate of penetration, while utilizing advanced formation evaluation tools delivering significant value for logging requirements and rig costs are high.\n\nBeyond our growth engines I am pleased with the performance of our international business, our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers continues to win work and deliver results.\n\nWe see this most clearly in deepwater during.\n\nDuring the quarter I met with customers in Latin America, and Europe to recognize the performance we've achieved through our collaborative model.\n\nTogether, we are reducing drilling times, and proving well placement and deepening our collective competitive advantage.\n\nThe strength of our value proposition and the breadth of our technology offerings underpins my confidence in our offshore position, where we have leading technologies and formation evaluation drilling automation drilling fluids, cementing well completions and intervention.\n\nOffshore is roughly half our revenue outside of North America land today, and I expect that share to grow.\n\nTo conclude my thoughts on the international market our value proposition is winning with customers. We are demonstrating differentiated performance, both on and offshore and our growth engines are delivering.\n\nI am confident in the future of our international business.\n\nNow, let's turn to North America.\n\nOur third quarter revenue of $2 4 billion was above our expectations with 5% sequential growth driven by less than anticipated completions white space and strong activity in the Gulf of America.\n\nDuring the quarter, we executed our strategy to maximize value in North America.\n\nStacked on economic Frac fleets expanded our leading automation offerings and executed cost out initiatives to reduce our operating costs and overhead.\n\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we expect greater than typical white space and seasonal activity slowdowns to result in approximately 12% to 13% lower sequential revenue.\n\nDespite softer activity in the near term technology demand remained strong across both divisions as our customers are focused on maximizing the value of their capital dollars.\n\nAnd completions Zeus is the recognized leader in technology and performance year to date, we have introduced two additional Zeus electric fleets under contract and today over half of our active North America fleet is Zeus and important milestone.\n\nWe also see strong demand for our Zeus IQ closed loop fracturing offering.\n\nWe expect meaningful growth of this service in 2025, and 2026 deepening our competitive advantage and reinforcing our leadership in fracturing technology efficiency and execution.\n\nAnd drilling services, we delivered solid sequential and year on year growth driven by I crews.\n\nIn the third quarter, we introduced the seven and 700 I cruise CX.\n\nHighly sought after hole size for the Permian basin with outstanding results.\n\nThe system completes curve and lateral sections in a single run replicating the proven success, we've achieved in other hole sizes.\n\nThis new offering broadens the cruise product portfolio and given the systems consistent performance and our advances and telemetry automation and rig integration I am confident we will see rapid adoption by our customers and continued growth in our North America drilling services business.\n\nTo close.\n\nRose.\n\nNorth America is a tough market today.\n\nWe are taking steps and executing our strategy to maximize value. This means we are prioritizing returns technology leadership and working with leading operators.\n\nI'm confident that our strategy execution, we will drive further success.\n\nNow, let me address our investment in both the grid.\n\nAs disclosed in our form 8-K filed on October 14th.\n\nowns approximately 20% of Volta grid on a fully diluted basis.\n\nWe invested early and increased our ownership over time, because distributed power is a critical enabler for electrified oilfield services and a growing opportunity set beyond the oilfield.\n\nLast week .\n\nannounced an agreement to deploy two three gigawatts of generation capacity to support Oracle's next generation artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nThis expands voltage grids contracted backlog broadens its revenue base extends a line of sight to multi year growth and validates voltage grids position as a leading provider of long term behind meter power solutions.\n\nI am also pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with both the grid to be their international partner for delivering distributed power solutions for data centers outside of North America.\n\nThrough this agreement, we will combine halliburton's global reach design manufacturing and operating capabilities with Volta grids distributed power expertise to deliver reliable power at scale.\n\nI expect this will be an important long term growth opportunity for both bolt the grid and Halliburton.\n\nLooking ahead I am excited by the opportunities for Halliburton and voltage grid.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to Eric Let me close with this.\n\nOil price volatility is likely to impact the near term macro environment, while I firmly believe a recovery in activity is inevitable the timing and shape remain uncertain.\n\nNear term, we will execute our collaborative strategy and advance our technology.\n\nWe invest in our international growth engines.\n\nMaintained cost and capital discipline, including idling equipment when returns are not economic and finally, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders.\n\nI am excited about Halliburton, our strategy, our team our customer relationships and our technology.\n\nOur portfolio is highly differentiated.\n\nWe lead in critical product lines, both on and offshore.\n\nOur value proposition is validated by the work we are doing today and the customer discussions we are having about future work.\n\nAnd finally, our leadership team is focused on executing the strategies that deliver strong financial performance.\n\nThat I will turn the call over to Eric.\n\nThank you, Jeff and good morning, our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was .\n\nAdjusted net income per diluted share was 58.\n\nLet me start with some color on the charges taken this quarter.\n\nAll the details are available in the press release, but a few items are worth highlighting.\n\nFirst to address near term market conditions, we took steps to reset our cost structure.\n\nAs a result, we recorded severance and fixed and other assets write offs of $284 million, we expect cash operational savings from the actions. We took to result in approximately $100 million in quarterly savings.\n\nSecond because of the changes to U S tax flows we recorded an additional valuation allowance expense of $125 million as a.\n\nof these changes we also expect a lower effective tax rate on our U S taxable income going forward.\n\nNow turning to operations.\n\nTotal company revenue for Q3, 2025 was five 6 billion.\n\nAn increase of 2% when compared to Q2 2025.\n\nAdjusted operating income was $748 million and adjusted operating margin was 13%.\n\nOur Q3 cash flow from operations was $488 million and free cash flow was $276 million.\n\nDuring Q3, we repurchased.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nHum.\n\nCommon stock.\n\nNow turning to the segment results beginning.\n\nBeginning with our completion and production Division revenue in Q3 was $3 2 billion, an increase of 2% when compared to Q2 2025.\n\nOperating income was $514 million flat when compared to Q2 2025, and operating income margin was 16% increased.\n\nIncreased completion tool sales and higher artificial lift activity in North America were partially offset by lower completion tool sales internationally and decreased well intervention services in the middle East.\n\nIn our drilling and evaluation Division revenue in Q3 was $2 4 billion.\n\nAn increase of 2% when compared to Q2 2025 operating.\n\nIncome was $348 million, an increase of 12% sequentially and operating income margin was 15%.\n\nThese results were primarily driven by higher project management and improved wireline activity in Latin America increased drilling services in North America, and Europe Africa, and higher software sales in Europe Africa.\n\nPartially offsetting these increases were lower activity across multiple product service lines in the middle East.\n\nNow, let's move on to geographic results.\n\nOur Q3 international revenue was flat when compared to Q2 2025.\n\nEurope Africa revenue in Q3 was $828 million flat sequentially.\n\nImproved completion tool sales in Norway.\n\nAnd increased drilling related services in Namibia, where.\n\nOffset by lower completion tool sales in the Caspian area and lower fluid services across Europe.\n\nMiddle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1 4 billion.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nSequentially, primarily driven by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia.\n\nLatin America revenue in Q3 was $996 million.\n\nA 2% increase sequentially.\n\nThis increase was primarily driven by higher project management activity across the region and increased drilling services in Argentina.\n\nIn North America, Q3 revenue was $2 4, billion% to 5% increase sequentially.\n\nThis increase was primarily driven by improved stimulation activity in U S land in Canada, and higher completion tool sales and increased wireline activity in the Gulf of America move.\n\nMoving on to other items in Q3, our corporate and other expense was $64 million we.\n\nOur Q4 corporate expenses to increase about $5 million.\n\nIn Q3, we spent $50 million on this Aps for migration, which included milestone payments and is included in our results for Q4, we expect expenses to be about $40 million.\n\nNet interest expense for the quarter was $88 million for Q4, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million.\n\nOther net expense in Q3 was $49 million, which included $23 million due to the impairment of an investment in Argentina, and a mark to market gain on the derivatives, we expect Q4 expense to be about $45 million or.\n\nOur normalized effective tax rate for Q3 was 21, 5% based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately flat.\n\nCapital expenditures for Q3 were $261 million for the full year two.\n\n2025.\n\nWe expect.\n\nExpenditures to be about 6% of revenue.\n\nIn Q3 tariffs impacted our business by $31 million.\n\nFor Q4, we currently expect a gross impact of about $60 million increasing quarter on quarter due to section 203 to tariffs. These.\n\nThese impacts are included in our guidance now let me provide you with comments on our Q4 expectations.\n\nIn our completion and production division, we expect greater than typical white space and seasonality in North America, partially offset by strong international results into fourth quarter.\n\nAs a result in our completion and production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decrease 4% to 6% and margins to be down 25% to 75 basis points.\n\nIn our drilling and evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins to increase 50 to 100 basis points I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nThanks, Eric.\n\nLet me summarize the key takeaways from today's discussion.\n\nHalliburton delivered solid Q3 results with $5 $6 billion in revenue we.\n\nWe took steps that will deliver estimated savings of $100 million per quarter reset, our 2026 capital budget and idled equipment that no longer meets our return expectations.\n\nOur international growth engines production services artificial lift unconventional and drilling are performing well.\n\nIn North America, Halliburton is executing its strategy to maximize value.\n\nZeus electric fleets now make up over half of our active fleet and I cruise CX is driving performance in key basins like the Permian reinforcing our technology differentiation.\n\nAll of this caliber.\n\nCalibers and bolter grid agreed to launch an exciting new opportunity for international growth and data centers.\n\nAnd finally, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders, maintaining costs and capital discipline and investing in differentiated technologies that drive long term performance.\n\nAnd now let's open it up for questions.\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, once again, if you would like to ask a question. Please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question Press Star one again.\n\nWe climbed the ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow up.\n\nYour first question comes from the line of Arun with Jpmorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nGood morning, Jeff and Eric.\n\nGentlemen, good morning.\n\nMorning, Joe.\n\nGentlemen, you described how your relationship with Volta grid gives you a front seat to the emerging distributed power generation market I was wondering if you could talk about.\n\nYour views on the evolution of that market over the last 369 months.\n\nAnd maybe talk a little bit about the strategic collaboration you announced last night.\n\nWhich I believe allows you to invest in project level economics internationally, but maybe you could provide a little bit more detail around that.\n\nYeah, certainly look the.\n\nDemand for power and for AI is like nothing I've ever seen in terms of demand growth and that we've watched that.\n\nAnd we also know that not only in the U S, but around the world. The rest of the World is a really big opportunity set for the same level of growth and.\n\nAs we look ahead to what we've announced with both the grid and this is where halliburton invest in project economics. So we are we are sharing the economic value of projects.\n\nTogether.\n\nAnd also it's an opportunity to.\n\nleverage what we do really well and.\n\nFrom a halliburton perspective, we've got boots on the ground in 70 countries, we've got excellent execution skills.\n\nProven manufacturing and we also have.\n\nGlobal scale industrial global scale, which I think is critical.\n\nAt the same time, both the great. It has solved for.\n\nHow to execute these projects technically and at scale.\n\nAnd we've built a strong relationship over five years is that technology is developed.\n\nWorked closely with both the grid in our own business.\n\nAnd that gives us a great deal of confidence and how they've gone about solving the technical.\n\nRequirements for data centers, and we're just super excited to be part of the.\n\nThis whole venture going forward.\n\nGreat and just maybe my follow up.\n\nNorth American revenue was up 5% sequentially a lot better than we had expected that maybe you had guided to relatively flat on a year over year basis can you talk about some of the drivers of the outperformance in North America and thoughts on what this could mean for 2026.\n\nWell look we saw less white space than we expected in Q3.\n\nObviously drove revenues.\n\nBetter than what we would have thought.\n\nAnd I think it also gets to the strength of the customers that we work with.\n\nThe solid programs that they have.\n\nAs I look towards 2026, it gives me a lot of confidence in halliburton's.\n\nPositioning in the market both.\n\nHow we execute and maybe even more importantly, the technology that we're bringing to market and as we described but couple of things.\n\nThese fleets to work and.\n\nDemand for not only the electric fleet, which is a fantastic piece of equipment, but maybe even more so Zeus IQ in terms of what that means to us.\n\nSolving for AUR.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jeff.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next.\n\nQuestion comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nHey, Jeff and team.\n\nI wanted to spend more time talking about the middle east opportunity as it relates to power it.\n\nSpecifically is that the region, you think makes us to be spending time on and talk about some of the constraints that might exist in the middle East in terms of really scaling the AI opportunity set.\n\nAnd how do you intend to Debottleneck.\n\nLook I think that.\n\nIt's the middle East and rest of World I think our initial focus middle East, we see a lot of opportunity. There obviously, that's an economy that is.\n\nDeveloping capabilities.\n\nEvery single day and they are very much focused on looking forward to investment.\n\nAnd so.\n\nYes.\n\nThe other thing is there is.\n\nSure.\n\nCertainly a lot of available energy in the Middle East and there is also a lot of capital in the middle East and so.\n\nThose things all conspire to make that very attractive.\n\nGreat and then Kevin I know, it's too early to talk about 26 at this point and we'll get more color on the fourth quarter call, but just as you look at what is still a very uncertain macro for for North America. In particular, just any early thoughts and helping us think through.\n\nThe picture for 'twenty six.\n\nBased on early Investor.\n\nEarly customer conversations.\n\nYes look it is really early customers avid produced budgets yet at this point.\n\nWe clearly are having discussions with customers.\n\nBack in say 2006 as overall.\n\nFlattish with some bright spots is how I would describe all of 26.\n\nNorth America, we did stack some fleets in the quarter.\n\nThose probably don't come back to work, but here's what's more important to think about for 2006 in my view and it's going to be looking at the Mileposts as we go through 'twenty six because I think some important things are happening now.\n\nNumber one OPEC plus barrels are getting into the market we know that.\n\nNorth America and my view is.\n\nProbably below maintenance level spend.\n\nAnd so and then Mexico stays kind of probably where it is for a little while but that decline in production. There is also meaningful so if we think about Mexico declining.\n\nNorth America likely rolling over and all of the OPEC plus spare capacity in the market.\n\nThat creates a real inflection point now when precisely that happens less clear, but oil content demand continues to grow and that gives me a lot of confidence and I think that with the OPEC barrels sort of behind us.\n\nCreates real tightness that sort of undisputable tightness in the market that.\n\nI think the snapback will be super strong for us.\n\nAlright, Alright, we'll stay tuned as we have more investor customer conversation. Thanks, Jeff.\n\nYes.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nI had a question about the margins, which are quite a bit stronger than we were expecting this quarter, you talked about taking $100 million of cost out per quarter I'm not sure that within this current quarter I'm, just kind of curious as to how much it impacted.\n\n.\n\nYes, let me give you some color Dave on the on the Q3 margin versus guidance. So.\n\nThe first thing we had about half of the beat came from reductions in labor cost that actually we realize savings earlier than expected as our operation teams moved pretty quickly to get.\n\nThings done.\n\nThen in terms of what came out of operation between as Jeff just mentioned very very low.\n\nLess white space in North America, and strong performance from the Gulf of America team and then overall just a strong international performance, primarily from our completion tool and cementing business and on the side.\n\nThe strong result came from our.\n\nProject management business in Latin America.\n\nOkay. Thank you suggest I know I'm asking a follow up question here. So welcome.\n\nPartnership here.\n\nThere is about a couple of things obviously, we know both are good it's breaking the power.\n\nMaybe if you could just started simplify for us what how is bringing to the table here.\n\nThen sort of secondarily, what first projects that we were talking about here are both agreed to send out a bit to three gigawatt project are you talking about that size or are you talking more like 100, 200 400 of that kind of range and just kind of model both Otis and there what kind of timeline are we talking here are we talking like 2028.\n\nI wonder if the supply chain tightness and how that all lines up thanks.\n\nWell, let me start with.\n\nMaybe the last question from a supply chain standpoint, both the grant is in a fantastic position from a supply chain standpoint, and comfortable with where they are from a size of the project. Yes, we're aligned with Volta Grande around projects of the size and scale that they are talking about and so I think.\n\nYes.\n\nNot going to forecast size of projects, but I feel comfortable they can be pretty big.\n\nAnd then.\n\nWhat does halliburton bring in I think Halliburton brings some very important things.\n\nParticularly I would say industrial scale and working internationally.\n\nAll seen how difficult that can be for companies as they scale internationally, we've seen a lot of them.\n\nLesson as successful as they scale and.\n\nBut it's on the ground managing projects investing in projects customer relationships. There is a long list of things that Halliburton brings to the international markets.\n\nWe are clearly can be additive and then from a bolt the grid perspective clear on what they're doing.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jeff I appreciate it.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Sarah .\n\nWith Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, good morning .\n\nGood morning, good morning.\n\nOh, Jeff maybe I'll continue with that line of questioning on the follow up front.\n\nBut we've had a little bit on the Capex side of things because this business is pretty capex intensive not something that you are not used to date there Jeff over the past, but how do you think about that how do you think you will fund that.\n\nBut the auto grade level, but how does the collaboration outside the U S right to the Middle East like you are targeting right now how does that look like from a from a funding from a capex standpoint.\n\nSo to be to be clear about how we're thinking about it is.\n\nSo our Capex budget for next year is 1 billion whatever we do around power with Walter grid into international market is not included in that $1 billion.\n\nThe overall intent is to share total project economics. So we will be funding. This on a project by project basis incrementally over the $1 billion of whatever baseline Capex, we have for our oil and gas business.\n\nOkay. Okay I got it no that's helpful hub and then one for the not the medical market right like somebody noted on the call. Our performance has been a lot better than a lot of us were thinking it seems like just correct me if I'm wrong. It seems like you are not trying to be everything to everybody youre targeting the customers.\n\nSophisticated customers that value, what we bring to the table, but just maybe talk to that a little bit how are you targeting the north American market with the aim of maximizing value like you've been trying to do it.\n\nWell look maximizing value means that we are focused on efficiency and technology and.\n\nElectric fleets bring that but we continue to invest in technology in North America, and I think that's where the.\n\nPoint of bifurcation happens and we have been.\n\nClearly targeting customers that want to use that technology, both the electric and stepping forward into the subsurface and the control of sand and a lot of the things that Zeus IQ and the many things that we built along the way allow customers to do and we continue to deepen that competitive advantage.\n\nIn terms of how we help customers solve for EUR sand control measure sand performance all of those things and the subsurface and so very deliberate.\n\nWe don't compete in the spot market, we don't want to be competing in the spot market.\n\nYes, you've seen the stack some diesel dual fuel fleets in the quarter for that very reason.\n\nYes, clearly we are not going to be everything to everyone.\n\nWe are.\n\nVery pleased with the technology performance and pleased with the uptake on the technology. So there's really not a good reason.\n\nContinue to burn up until.\n\nStill feel equipment in a market thats not making the returns we have opportunities to us and they'll fill equipment overseas, which we may do we probably will do or we just idle and wait for later when things get tighter and we put them back to work then.\n\nMakes sense makes sense, okay, yes, I've done it back and by the way as much as I like the $100 million in cost savings on the waiting for the day when activity is going up and we are adding labor cost, but then thank.\n\nThanks, a lot for the color.\n\nAlright, thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James West with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nHey, good morning, Jeff Eric.\n\nAlright, good morning, James.\n\nSo would it be.\n\nGuys have been dancing room.\n\nBoth are good relationship with your questions. So far but I was hoping to just create some clarity here.\n\nWe obviously know they have a distributed power.\n\nTechnology that is going to be extremely useful we understand the middle east as energy rich, but really outside of industrial scale is it not the relationship that you bring to the table I mean, nobody walks into the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nHey, guys can I do business.\n\nCorrect and Thats, what Ive described global industrial scale, including customer relationships market knowledge of markets history and markets in history of execution in markets.\n\nThat is well respected by.\n\nMost of the people in those markets clearly by the people in those markets customers and governments and all the rest.\n\nExactly that's what that's what that's exactly what we see.\n\nAnd then maybe on if we think about 'twenty six and I know.\n\nNorth America, we can kind of leave that for now because of the uncertainty, but it looks to me like Saudi is bottoming and it is going to recover here in the first half deepwater coming back in the second half is that consistent with what.\n\nYour customers are kind of alluding or telling you at this point.\n\nYes, I mean, our deepwater business is getting traction now and continues to strengthen as projects start and as we win projects. So thats sort of the view of that into 26 and beyond.\n\nYes.\n\nMiddle East Saudi in particular.\n\nI expect that picks up as we go into next year now I don't think that it springs back to maybe where it was but not declining as a form of improving and I think there will be some improvement on top of that as we go into 2020 middle of 2026, and so yeah look the international business looks solid our technical position.\n\nInternationally looks very solid in terms of the growth engines I described the contract wins, we're having and really our value proposition is just continues to.\n\nGain traction with customers all around the world, So very happy with that.\n\nGot it great. Thanks, Jeff.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dawn Becker with capital one. Please go ahead.\n\nGood Segway, Jeff you've been highlighting the growth engines earlier. This year you talked about those engines could add two and a half maybe $3 billion of annual revenue three to five years.\n\nHow do you think progressing relative to those targets and I assume you feel pretty comfortable that halliburton should be growing outgrowing the industry internationally given those growth engines.\n\nYes. They are on track to do what we described I pointed out a few of the anecdotes around the progress, but the progress is really deep rooted in our value proposition and so these are strategic.\n\nOpportunities continue to gain traction globally, whether intervention.\n\nYou've seen the acquisition of uptime, which is playing a more and more meaningful role I know, we've just I think there was a press release, just last night or yesterday around application of that in the north sea with Aker BP, but that continues to.\n\ngained traction really in all deepwater markets I'm very excited about that.\n\nArtificial lift continues to gain traction throughout the middle East Latin America. So that's very much on track drilling technology continues to advance.\n\nNation drilling dunson, just amazing work in terms of automated drilling controlling.\n\nControlling our automating not only the rig, but the hydraulics, which is key.\n\nKey technical differentiator for Halliburton.\n\nAnd then in unconventional is continue to look.\n\napplied the technology sensory and continuous pumping and Argentina.\n\nThose are market first they're they have an impact.\n\nA positive impact for customers and for Halliburton.\n\nThe middle East the same way and we see a lot of opportunity, even Australia, where we've done quite a bit of work in international unconventional so.\n\nVery much on track and Super excited about the differential growth opportunity that Halliburton has in these areas.\n\nWell, it's definitely sounds encouraging wanted to touch base on Brazil, specifically Halliburton recently received a completion and stimulation contract.\n\nI expected to start next year, we've been hearing some of the offshore drilling contractors have been having one on one discussions with Petrobras about reducing costs.\n\nWhat's your outlook for Brazil, and Halliburton was approached about helping to reduce costs.\n\nLook we're super positive about Brazil, we've got a strong position there both with IOC work and with Petrobras.\n\nAgain continue to develop technology specific for that market, where in all sorts of discussions with .\n\nLook no in terms of the market in Brazil, we see growth and execution and technology uptake given the complexity of that deepwater market.\n\nGot it thank you Jeff.\n\nOkay.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nYes, good morning.\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nGood morning.\n\nYou guys have taken a very disciplined approach with respect to idling Frac crews, where you will make a reasonable return.\n\nCurious.\n\nWhere do you stand in that process.\n\nMore weighted to or or with idling be more weighted to with customers slow down I'm, just trying to think through where your market comments on North America being down 12, 13% and trying to separate.\n\nYour line market from from the idling trend.\n\nLook I think that we will.\n\nSome crews probably later in the quarter.\n\nMay see some of that in Q4, I think the the idling and the white space in some respects go together however.\n\nYes.\n\nThose crews that have been retired or not retired but idle will stay idle until we see margins snapped back on them.\n\nBut I think whats.\n\nAnd as we look at the.\n\nThe mile posts that I described is that the first thing.\n\nSnapped back or recover will be North America, and it's been that way for a decade and a half.\n\nAnd we've seen that through several downturns.\n\nAnd so we fully expect that the recovery will come quickly in North America. When it comes and we're going to want those fleets available to fill in gaps and actually take on some bigger work.\n\nSo I appreciate the color.\n\nAnd then turning to the Capex budget for next year.\n\nThe $1 billion, it's a bit below where expectations were.\n\nLet's say part of your Frac maintenance Capex should be coming down a lot with the idling and investment needs. Greg can you discuss kind of within the budget your ability to continue to make the strategic investments the toolkit and your growth verticals within CMP. It seems like those investments.\n\nThe board a lot of fruit here in terms of share gains.\n\nTo talk through the moving pieces in the budget next year.\n\nYour ability to still make those strategic investments.\n\nLook let me start with the capital budget, the 30% reduction is still in line I think largely.\n\nBut it's.\n\nLook.\n\nAnd as you described investment cycles.\n\nWe just view it as we know and that's where we need to be from a strategic perspective, we continue to invest in R&D. We continue to invest in the technology. That's differentiating we have quite a bit of that but we also have the ability to manage that inside of the budget that we have and I think then driving some tightness and equipment is.\n\nGood thing and I expect that.\n\n.\n\nYes, Youll continue to see Halliburton investing in the technology that makes the outsized market returns.\n\nI guess another way to phrase. It is do you think you can still deliver the fair share gains indeed.\n\nIndiana.\n\nWith the $1 billion budgets next year.\n\nUnequivocally yes.\n\nAlright I appreciate it thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nI wanted to pivot back to some some stuff on Volta.\n\nThe.\n\nThat was announced last night. This international collaboration is that an exclusive arrangement, where halliburton is sort of exclusively.\n\nDeploying the Volta.\n\nTechnology or can they go work with someone else if they choose to.\n\nWell look it's exclusive in parts and.\n\nAnd I think where we're targeted its exclusive with certainty over a pretty good period of time.\n\nI'm not going to get into all the mechanics of the agreement, but the relationship is such that I feel confident that.\n\nWe are the partner and I've said co investing in and the work that we've done to get to where we are has all been important work and so quite confident and where that goes and so what I think of the .\n\nMore important takeaway is as this is a fantastic growth opportunity for Halliburton and for both the grid.\n\nInternationally.\n\nIndeed, Jeff. Thank you for that and if there is some dollar of spend that needs to occur in 2026 on top of the $1 billion Capex that you have related to this.\n\nIs there a certain percentage that halliburton would be obligated to is it a 50% obligation or anything like that you can help us. So if we see a press release from Walter that Theyre spending a $1 billion and we can sort of get a sense of what that might mean for for halliburton's requirement.\n\nLook I think we will be investing and we will be investing alongside them I think the capital.\n\nWe know how to raise capital and we know how to get capital I think that these projects are.\n\nImminently capitalized and so I don't see that as any kind of impediment whatsoever, and if youll see them announcing capital investment around the world we're likely.\n\nMore than likely we are part of that.\n\nOkay. Thank you so much Jeff I'll turn it back.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Derek with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nHey, Good morning, just wanted to go back to the theme around idling equipment. If we can get a little bit more color maybe help us understand how many fleets that you've idled. How many you expect to be permanently impaired. How many you think might go back to work just trying to get a sense of the total market idling equipment, we've heard that from one of your peers last week.\n\nAnd how significant could this accelerated attrition really be for the market and create a better setup from a supply and demand perspective for 2026.\n\nWell, let me.\n\nYes.\n\nWere going to idle things that arent economic and Thats really the way we approach it is not so much a number of things.\n\nOne way I think about attrition and I think this is what we're really seeing in the marketplace. We in fact are idling things and they remain idle theyre not being bled back into the fleet to help shore up underperforming assets elsewhere for customers and I think that is really the key.\n\nWhen we think about attrition. So if we just look at amount of horsepower on the final Frac. For example, we're fairly disciplined about that quantity, we probably won't have more than 65000 horsepower on a location like that if we got to look at competitors performing.\n\nSimultaneously that number could be 100, 120000 horsepower effectively saying that.\n\nAnd thats attrition in motion.\n\nThank for the market it doesn't need to recover much if any before we'll see.\n\nReal tightness in pricing in North America.\n\nGot it that's helpful and this one might be for Eric but I just wanted to ask about the free cash flow during the quarter is a little bit light versus expectations working capital headwind, how should that flip to a tailwind in the fourth quarter and then maybe some early indications around 2026 free cash flow expectations, just given where capex is going down to $1 billion.\n\nRight so.\n\nAs it relates to 2025, Derek we're still shooting for about $1 7 billion for the year Q3 was indeed a bit low.\n\nWe are then expected that came from higher revenue slightly lower collection than expected and then the.\n\nCash part of the charge that we took.\n\nConfident about there you're already number as Q4 is always the strongest quarter for collections. So we're not expecting that to change this year.\n\nAs it relates to cash flow for 2026. It is really early to say the big focus right now is obviously on ensuring and focusing on the strength of operation returns et cetera, but.\n\nBut I would say it is the cost reductions that we've undertaken.\n\nThe thing is being equal.\n\nResult in 400 million less cost, we have 400 million lower capex. So in a way it's.\n\n$800 million resolve additional liquidity as we get into 2026.\n\nThat being said.\n\nAs we talked about the macro environment.\n\nFairly volatile so as we think about 2026.\n\nWe may we may take a bit more of a conservative approach as to how we utilize the.\n\nThe cash flow, particularly as it relates to do buybacks.\n\nGot it Okay makes sense I appreciate the color I'll turn it back.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nThanks, Good morning, everybody.\n\nGood morning.\n\nI think two things from me.\n\nOne is just to kind of get your views as we sort of think about 'twenty six a little bit.\n\nWe're hearing that frac activity is below levels to sustain U S production and I'm, just curious kind of your conversations and what you've heard how do you think the e&ps react to that as you go through 2026.\n\nLook I think that .\n\nis going to do what they need to do I am stepping back and taking a broad view and there are .\n\nSome that are slowing down and some that are maybe are speeding up but I think that overall.\n\nBased on our view North America, and I don't think that I'm. The only one that thanks. This is the fact that North America is flattish to down a little bit next year, just based on activity level and capital spend.\n\nAnd so I think every customer is going to do what they think they need to do.\n\nBut I would say conserving capital is one of the things that they're doing.\n\nThanks.\n\nThe other question I had is as it pertains to some of the growth areas, you've talked about like lift and chemicals.\n\nHow do you think.\n\nCompetitive landscape has changed and do you think that AIDS and your ability to continue to gain share in those areas.\n\nI do I think that pretty well.\n\nAnd the lift area.\n\nCertainly does and I think as both performance and technology, we've got.\n\nis a key part of the software nai around pumping our pumps artificial lift today are differentiating and we continue to grow.\n\nSo that business and if youll recall, we didn't have any international footprint to speak of what had none when we acquired summit and so what we're saying is outsized growth certainly for Halliburton and I think esp's broadly become a more important tool as.\n\nAs operators and governments and others seek to produce more oil from existing assets.\n\nSecular growth is in front of ESP and I think our unique position, both technically and from where we started at Halliburton, an outsized opportunity for growth.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Thanks for the color.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Mackey with RBC capital markets. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions just wanted to start out on the Capex Guide for next year I appreciate the incremental color on on free cash flow, but when it comes to Capex.\n\nYou've always messaged that we should think about it as a 5% to 6% of revenue type target.\n\nIs that still the case for for next year or have things changed just given given the market outlook.\n\nNo I think you should take the $1 billion guidance as a dollar number versus a ratio to revenue and as Jeff gave some color.\n\nWe've invested a lot in a couple of really key strategic initiatives around.\n\nPre crack around the revamping of our technology for directional drilling we continue to invest in these but the rollout as progress significantly. So we don't need to use the same amount of capital dollars.\n\nIn these two strategic initiatives. So you should be viewing this as being disciplined around our capital spend but making sure that we can still deliver on growth and on all of our strategic initiatives.\n\nGot it appreciate the color.\n\nAnd just stepping back to the market, Jeff You mentioned North America generally the first place to come back in as the cycle turns upward can you just talk talk to us how youre thinking a little bit more about how the drilling versus completion of that potential upswing might play out and there was some cycles, it's been drilling .\n\nThen completion or vice versa, how do you see this one playing out.\n\nLook I think the supply chain in North America is much better wired together than it's ever been so.\n\nThe idea that it's all drilling and then their ducks, and then Theres fracking I think operators and service companies.\n\nSaul for how to execute more efficiently and so I think what you would see us rig count and Frac count coming back generally together.\n\nSo and the timing of that again less clear.\n\nGot it I appreciate the comments thank you.\n\nThank you and at this time that is all that we have for questions I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO for closing remarks.\n\nOkay. Thank you John and before we wrap up today's call. Let me leave you with a few thoughts.\n\nI am excited about what's ahead for Halliburton, we have the right strategy team customer relationships technology and exciting new opportunity.\n\nYour proposition is validated by the work we're doing today and customer discussions we're having about future work. We are focused on executing the strategies that deliver strong financial performance.\n\nLook forward to speaking with you next quarter.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call, we would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines have a pleasant day."

Welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2025 Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Coleman. Sir, please begin.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Second Quarter 2025 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for 7 days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nSome of today's comments may include forward-looking statements that reflect Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nOur comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I will open today's call with a discussion of the oilfield services market, which appears very different today than it did only 90 days ago.\nIn the second quarter, Commodity markets were volatile, driven by trade and tariff uncertainty, geopolitical unrest and the accelerated return of OPEC+ production cuts. Against this backdrop, here's what I observe in the market today, which directly influences my outlook.\nIn North America, multiple operators, even large and established customers, are now planning meaningful schedule gaps in the second half of 2025. In international markets, particularly among some large NOCs, we continue to see reductions in activity and lower discretionary spend, typical of much lower commodity price environments. And finally, we've seen several well-publicized reorganizations and cost reduction efforts by large independent operators and IOCs.\nTo put it plainly, what I see tells me the oilfield services market will be softer than I previously expected over the short to medium term. We will, of course, take action to address this near-term softness. That said, I believe the demand fundamentals remain strong for both oil and gas. I expect conditions will improve as additional OPEC+ production is absorbed by the market, and operators around the world work to replace declining production and meet increasing demand. As I look ahead, I believe that Halliburton is well aligned with the themes that I expect will define the next several years.\nFirst, unconventionals will continue to be a critical component of the supply picture. I expect that advanced technology to maximize recovery and returns will expand both in the United States and around the world.\nSecond, production-related services like intervention and stimulation along with artificial lift will grow alongside increased global production of both oil and gas.\nThird, I expect demand will rise for complex drilling and well construction services to access available resources. This requires advanced tools and automation technologies for efficient development and delivery.\nI believe our strategic alignment with these themes positions Halliburton to deliver industry-leading returns. I fully expect that the strategic execution that delivered performance in recent markets will continue to deliver outperformance in the future. Now let's move on to our geographic results.\nI'll start with the international markets, where Halliburton delivered quarterly revenue of $3.3 billion. The second quarter demonstrated 2% sequential growth with activity increases in Latin America and Europe, Africa, offset by activity reduction in Saudi Arabia. As we look at the full year 2025, I expect our international revenue will contract by mid-single digits year-on-year primarily driven by activity reductions in Saudi Arabia and Mexico. Despite the ongoing softness in these large markets, I do expect Halliburton to demonstrate growth in Brazil and Norway, as well as offshore frontier basins, where we secured key wins last quarter through our technology, operational excellence and collaborative approach.\nThinking broadly about our international business going forward, our growth engines, unconventionals, drilling, production services and artificial lift remain key to our international strategy, and we believe Halliburton has unique opportunities to grow in each of these areas as evidenced by our recent progress.\nIn unconventionals, we continue to see adoption of North America style development, multi-well pads, long laterals and large completions in several international unconventional basins, which reinforces our confidence in our unique ability to lead in unconventionals. In Argentina, we achieved a record quarterly stage count and performed our first sensory fiber optic fracture monitoring service, a milestone in expanding our leading unconventional technologies outside of North America. In Australia, we recently completed a 67 stage stimulation, the largest job to date in the [ Beetaloo ] Basin. And in the Middle East, we drilled the longest well in the region's largest unconventional play.\nTurning to Drilling Services. iCruise, LOGIX Automation and the iStar platform delivered strong performance and introduced unique capabilities in several technically demanding markets. Globally, we surpassed 0.5 million feet drilled with LOGIX closed-loop automation and completed an important trial with a customer in the Middle East. In Norway, we recently utilized iCruise and LOGIX to drill the longest well in the Norwegian continental shelf to a measured depth of over 10 kilometers. In reservoir mapping, we launched EarthStar [ 3DX ]. It builds on our leading EarthStar X and Brightstar mapping technologies, and provides a 3-dimensional map ahead of the bit while drilling. This unique capability allows proactive steering around hazards and precision wellbore placement for optimum drilling efficiency and recovery.\nNext, in Production Services, we had several activity highlights during the second quarter. In Brazil, we began operations on our largest integrated well intervention contract which highlights the expansion of our collaborative model from well construction to production. In Norway, we expanded our [ riserless ] coiled tubing services beyond our initial pilot and completed a 3-well intervention campaign for a customer. Finally, in artificial lift, Halliburton secured its largest international ESP contract to date from a Middle East NOC. Middle East Asia remains our largest and fastest-growing international lift region with strong year-over-year growth also achieved in Latin America and Europe, Africa.\nWe expect International artificial lift revenue to grow over 20% this year and plan to double the installed base of [ Intelivate ], our remote operations and automation platform. It has been a strong start to the year, and I expect to exit the year with an international franchise that is larger than all of Summit at the time of acquisition, a significant milestone in our growth journey.\nTo conclude my thoughts on the international market, while activity reductions in a few large markets will likely overshadow the solid performance of other geographies, I am confident our strategy is the right one, and our growth engines remain key to that strategy.\nNow let's turn to North America, where our second quarter revenue of $2.3 billion was roughly flat to first quarter. Seasonal improvements in completions were offset by lower service pricing and reduced artificial lift activity. As we look at the remainder of the year in North America, we expect that revenue in the second half will decline due to lower drilling and completion activity. This comes in the form of more white space in our frac calendars, the full period effects of recent service pricing reductions, and the stacking of frac fleets that do not meet our returns threshold.\nWhile increases in gas activity are likely to absorb some service capacity this year, it is unlikely to offset the decreases in oil-directed activity. We now forecast full year North America revenue to decline low double digits year-over-year. In this environment, differentiation has never mattered more. Halliburton's leading technology remains an important differentiator for us. This quarter, we were pleased to see Chevron announce their ZEUS IQ closed-loop fracturing milestone in the Rockies. Customer enthusiasm is strong, and we are actively deploying ZEUS IQ across our U.S. operations. I expect up to 1/3 of our ZEUS electric fleets to operate with ZEUS IQ by year-end, a strong endorsement of a technology that debuted only a quarter ago.\nIn North America drilling, iCruise and LOGIX Automation enable our customers to maximize the value of their assets by consistently delivering curve and lateral sections on today's longer wells. This performance has driven rapid growth in our U.S. land rotary steerable business and double-digit revenue growth in North America drilling services, even amid rig count declines.\nTo finish my thoughts on North America, activity reductions will affect the oilfield services market this year. I am confident in our plans to take the necessary actions to address these headwinds. My customer conversations tell me technology and service execution are key to maximizing the value of their assets. And I believe Halliburton has unmatched capability to deliver both of these at scale, which is why I am confident we will deliver returns in North America that outpace our competitors.\nFor both the international and North America markets, here's how I plan to address the near-term softness. First, we will not work equipment where it does not earn economic returns, and this includes North America frac fleets. Second, we will reduce our variable and fixed cash costs over the quarters ahead to size our business to the market we see. And finally, we will remain focused on free cash flow and returns, and will remain diligent stewards of capital.\nBefore I turn it over to Eric, let me close with this. I am confident in Halliburton's future. Today, we are more differentiated with deeper technology advantages to address our customers' requirements and more collaborative than ever before. I believe our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is a powerful driver of both customer and shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q2 reported net income per diluted share was $0.55. Total company revenue for Q2, 2025 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 2% when compared to Q1, 2025. Operating income was $727 million, and the operating margin was 13%. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $896 million, and free cash flow was $582 million. During Q2, we repurchased approximately $250 million of our common stock.\nNow turning to the segment results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q2 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 2% when compared to Q1, 2025. Operating income was $513 million, a decrease of 3% when compared to Q1, 2025, and operating income margin was 16%.\nRevenue increased largely due to seasonal improvement in pressure pumping activity in the Western Hemisphere. The decline in operating income was primarily driven by lower pricing for stimulation services in U.S. land. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q2 was $2.3 billion, an increase of 2% when compared to Q1 2025. Operating income was $312 million, a decrease of 11% when compared to Q1, 2025 and operating income margin was 13%.\nRevenue increased due to higher drilling-related services globally. Operating income decreased due to seasonal roll-off of software sales and increased startup and mobilization costs across multiple product service lines. Now let's move on to geographic results.\nOur Q2 international revenue increased 2% sequentially. Europe-Africa revenue in Q2 was $820 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Norway. Middle East Asia revenue in Q2 was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 4% sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nLatin America revenue in Q2 was $977 million, a 9% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Brazil, and increased well intervention services in Argentina. In North America, Q2 revenue was $2.3 billion, relatively flat when compared to Q1, 2025. Slightly higher well construction activity, completion tool sales, and stimulation activity in the region were offset by lower artificial lift activity and software sales.\nMoving on to other items. In Q2, our corporate and other expense was $66 million. We expect our Q3 corporate expenses to increase by about $5 million. In Q2, we spent $32 million on [ SAPs ] for migration, which is included in our results. For Q3, we expect SAP expenses to be about flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For Q3, we expect net interest expense to be approximately flat. Other net expense for Q2 was $24 million. For Q3, we expect this expense to be about $45 million.\nOur effective tax rate for Q2 was 21.4%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Capital expenditures for Q2 were $354 million. For the full year 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be about 6% of revenue. In Q2, tariffs impacted our business by $27 million. For Q3, we currently expect a negative impact of about $35 million, or about $0.04 per share, which is included in our guidance.\nNow let me provide you with comments on our Q3 expectations. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decrease 1% to 3%, and margins to decrease 150 to 200 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to also decline 1% to 3%, and margins to improve 125 to 175 basis points.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize the key takeaways from today's discussion. First, we are aligning our business with the current market conditions. We will reduce costs and retire, stack or reallocate underperforming assets.\nNext, internationally, we see strong performance in our growth engines unconventionals, drilling, production services and artificial lift. We secured key wins last quarter through our technology, operational excellence and collaborative approach.\nIn North America, the ZEUS platform and iCruise continue to differentiate Halliburton by delivering unique value to our customers. Combined with our ability to execute at scale they reinforce our position as the leading services company. And finally, we remain focused on returns, capital discipline and free cash flow.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

I'll begin today's discussion with our highlights from the first quarter.\nWe delivered total company revenue of $5.4 billion and adjusted operating margin of 14.5%. The International revenue was $3.2 billion, a decrease of 2% year-over-year due to lower activity in Mexico. Excluding Mexico, international revenues grew by mid-single digits. North America revenue was $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the first quarter of 2024. Finally, during the first quarter, we generated $377 million of cash flow from operations, $124 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of our common stock.\nBefore we take a closer look at our geographic results, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the macro environment for oil and gas. The last 3 weeks have been highly dynamic as the trade environment injected uncertainty in the markets raised broad economic concerns and along with faster-than-expected return of OPEC production weighed on commodity prices. These market forces impact us all, but here's what I know to be true. First, oil and gas will play a fundamental role in global economic growth and prosperity. Second, the world is consuming more oil and gas than ever before. And finally, decline curves are real and in many basins, significant and adequate supplies today do not guarantee adequate supplies tomorrow without ongoing investment.\nGiven these realities, I know that our technology will continue to transform the industry and it will unlock new sources of value for us and our customers. I know our unique collaborative approach improves outcomes and deepens customer relationships. And finally, I know that safety and service quality formed the cultural bedrock of Halliburton, and they are key differentiators to our customers. On that note, I would like to take a moment to thank the Halliburton employees for their outstanding safety and service quality performance last quarter. I firmly believe that despite recent pressures on the energy macro, Halliburton's consistent focus on technology, collaboration and service quality execution create value for our customers and drive long-term success for Halliburton under any market conditions.\nTurning to our results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton delivered solid quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion. As I look at the balance of this year, while our overall international outlook has not materially changed, it is reasonable to assume that there is more risk embedded in our outlook today than 3 months ago. As a result, year-over-year international revenue to be flat to slightly down. Our Q1 international tender activity remained strong. Halliburton won meaningful work extending through 2026 and beyond. Customers awarded Halliburton several contracts that demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and the power of our service quality execution. Shell awarded Halliburton significant scopes of work this quarter, including development and intervention work for Gato do Mato in Brazil and exploration work in Suriname and West Africa.\nHalliburton also won additional integrated offshore exploration work with another major in Serene. These integrated offshore contracts rely on Halliburton's advanced technologies like our intelligent completions and comprehensive directional drilling technology, including the iCruise and Logix drilling automation and remote operation platform among multiple other well construction, reservoir evaluation and intervention product lines. Furthermore, I expect that projects like these awarded based on the demonstrated execution of our value proposition will be the core of how Halliburton wins integrated work with customers.\nOur value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, resonates with customers and is directly tied to our company culture. It is core to our competitive advantage, and I am pleased it is winning in the marketplace. In addition to these offshore examples, our international growth engines also delivered in Q1. Over the next several years, we expect these engines, unconventional artificial lift intervention and directional drilling to grow faster than other parts of our business.\nTo give you a few examples of our progress in these areas, in unconventionals, we mobilized Zeus equipment to the Middle East and expect trials in the near term. In artificial lift, we were direct awarded new offshore work in Ghana, and we expect strong double-digit international growth in this product line in 2025. In intervention, we closed the acquisition of Optim Subsea a technology we expect will transform deepwater interventions. And finally, in directional drilling with our partners we delivered a first closed-loop automated drilling system and drilled a well with it in Norway. Then we did it again in the Middle East.\nTo summarize international markets, we had a solid start in 2025. Our first quarter contract awards add visibility and give me confidence for this year and beyond. Our growth engines are strong. In my discussions with customers, tell me we are focused on the right things: collaboration, execution and technology, and I am confident in the future of our international business. Turning to North America. Our first quarter revenue increased 1% sequentially. Seasonal increases in frac activity were offset by seasonal declines in Gulf of America completion tool sales.\nLooking forward, many of our customers are in the midst of evaluating their activity scenarios and plans for 2025. Activity reductions could mean higher than normal white space for committed fleets and in some cases, the retirement or export of fleets to international markets. Nevertheless, I expect Halliburton to outperform the North America services market, and I believe this because our clear strategy to maximize value in North America has demonstrated success under a variety of market conditions. Our Zeus fleets, which represent more than 40% of our overall frac fleet operate under term contracts.\nAnd finally, our technology is highly differentiated and drives value for our customers. Halliburton's recognized leadership was on display recently when in partnership with our customer Range Resources and others, we were honored to host Secretary of the Interior Doug Bergum, on a field visit in Pennsylvania. The visit featured our Zeus electric frac equipment which we proudly built in [ Dunkin ], Oklahoma and demonstrated the industry's ability to deliver reliable and affordable energy in the United States and around the world. We were pleased to host Secretary Bergum, and I was energized by his vision and support for advancing American Energy.\nI am also excited by the adoption of our latest technologies which are a cornerstone of our strategy to maximize value in North America. In the first quarter, we achieved a significant milestone with the successful completion of the first closed-loop autonomous fracturing operation in the world. To put it plainly, closed loop means that the Zeus platform utilizes real-time feedback from the reservoir that directs pump activity to control where water and sand are placed, all without human intervention, effectively reading and responding to the reservoir. I expect that this technology known as [ Zeus IQ ] will change the game in unconventionals.\nI believe Zeus IQ provides customers both the measurements and controls critical to their journey to improve productivity and production per lateral foot. I am excited about the future of this technology, and we have several other deployments now underway. I would like to thank our Zeus IQ customers for sharing our vision and bringing this technology to the forefront. We look forward to our continued collaboration to improve asset performance with this unique technology.\nTo finish my thoughts on North America, our strategy to maximize value is unchanged. This strategy means we focus on returns, not share. Our plan is to retire or reallocate equipment rather than operate it on economic levels. We focus on safety, service quality and efficiency. We maintain equipment and invest in training. I am confident that our customers value our execution, and it differentiates Halliburton in this market. We lead technology innovation in North America, which means we develop technologies that maximize the value of our customers' assets and deploy them at scale.\nBefore I turn the call over to Eric, let me close with this. I am confident in our strategy to maximize value in North America, drive our growth engines internationally and deliver technology that creates value for our customers and Halliburton. I expect Halliburton generates solid free cash flow in 2025 and we are on pace to return at least $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.24. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.60. Total company revenue for Q1 2025 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 7% when compared to Q1 2024. Adjusted operating income was $787 million and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%. During the quarter, we recognized a pretax charge of $356 million as a result of severance costs, impairment of assets held for sale and real estate and other items primarily related to legacy environmental reserves. We expect our cost rationalization efforts to be supportive of our margins going forward.\nNow turning to the segment results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q1 was $3.1 billion, a decrease of 8% when compared to Q1 2024. We Operating income was $531 million, a decrease of 23% when compared to Q1 2024. And operating income margin was 17%. These results were primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping activity and lower completion tool sales in the Western Hemisphere. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 6% when compared to Q1 2024. Operating income was $352 million, a decrease of 12% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 15%. These results were primarily driven by decreased activity in Mexico and Saudi Arabia.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Europe Africa revenue in Q1 was $775 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and higher well construction activity in Namibia. Middle East Asia revenue in Q1 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. This improvement was due to higher activity across multiple product service lines in Kuwait, and improved completion and production performance in Saudi Arabia. Latin America revenue for Q1 was $896 million, a 19% decrease year-over-year. primarily due to lower activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. In North America, Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% decrease year-over-year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower stimulation activity in U.S. land and decreased completion tool sales in the Gulf of America.\nMoving on to other items. In Q1, our corporate and other expense was $66 million. We expect our Q2 corporate expenses to be about flat. In Q1, we spent $30 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP for migration, which is included in our results. For Q2, we expect SAP expense to be about flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $86 million. For Q2, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million. Other net expense for Q1 was $39 million. For Q2, we expect this expense to increase about $5 million. Our normalized effective tax rate for Q1 was 22.1%, based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $302 million. For the full year 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be about 6% of revenue. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $124 million.\nMoving on to other items that will impact free cash flow. We're following the trade situation closely. While the situation is fluid, our initial estimates are for an impact of about $0.02 to $0.03 per share in the second quarter, which is included in our guidance. we will provide an estimate of the full year impact next quarter. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for Q2. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to remain approximately flat. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points, primarily due to the seasonal roll-off of software sales and higher mobilization expenses related to contract start-ups.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. While there is more uncertainty in the market than there was 3 months ago, Halliburton's consistent execution of our strategy has driven results that give me confidence that Halliburton will continue to outperform. In international markets, we had a solid start in 2025 and with significant contract awards and strong delivery on our growth engines. Our value proposition resonates with customers, and I expect it to deliver further incremental wins throughout the year.\nIn North America, we have expanded our technology leadership with the Zeus IQ closed-loop autonomous frac system. I am confident our unique technologies and high percentage of contracted fleets will drive our outperformance in the North America market. Finally, I firmly believe Halliburton's consistent focus on technology development, collaboration and service quality execution will create value for our customers and drive long-term success for Halliburton and our shareholders through any market.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to the Q4 2024 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for 7 days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nSome of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nOur comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included on our fourth quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a solid year for Halliburton. Here are the full year highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $22.9 billion. Our international business grew for the fourth year in a row with 6% year-over-year revenue growth, like Middle East/Asia, which delivered an increase of 8%. Our North America business declined 8% year-over-year but outperformed the rig count and completion activity.\nHalliburton generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations and $2.6 billion of free cash flow. Finally, we repurchased $1 billion of our common stock and paid $600 million of dividends to our shareholders, representing a 60% return of free cash flow.\nBefore we move on, I would like to thank our employees for their extraordinary work this year, delivering record performance in both safety and service quality. You, our employees, are the ones that deliver our value proposition every day to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Thank you for your commitment and hard work.\nLet me begin with my outlook for the industry and for Halliburton. I expect energy will continue to play a critical role in economic growth and prosperity, and per capita energy consumption to grow for decades to come. We see this trend today as oil and gas consumption reached record highs alongside growth in renewable energy. I believe the accessibility, affordability and dependability of oil and gas are simply too compelling to ignore.\nI'm confident that as we move forward, the attitudes and approaches to hydrocarbon development will be pragmatic rather than idealistic. I believe there is no way we meet the energy demands around the world without oil and gas in large quantities for a long time, and that gives me great confidence.\nThis is a great environment for Halliburton, and we begin the second half of this decade in a strong position with a transformed balance sheet, leading returns and strong free cash flow. In the years ahead, I am confident Halliburton will strengthen its competitive advantage and financial position for 3 fundamental reasons.\nFirst, the depth of our technology portfolio, combined with our global reach, make Halliburton a leader in the global services marketplace. We focus our investments in market segments where our unique strengths generate attractive returns, and I expect our targeted technology developments in electrification, automation and digital solutions to further increase these advantages.\nSecond, our unique value proposition aligns Halliburton with our customers to deliver leading results and maximize asset values. We see the value of this alignment demonstrated again and again in the deepening of our customer strategic alliances. Lastly, I see customer activity shifting towards drilling technology, unconventionals well intervention and artificial lift, all of which are areas where Halliburton excels today and where we are uniquely positioned to outperform in the future.\nTurning to our results. I'll begin with the international markets, where Halliburton delivered another year of profitable growth. Our full year international revenue grew 6% year-over-year led by the Middle East/Asia region, which grew 8%. I am pleased with our performance and the growth of our international business.\nIn 2025, we expect flat international revenues for Halliburton year-over-year, with growth in most international markets, offset by activity reduction in Mexico. Absent Mexico, we expect our international franchise will grow low to mid-single digits next year.\nBeyond 2025, I am confident in the long-term outlook for Halliburton, in particular, the next 5 years based on the growth engines in our international business and the power of our customer alliances. These growth engines include Halliburton's drilling technologies, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift businesses. I believe these growth engines could collectively generate an additional $2.5 billion to $3 billion of annual revenue in 3 to 5 years.\nEven more exciting than the growth I see in these areas is the trend I see of customers embracing our value proposition to work in increasingly more collaborative and innovative ways. They adopt is way of working because it has proven to consistently improve performance and create value for them. While the power of our collaborative value proposition has traction all around the world, it's most visible in Norway.\nHalliburton has a growing and profitable business in Norway built on strong customer alliances. These alliances apply leading technologies and collaborative work environments. Together with our customers, we have successfully pioneered several advances that have delivered significant improvements in performance and safety. Over time, I see the rest of our international business moving in the same direction.\nWhat is clear to me, and equally so to a growing group of operators, is that the future of performance lies in deep collaboration. For the last decade, we have made strategic choices in the development of our people, processes and technology to reinforce a culture that is highly collaborative and creates exceptional performance in these environments. I expect this change will create unique value for Halliburton and our customers.\nTo summarize international markets, I expect our value proposition and driving deep collaboration will further differentiate us and create clear value for both Halliburton and our customers. And our growth engines will contribute meaningfully to our international business in the years to come. I'm excited about these opportunities and I believe Halliburton has a terrific platform to outperform the international services market in 2025 and beyond.\nIn North America, our full year revenue of $9.6 billion was an 8% decrease from 2023. Fourth quarter 2024 revenues were 7% lower than third quarter 2024, due to seasonality and customer budget exhaustion. As we look to 2025, I expect our North America revenue to decrease low to mid-single digits from 2024 levels or approximately flat with the second half of 2024.\nThis lower revenue for the year is driven in part by lower negotiated prices for a portion of our fleet, and we expect to see the majority of the margin impact from these price revisions in our first quarter results. Despite pricing, I am confident our financial performance will widely outpace our competition.\nIf I step back from the numbers for a minute, I'm excited about several things Halliburton is doing in North America this year. Let me tell you what's going on under the hood that has me so excited. First, we are sold out. All of our fleets are working under committed or contracted programs. Next, Zeus, we're extending and renewing contracts for existing fleets, making new Zeus deliveries and expect our market-leading e-fleets will comprise 50% of our fleet by the end of 2025.\nNext, technology. Octive Auto Frac and Sensori are being widely adopted by customers and delivering value. Next, directional drilling. iCruise rotary steerables are on a pace to capture about 30% of the North America rotary steerable business by year-end. And finally, I believe the next catalyzing inflection for North America services will be up, not down.\nI believe the most pressing energy problem in North America today is the power shortage driven by electrification and power demand for AI, and this cannot solve without significant amounts of natural gas. This is on top of the expected increases in LNG exports. These are all very good things for Halliburton in 2025. These are the bedrock of our North America franchise as we move into the second half of the decade.\nWhen I think about the North America market through this period, several themes are crystal clear to me. First, our customers rely on our technology, innovation and collaborative work processes to deliver leading performance and lower total well costs. I expect further adoption of these technologies as our customers fully integrate them into their workflows, where they drive stable, long-term work programs for Halliburton.\nOctive Auto Frac is a great example of this. Launched last year, it is already used on over 50% of our Zeus spreads with more growth expected this quarter. Our Sensori fracture monitoring is another example. Customers are adopting this technology at scale to optimize well completion designs on multi-well pads. In the fourth quarter alone, Sensori was used on more than 2,500 frac stages in North America.\nThe second trend that I expect to continue is the rising importance of North America in our large customers' development plans and budgets. I expect our large customers will continue the industrialization of unconventional resources and seek even greater efficiencies and productivity. I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to innovate and deliver these improvements at scale.\nA final trend I expect to see through the rest of the decade is the durability and strength of Halliburton's financial performance. I believe there is little out that our margins and cash flow generation to date have marked a step change from prior cycles. While markets and margins will fluctuate, I am confident Halliburton's strategy will deliver attractive financial results over the long term.\nLet me close my remarks with this. I'm excited about both the year ahead and the long term for Halliburton. We expect to execute our value proposition, deepen our technology portfolio and deliver incremental revenue through our growth engines, drilling technology, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift.\nFinally, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation, prioritizing cash flow and return of free cash flow to shareholders. In 2024, we returned $1.6 billion or about 60% of free cash flow to shareholders in stock repurchases and dividends, and I expect we will return at least $1.6 billion of cash in 2025.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.70. Total company revenue for Q4 '24, was $5.6 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Operating income was $932 million and operating margin was 17%.\nNow turning to the segment's results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q4 was $3.2 billion, a decrease of 4% sequentially. Operating income was $629 million, a decrease of 6% sequentially. Operating margin was 20%, a sequential decrease of 49 basis points. Revenues were primarily driven by lower stimulation activity in North America and decreased pressure pumping services in Latin America. Partially offsetting these decreases were improved artificial lift activity in North America and increased stimulation activity in Africa and the Middle East.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion and operating income was $401 million, both flat sequentially. Operating margin was 16%, a sequential decrease of 44 basis points. Revenues were driven by increased fluid services in the Middle East and Europe/Africa and improved drilling-related services in the North Sea, offset by decreased drilling services in the Middle East and Latin America.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q4 was $953 million, a decrease of 9% sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity across multiple product lines in Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher activity across multiple product lines in Brazil.\nEurope/Africa revenue in Q4 was $795 million, an increase of 10% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to improved drilling-related services in the North Sea as well as increased pressure pumping services and higher fluid services in Africa. Partially offsetting these increases were lower cementing activity and decreased pipeline services in the North Sea.\nMiddle East/Asia revenue in Q4 was $1.6 billion, an increase of [ 7% ] sequentially. This increase was primarily due to higher stimulation activity, fluid services and completion tool sales in the Middle East, partially offset by decreased drilling throughout Asia.\nIn North America, Q4 revenue was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 7% sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by lower stimulation activities across the region, partially offset by higher artificial lift activity and increased completion tool sales.\nMoving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. We expect our first quarter 2025 corporate expenses to decrease slightly. In Q4, we spent $33 million or about $0.04 per diluted share on the SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q1 2025, we expect SAP expenses to be about $25 million. For the full year '25, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately $100 million.\nNet interest expense for the quarter was $84 million. For Q1 2025, we expect net interest expense to be about $90 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $47 million which was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q1 2025, we expect this expense to be approximately $40 million.\nOur effective tax rate for Q4 was 22.6%, and we expect our Q1 2025 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For the full year 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, an increase of 300 basis points over our 2024 effective tax rate. This increase is driven in equal parts by fewer anticipated discrete tax items, the implementation of Pillar 2 taxes and the shift in geographic earnings mix. Importantly, I expect full year cash taxes to be approximately flat with 2024.\nCapital expenditures for Q4 were $426 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion or about 6% of revenue. For the full year of 2025, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion driven by exceptionally strong collections during the quarter. Our free cash flow in Q4 was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to $2.6 billion, a 16% increase over 2023.\nNow let me provide you with comments on our expectations for our divisions for Q1 2025. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 3% to 5%, and margins to decline 175 to 225 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline 8% to 10% and margins to be flat to down 50 basis points.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in the long-term outlook for oil and gas, and I am pleased with the shift towards a pragmatic development of hydrocarbon resources.\nIn the international markets, we see long-term growth as a result of the broader adoption of our collaborative value proposition and our growth engines. In North America, we were sold out on our frac capacity. We see strong adoption of both our Completions and Drilling technologies, and I am confident our financial performance will widely outpace our competition.\nFinally, we had a strong year for cash returns to shareholders and expect to return at least $1.6 billion to shareholders in 2025. And now let's open it up for questions."

Halliburton delivered solid second quarter results that demonstrated the strength of our international business and the differentiation of our North America service offerings.\nHere are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion and operating margin of 18%. International revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 8% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 10% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, an 8% decrease year-over-year compared to a 12% decline in rig count over the same period. Our Drilling and Evaluation division and our Completion and Production division both demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. Finally, during the second quarter, we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and about $800 million of free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of our common stock.\nI'll begin our discussion with the international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our international business.\nAs I look ahead for the remainder of this year, my outlook today is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. I expect steady growth for Halliburton throughout the remainder of 2024. In our international markets, we see strong demand for Halliburton services, high activity levels and equipment tightness across all major basins. We expect our international business to deliver about 10% revenue growth for the full year.\nI'm pleased with the profitable growth we are seeing across our product lines and today, I would like to highlight three specific ones in more detail. The first is our Landmark software business. I recently attended our Landmark forum, Life 2024 -- Athens, Greece. It is an annual event where we share our latest software innovations and our customers share their successes and future opportunities. While in Athens, I had the opportunity to meet with dozens of customers, and they told me how excited they were about our latest offerings like unified ensemble modeling, scalable earth model and our latest developments in AI and machine learning. These tools change the way customers work by driving efficiencies from asset level planning through production.\nThe conference included customer presentations that showcase their business transformation and their use of Halliburton Landmark's tools. Our customers tell us we create unique value with our iEnergy Cloud platform, which seamlessly integrates into their workflows. I am confident that Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 will expand and add to our customers' productivity and innovation journey.\nNext, Halliburton's artificial lift product line is growing in the international markets at double the rate of our overall international business. It embodies our successful M&A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions that bring leading technology into our portfolio.\nWe organically grow new technologies through our global footprint and through collaboration with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their assets value. As one example, this quarter, we launched our GeoESP line, which is engineered for the harsh geothermal environment. The GeoESP line solves for extreme thermal cycling, scale development, abrasion and corrosion. While geothermal ESP technology has applications across the globe, Halliburton sees substantial growth opportunities in Europe where customers require advanced technology to bring geothermal to scale.\nFinally, Halliburton's drilling services are key to our success in the international markets. We had another strong quarter in unconventional drilling with our iCruise X rotary steerable system and our Logix autonomous drilling platform. We deploy advancements that improve drilling speed and reliability and set several interval records during the quarter.\nWe invest in differentiated drilling technology, and we expect our strong performance and reliable execution to drive above-market growth. For example, in the Middle East, our drilling services revenue grew about 30% year-over-year.\nI am pleased with our international business and look forward to deepening our strategy and delivering additional profitable growth.\nTurning to North America. Our second quarter revenue declined 3% compared to the first quarter. Halliburton's first half 2024 results were largely as we expected. However, as we have seen, rig counts and overall service activity declined through the quarter. As I look to the second half of 2024, I now expect full year North America revenues to decline 6% to 8% versus last year, driven by lower activity. I expect that the second half of 2024 will be near the low point of activity levels this cycle. And while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2025 in North America, I expect activity to be directionally higher than the second half of 2024.\nHere's how I think about this. First, I expect an increase in activity after E&P companies complete their acquisitions and establish new development plans. Second, some of the merged assets will be divested to smaller operators who will put them to work. Finally, I expect some recovery in natural gas activity.\nSix years ago, when we set our strategy to maximize value in North America, I understood it may take a market like we see today, where North America activity declined by over 200 rigs in the last 18 months to demonstrate the margin resilience and earnings power of our strategy. I am pleased that Halliburton delivered strong C&P margins through this period, and I am confident that our strategy will deliver strong results in the future. We're committed to our strategy to maximize value in North America because it delivers shareholder value and it is the right strategy for this market.\nFor Halliburton, we focus on returns. We allocate capital to the markets and products that drive superior returns and margins. We prioritize returns over market share. And to that end, we retired a few fleets this quarter. We developed differentiated technologies that solve for the unique requirements of the North America market. And lastly, we improve efficiencies for our customers through those technologies, service quality and execution. I expect this strategy will deliver leading performance for our customers and a structurally more resilient North America business for Halliburton.\nA key part of how we do this is our strategic investment in technology. One technology I'm excited about is the latest addition to Octiv, a key component of the [ Zoos ] platform. Today, Octiv is a cornerstone of how we deliver large multi-well pads with unmatched precision and consistency. As our customers execute completions with ever-increasing side and intensity, automation, as delivered by Octiv provides better control and more effective delivery for simul-frac and trial frac operations.\nDuring the second quarter, we completed field trials of the latest level of Octiv automation called Auto Frac. With the single click of a button, Auto frac executes the entire frac job from ramp-up at the start to ramp down at the end, making a cost fracturing a reality. This new level of automation gives customers control to execute the frac design, exactly how they want it without human intervention. Following our commercial trials, Auto Frac is ready to scale. And I'm excited about what this technology means for our customers and for Halliburton.\nLastly, we see rapid adoption in North America of our iCruise rotary steerable system. We consistently reduced drilling times for our customers and create significant value. In the Permian Basin, the number of rigs running the system has increased by almost 45% since the start of this year. We are on pace to triple our footage drilled in North America this year, and I'm excited about the market adoption of iCruise.\nNorth America is the largest oilfield services market in the world. We are crystal clear on how we maximize value in North America. We have demonstrated that this strategy works, and that's why I am confident that we will continue to deliver strong returns through this cycle.\nTo step back, Halliburton's returns and cash flows are strong, and I am pleased with our performance this quarter. I'm just back from a few weeks in Europe/Africa. What I saw is a microcosm of Halliburton around the world. The quality of our people, the clarity of our strategy, our leading technologies, the depth of our pipeline of opportunities and the competitiveness of our business segments, all give me incredible confidence in Halliburton's future.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide a few more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q2 reported net income per diluted share was $0.80. Total company revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, flat sequentially. Operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 5% and operating margin was 18%, a sequential increase of 69 basis points.\nBeginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q2 was $3.4 billion, sequentially flat. Operating income was $723 million, up 5% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 21%. These results were primarily driven by strong international completion and production performance, offsetting softer results in North America.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q2 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $403 million, both sequentially flat from Q1 2024. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 20 basis points. These results reflect the strength of our global D&E business despite the roll-off of seasonal software sales in Q2, which affected every region.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our Q2 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $757 million, an increase of 4% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by higher well construction activity and improved wireline activity in Norway, along with increased completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity in West Africa.\nMiddle East/Asia revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially. This increase was primarily related to higher activity in the Middle East across multiple product lines and higher fluid services in Asia. Latin America revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, sequentially flat.\nIn North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land and decreased completion tool sales and testing services in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMoving on to other items. In Q2, our corporate and other expense were $65 million. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to increase slightly. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q2, we spent $29 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For the third quarter, we expect SAP expenses to increase slightly.\nNet interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the third quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other net expense for Q2 was $20 million, which was lower than anticipated, driven by favorable FX movements. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million.\nOur effective tax rate for Q2 was [ 22.5% ], lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter of 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 1%.\nCapital expenditures for Q2 were $347 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of revenue.\nOur Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $793 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than in 2023.\nNow let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the third quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be down 1% to 3% and margins to decrease by 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Here are a few key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am pleased with our 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We are well on track to deliver over 10% free cash flow growth this year.\nI'm excited about our international business where our technology portfolio has never been stronger. I am confident that our strategy to maximize value in North America is working, and I expect it continues to deliver strong returns.\nFinally, I am convinced that our collaborative approach and value proposition differentiate us from our competitors and are directly aligned with how our customers expect to drive improved performance.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to Q1 2024 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Dave Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nHello and thank you for joining the Halliburton First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for 7 days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nSome of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nOur comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results that again demonstrated the power of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Here are the quarter highlights.\nWe delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion and operating margin of 17%. Both divisions demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. International revenue was $3.3 billion and grew 12% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 21% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Finally, during the first quarter, we generated $487 million of cash flow from operations, $206 million of free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of our common stock.\nLet me begin today's discussion with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. Global energy use is on the rise with crude oil demand projected to grow between 1.2 million and 2.3 million barrels per day in 2024. This demand growth is greatest in non-OECD countries, where we expect more per capita energy consumption, not less, as they develop their economies and improve their quality of life. Globally, secure, reliable hydrocarbon production powers industries, moves people and advances economies.\nIn the U.S., after stable electricity demand for nearly 2 decades, we now expect it to grow more than 15% by 2030. Today, over 40% of United States electricity is supplied by natural gas, and we expect strong demand for natural gas as a base fuel well into the future.\nThe world requires more energy, not less, and I'm more convinced than ever that oil and gas will fill a critical role in the global energy mix for decades to come. My outlook is confirmed by our customers' multiyear activity plans across multiple markets and asset types. Everything I see points towards long-term growth for Halliburton's services.\nMy outlook for the industry is not new, and it drives our focus on oilfield services and sets our strategy. This focus is the basis for our technology investment, capital allocation and culture. This multiyear upcycle, together with our successful strategy execution, make this a great time for Halliburton.\nNow let's turn to international markets where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. For 2024, I expect full year revenue growth in the low double digits. Equally important, the international market remains tight for equipment and people, and therefore, we expect to see margin expansion over last year.\nOne of the many things that excites me about our international business is our technology that creates meaningful value for our customers and drives above-market growth for Halliburton. In the Drilling and Evaluation division, our leading formation evaluation tools, such as the EarthStar X logging well drilling system and our Reservoir Xaminer formation sampling service both see strong adoption and increasing levels of demand. The advanced measurements these systems provide create unique insights for our customers and drive profitable growth for Halliburton.\nIn the Completion and Production division, our artificial lift technology continues to generate profitable growth throughout each of our international regions. Our electric submersible pump portfolio proved to be a market leader in the competitive North American market, and we expect to deliver similar results over time in the international markets.\nOur complete solution, which includes downhole motors, pumps and surface systems with remote monitoring and automation, provides an end-to-end solution and the ability to operate at scale. A great example is in Kuwait, where in less than 3 years, we captured a nearly 20% market share with over 700 ESP installs.\nBefore we move on, I want to share an observation. I'm consistently seeing more global interest in unconventionals. I can recall over a decade ago, the global scrambled to find unconventionals with limited success. Today, 2 significant markets outside of North America achieved scale, which serves as a proof point for what is possible and drives interest by others.\nAs global markets grow, the technologies and processes Halliburton developed as the leader in North America over the last 3 decades have broad applications to unconventional reservoirs throughout the world, which makes this a fantastic long-term opportunity for Halliburton. I am confident in the duration of this international upcycle in 2024 and beyond.\nTurning to North America. Our first quarter revenue grew 5% over last quarter. As expected, North America land completion activity bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year and rebounded in the first quarter as our customers quickly resumed operations after the holidays.\nLooking ahead for the rest of 2024 in North America, we expect steady activity levels for Halliburton. Our customers are planning for the long term, and I expect they will execute work throughout the year as planned. This is consistent with a more industrialized approach to asset development in North America. And while we expect an eventual recovery in natural gas activity driven by demand from LNG expansions, our 2024 plan does not anticipate this recovery. Overall, we expect that full year North America revenue and margins will be flattish compared with 2023 levels.\nClearly, our strategy is to maximize value in North America. We do it in multiple ways. Today, I want to talk about 2 of them. The first is the Zeus platform, and the second is our new North America-focused directional drilling system. The Zeus platform, its electrification, automation and subsurface diagnostics continue to advance. This quarter, we introduced Sensory, which is the latest generation of our subsurface measurement technology. Sensory provides an easy-to-deploy, cost-effective and automated system for real-time subsurface measurement of fracturing operations.\nAdditionally, our automation technologies are at the heart of our highly efficient simul-frac and trimul-frac operations, and they continue to expand their capabilities, creating value for Halliburton and our customers. The Zeus platform demonstrates its uniqueness every day. And importantly, it's deployed at scale. Our scale allows for rapid technology innovation. Each technology improvement to the Zeus platform widens the moat around our leading position in the fracturing market. This creates outsized value for Halliburton and our customers.\nI am pleased with the results we see in North America from our drilling services product line, which late last year, launched a new version of our iCruise Rotary Steerable System, specifically engineered for the North America unconventional market. The new iCruise CX system is designed for the challenging curve and lateral applications in North America. The system's performance is driving strong uptake. And this quarter, our iCruise footage drilled in North America more than doubled over last year.\nWe also coupled this high-performing system with an asset-light sales and rental model that increases the addressable market when compared to a full-service model. This is how iCruise CX both participates in new market segments and increases its speed-of-market penetration.\nThe key trend that I see in North America drilling is the move to longer laterals and more complex wells, which customers drill to improve economics. iCruise CX is specifically designed for these applications, and its performance is why I am excited about Halliburton's growth in the North America drilling market.\nTo close out, I'd like to thank our employees. I regularly hear from our customers about the work you do, how much it means to them and how your execution of our value proposition differentiates Halliburton from our competitors. Well done.\nI'm excited about the business outlook for Halliburton. Energy demand growth is strong and so is demand for our services. I expect that our focus on oilfield services and execution of our strategy will generate strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. This quarter, Halliburton repurchased $250 million of our common stock, a solid start to the year and a good benchmark for our expectations going forward.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.76. Total company revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, operating income was $987 million, and operating margin was 17%, flat compared to Q1 2023.\nBeginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in Q1 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from Q1 2023. Operating income was $688 million, up 3% when compared to Q1 2023. And operating income margin was 20%. Compared to Q1 of last year, these results were primarily driven by reduced pressure pumping services in U.S. land, partially offset by higher activity in international markets.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to Q1 2023. Operating income was $398 million, up 8%. And operating margin was 16%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q1 last year. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services in the Middle East and North America as well as improvements across multiple product lines in Latin America.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue increased 12% year-over-year. Europe/Africa revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $729 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by higher completion tool sales in the region and fluid services in Norway and the Caspian area.\nMiddle East/Asia revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.4 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. This increase was primarily related to improved activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman. Latin America revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This improvement was primarily related to higher drilling-related services and increased software sales in Mexico, improved pressure pumping service and fluid services in Argentina and increased activity in multiple product service lines in Brazil and Ecuador.\nIn North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing an 8% decrease year-over-year but a 5% increase from the last quarter. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower pressure pumping services in U.S. land as well as lower wireline activity.\nMoving on to other items. In Q1, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expense to be approximately flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q1, we spent $34 million or about $0.04 per diluted share on SAP S/4 for migration, which is included in our results. For the second quarter, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately flat.\nNet interest expense for the quarter were [ $92 ] million. For the second quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other net expense for Q1 was $108 million, higher than expected primarily due to impairment of an investment in Argentina and currency devaluation in Egypt. For the second quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate for Q1 was 21.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 75 basis points. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $330 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue.\nOur Q1 cash flow from operations was $487 million, and free cash flow was $206 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023.\nNow let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the second quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be up 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results. I am confident in the strength and duration of this upcycle. We expect our North America business to deliver flattish revenues and margins year-on-year despite lower activity levels. We also expect our international business revenue to grow at low double digits year-on-year.\nI'm excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions."

Both of our divisions achieved their highest operating margins in over a decade, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Here are the highlights.\nWe delivered full year total company revenue of $23 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year; and operating income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2022 adjusted operating income. Our international business demonstrated strong growth with our revenue up 17% year-over-year despite our exit from Russia in August of 2022, completing 2 consecutive years of high teens growth.\nOur North America business showed strength with revenue up 9% year-over-year despite rig count declines. Completion and Production revenue grew 18% year-over-year and margins expanded 312 basis points. Drilling and Evaluation grew 7% year-over-year and margins expanded 171 basis points.\nTurning now to Q4, where Halliburton delivered exceptional margin performance supported by better-than-anticipated completion tool sales globally, strong performance across multiple high-margin product lines and favorable weather in North America.\nCompletion and Production margins finished the year almost 100 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year, led by the Europe-Africa region, which grew revenue 17%. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash from operations, $1.1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of common stock and $150 million of debt.\nBefore we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success last quarter and throughout 2023 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. Thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance.\nLet me begin with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. As we look past the new cycle and near-term commodity price volatility, the fundamentals for oilfield services remain strong. Here are 2 reasons why.\nFirst, we see an increase in service intensity everywhere we operate. Whether it's longer laterals in North America, smaller and more complex reservoirs in mature fields or offshore deepwater, customers require more services to develop their resources, not fewer.\nSecond, long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands on all forms of energy. I expect oil and gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into the future. With this positive macro outlook, I believe Halliburton's strong execution, leading technology and collaborative approach will drive demand for Halliburton's products and services around the world.\nNow let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's performance delivered another year of profitable growth. Halliburton's full year international revenue grew 17% year-on-year, and our quarterly revenue grew 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. Each region delivered year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2023, and both divisions delivered improved international margins year-on-year.\nOur results in 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of Halliburton's profitable international growth strategy, the strength of our global competitiveness across product lines and the power of our value proposition with customers.\nIn 2024, we expect international E&P spending to grow at a low double-digit pace and foresee multiple years of sustained activity growth. Although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the Middle East/Asia region will likely experience the greatest increases in activity with other regions closely behind.\nAs we look out to 2025, we expect Africa and Europe, among others, to demonstrate above-average growth. Beyond 2025, we see an active tender pipeline with work scopes extending through the end of the decade, which gives me confidence in the duration of this multiyear upcycle.\nWhile we expect overall activity growth, we also see above-market growth within our well construction product lines, where customers choose Halliburton to improve the reliability, consistency and efficiency of their drilling operations. One such technology is LOGIX' autonomous drilling platform, which is now used on 90% of our iCruise runs worldwide.\nCustomers also rely on Halliburton's subsurface expertise to develop today's most complex reservoirs. This requires technologies to reduce uncertainties, such as our DecisionSpace 365, unified ensemble modeling and advanced formation evaluation systems like our iStar logging well drilling platform, and reservoir Xaminer formation testing service. These technologies enable customers to target small reservoirs, identify bypassed reserves and gather reservoir properties in real time. We see reservoir complexity increasing worldwide, and I expect the capabilities of these systems will continue to deliver customer value and lead in overall growth within our formation evaluation portfolio.\nFor Completion and Production, we also expect increased adoption of our technologies like intelligent completions, multilateral solutions and artificial lift. Our intelligent and multilateral completions enable customers to produce, inject and control multiple zones in a wellbore, which is critical for offshore developments, a segment we expect to outpace the overall market.\nIn artificial lift, our strategy targets markets like the Middle East and Latin America, where our differentiated performance and existing footprint create a solid foundation for profitable growth. We also expect strong demand for our services in carbon capture and storage, where Halliburton's leading capabilities to design, deliver and validate reliable barriers play a crucial role. As our customers invest in carbon storage, our tailored cement designs and casing equipment technology enable them to address the unique challenges of long-term carbon sequestration.\nWith this activity growth, the availability of equipment and experienced personnel remains tight. We expect asset-intensive offshore activity to increase, which will further tighten the market. As offshore represents over half of our business outside North America land, we expect this activity to drive improved pricing and higher margins for our business. I am confident in Halliburton's strategy for profitable international growth, and I am excited about our performance in 2024 and well into the future.\nTurning to North America. Halliburton's strategy yielded strong results in 2023. Our full year North America revenue of $10.5 billion was a 9% increase when compared to 2022 despite sequentially lower rig count. Fourth quarter margins in North America land were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter despite lower revenue. Our full year and fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business and the successful execution of our strategy to maximize value.\nThe dynamic North America market continues to evolve with larger customers and stable programs, elevated quality expectations and greater demand for technology to improve recovery and well productivity. This evolution fits perfectly with Halliburton's value proposition.\nOur Zeus electric fracturing solution is highly sought after in this market, where its seamless combination of electric frac, automation and real-time subsurface measurements uniquely address customer requirements. We believe customers demand Zeus because it provides the lowest total cost of ownership and it's shown to be the most proven and reliable solution in the market.\nThe market pull for this technology has been strong. The combination of Zeus fleets working in the field today and Zeus fleets contracted for 2024 delivery represent over 40% of our fracturing fleet. I expect well over half of our fleets will be electric in 2025 with all of these e-fleets on multiyear contracts generating full return of and return on capital during their initial contract terms.\nConsistent with our strategy from the beginning, we plan for our Zeus deliveries in 2024 to replace existing fleets rather than add incremental fleet capacity. This is how we maximize value in North America. The growth of Zeus and our commercial approach has transformed the North America completion services market. Technology is only transformative when adopted and is only adopted at the rate of Zeus when it works and creates meaningful value for our customers. Zeus' rapid adoption, both by new and repeat customers, tells us our solution is the right one for North America.\nTurning to our 2024 North America outlook. We expect a continued strong business with the combination of stable levels of activity in the market and the contracted nature of Halliburton's portfolio. We expect this results in a flattish revenue and margin environment for Halliburton.\nTo close out, I am confident in our strategies to maximize value in North America and for profitable growth internationally. In 2023, Halliburton demonstrated the power of these strategies, the consistency of our execution and the value of our differentiated technology.\nWe generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the year, retired approximately $300 million of debt and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow.\nToday, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Our outlook for oilfield services remains strong, and I expect we will deepen and strengthen our value proposition and generate significant free cash flow.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. 2023 was a strong year for Halliburton. Multiple financial and operational metrics showed the best business performance in recent memory, any one of which are worthy of highlighting. More important than any single metric, however, the overall business performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy. Here are a few highlights.\nIn our C&P division, our 2023 margins of 20.7% were the highest since 2011. In our D&E division, 2023 margins of 16.5% were the highest since 2008. In North America, our strategy to maximize value is about structurally changing the risk and return profile of our business. We delivered steady margins through the year despite lower activity driven by the rollout of our Zeus fleet and their associated contract terms and the strength of our well construction business.\nInternationally, our profitable growth strategy drove revenue and margin improvement across all of our geographies. Revenue was the highest in the last 8 years, and profit margins were the highest in over a decade. Beyond pricing and activity, this is the result of the multiyear investment in our drilling business and technology differentiation across multiple product lines.\nOur focus on capital efficiency allowed this revenue growth and structural margin improvement, while capital spending remained within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Collectively, these results generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow, the highest cash generation in the last 15 years.\nLet's turn now to our fourth quarter results. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.74. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for losses in Argentina primarily due to the currency devaluation, was $0.86. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 billion. Operating income was $1.1 billion and the operating margin was 18.4%, a 95 basis point increase over Q4 2022.\nBeginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in Q4 was $3.3 billion, operating income was $716 million, and the operating income margin was 22%. Our better-than-anticipated results were driven by the best fourth quarter of completion tool sales in 9 years, strong performance across multiple product lines and favorable weather in North America.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion, operating income was $420 million, and the operating income margin was 17%, an increase of 122 basis point over Q4 last year. These results were in line with our expectation and driven by international software sales, higher project management activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and increased fluid services in the Western Hemisphere.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 4% sequentially, which was our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 and tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Q4 sequential growth was led by the Middle East region driven by improved activity across multiple product lines and strong year-end completion tool sales.\nEurope/Africa demonstrated sequential growth consistent with the overall international market with higher activity in Africa offsetting lower product sales in Europe. Latin America revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter, where reduced completion-related activity following a very strong third quarter [ upweighed ] activity improvements in the Caribbean.\nIn North America, revenue in Q4 decreased 7% sequentially driven primarily by a decline in U.S. land activity as a result of typical holiday-related slowdowns. However, we experienced fewer weather-related events than expected. As weather-related downtime is more expensive than planned downtime, this means our Q4 North America land margins were higher than anticipated. Additionally, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico delivered the strongest quarter in 3 years.\nMoving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $63 million. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect corporate expenses to be flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q4, we spent $15 million or about $0.02 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For the first quarter 2024, we expect these expenses to be approximately $30 million or $0.03 per share due to the timing associated with accelerated phases of the rollout. In 2024, we expect to spend $120 million and $80 million in 2025.\nNet interest expense for the quarter was $98 million, slightly higher than expected primarily due to premiums associated with debt buybacks. For the first quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $85 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $16 million lower than our prior guidance due to the non-GAAP treatment of the Argentinian peso devaluation. For the first quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be about $35 million.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 17.9%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, slightly lower than our anticipated full year effective tax rate.\nCapital expenditure for Q4 were $399 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion. Approximately 60% of our CapEx was deployed to international and offshore markets in 2023, and we expect this ratio to remain similar in 2024. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue.\nOur Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to about $2.3 billion. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to be directionally higher.\nNow let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of significant year-end product sales. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins lower by 125 to 175 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline between 1% to 3% and margins to be lower by 25 to 75 basis points.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow and returned over 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We're committed to return over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2024.\nFor our international business, we expect low double-digit growth driven by the power of our value proposition, global competitiveness across all product lines and our profitable growth strategy. In North America, we expect a continued strong business driven by stable activity, our differentiated technical position with our Zeus electric frac solution and the increasingly contracted nature of our business.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to the Halliburton Company Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for 7 days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nSome of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's view about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\nWe undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I am pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Let's jump right into the highlights.\nTotal company revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while operating income grew 23%. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all geographic markets. North America revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Our Completion and Production division grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while margins expanded 280 basis points. Margins expanded 105 basis points sequentially, driven by international operations, while North American C&P margins remained approximately flat to last quarter.\nOur Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 4% year-over-year, while margins expanded 168 basis points. Finally, we generated $874 million of cash from operations, $511 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock and $150 million of debt during the quarter. To our over 45,000 employees globally, thank you for another outstanding quarter. You executed our strategy and delivered excellent financial results. I'll begin with what I see in the macro environment.\nReliable and affordable energy remains at the very center of global economic growth and security. The most recent world oil outlook from OPEC expects 10 million barrels of oil demand growth before the end of the decade and further demand growth through 2045. Maintaining production, while adding incremental supply requires meaningful long-term investment in both short- and long-cycle barrels to meet demand. This challenge is reflected in our customers' activity levels and future development plans.\nConsistent with this outlook, we expect continued demand growth for oilfield services in 2024 and beyond. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction in the long duration of this upcycle. Against this backdrop, I believe the execution of our strategy will deliver strong free cash flow growing margins and more cash returned to shareholders.\nStarting with North America. Halliburton performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our North America business has changed. Despite the U.S. rig count decreasing around 20% since Q4 of 2022, Halliburton delivered strong revenue and margin performance during this period. That's quite a different result from what Halliburton would have delivered in prior cycles.\nSince 2015, we changed our strategy, we changed our operating model and the market structure changed. Our strategy in North America is to maximize value. Executing this strategy made many of our decisions over the last few years crystal clear, including our decision to invest in differentiated and value-added technologies, such as our Zeus electric fleets, automation and our fiber optic downhole fracturing diagnostics. We know that in a competitive market to capture value, you must first create value. Our decision to derisk returns and maximize free cash flow by only building fracturing equipment under long-term contracts. And finally, our decision to retire old equipment when returns are not sufficient rather than to pursue market share. Maximizing value means just that. Do the things that improve returns and stop doing the things that lower them.\nNext, we fundamentally changed our operating model. We removed $1 billion of fixed cost from our business in 2020. Those cost reductions were structural and remain in place today. As a result, today, our cost structure is more variable and less fixed. And it's one of the reasons we have the flexibility to pursue returns rather than market share. Our commitment to continuous improvement drove significant changes in the way we work. which delivered efficiency improvements in our operations. This resulted in a 68% improvement in hours pumped per crew in just the last 4 years.\nFinally, the E&P and services markets fundamentally changed. Today, the market is more consolidated, more focused on returns and more focused on free cash flow generation. We see the benefits of this change. Customers assign value to technology and efficiency and the service industry is rewarded for returns rather than growth. Never before has the success of our North America business been better aligned with the success of our customers who make significant long-term investments in the region. I expect the combination of our value proposition and strategy will deliver a more profitable business that generates more free cash flow for years to come.\nNow let's turn to international markets where Halliburton's revenue grew 17% compared to the same quarter of last year. In the third quarter, we saw activity increase in both divisions, though, particularly in our Completions and Production division. Our results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth.\nWe execute our profitable growth strategy through our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins and our unique collaborative approach with customers, all of which build on our foundation as a leader in service quality and execution. I expect the market for oilfield services will further tighten as asset-intensive offshore activity increases. More importantly, I expect that pricing returns will serve as the mechanism to allocate scarce equipment. This is a great market for Halliburton to execute its strategy for profitable international growth. I'm excited about our international business, and we are on track to deliver high teens year-on-year growth in 2023. Looking ahead, 2024 is coming into view and I expect to see international activity, again, directionally higher with market growth in the double-digit range.\nI'd like to take a few minutes and talk more about our global offshore business. Let me start with some color. Offshore represents more than 50% of our business outside of North America land. About 25% of our C&P revenue is generated offshore. More than 40% of our D&E revenue is generated offshore. All of our regions contribute materially to our offshore revenue. All of our product lines operate offshore and Halliburton leads in many well construction product lines key to offshore development.\nCustomers choose Halliburton because we collaborate and deliver impactful results. The combination of our leading product lines and our collaboration from design through well delivery is what drives superior results for our customers. One example is in Norway, where according to IHS Rushmore data, the Aker BP Alliance, where Halliburton provides well construction services consistently represents the top quartile of drilling performance. This performance matters even more in a market where offshore rig rates and spread costs are rising.\nWith our customers, we deliver some of the most technically complex wells in our industry. We provide leading solutions in many areas, including high-pressure deepwater completions, complex multilateral junctions, ultra-deep reading LWD tools, narrow-margin drilling fluids and tailored lightweight cement. These solutions enable our customers to efficiently and reliably develop their offshore reserves and maximize the value of their assets. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, underpinned by efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to compete in all parts of the offshore business, including exploration, development and intervention has never been better.\nLet me close with this. I'm both excited and confident in the outlook for our business. The duration of this up cycle, the clarity and depth of our strategy and the strength of our execution.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.79. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion, flat sequentially, while operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 3%. Operating margin for the company was 17.9% in Q3, a 207 basis point increase over Q3 2022. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.5 billion, flat sequentially, while operating income was $746 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 21%. These results were primarily due to increased stimulation activity internationally, higher cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and improved completion tool sales globally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping services in North America.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.3 billion, flat sequentially, while operating income was $378 million, which was also flat from Q2. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%, an increase of 168 basis points over Q3 last year. Sequential changes were driven by higher fluid services in Middle East/Asia and Latin America and increased wireline activity in Latin America and Europe/Africa. These were offset by decreased drilling-related services, lower project management activity and software sales in Mexico.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services and drilling fluids in Argentina, improved completion tool sales in Brazil and higher project management and drilling-related services in Colombia and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were lower software sales, decreased project management and lower well construction services in Mexico.\nEurope/Africa revenue in Q3 was $734 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by improved well construction services higher completion tool sales and improved wireline activity in Norway and higher completion tool sales in the Caspian area. These were partially offset by lower activity in Africa across multiple product service lines.\nMiddle East/Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.4 billion, which was flat from Q2. These results were driven by higher well construction in Iraq, increased drilling-related services and completion tool sales in Qatar and higher pressure pumping and fluid services in Asia. These were offset by decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait and India and lower drilling, testing and well intervention services in Asia.\nIn North America, revenue in Q3 was $2.6 billion, a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land and lower well intervention services in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases was improved completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMoving on to other items. In Q3, our corporate and other expenses were $64 million. For Q4, we expect our corporate expense to increase by about $5 million as a result of timing and special items. In Q3, we spent $23 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect these expenses to be approximately $14 million which makes our spend approximately $50 million for 2023 as planned. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, which was flat from the prior quarter. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.\nOther net expense for Q3 was $28 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to remain approximately flat.\nCapital expenditure for Q3 were $409 million. We anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $874 million and free cash flow was $511 million. We expect to generate over $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2023. Finally, consistent with our capital return policy of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock during Q3. Additionally, during Q3, we repurchased $150 million of debt.\nNow turning to our near-term outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see Q4 [ and falling ]. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate revenue to decrease by 3% to 5% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to decrease 25 to 75 basis points as a result of lower North America land activity due to holidays and lower winter month efficiencies, partially offset by higher year-end completion tool sales. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate revenue to grow by 4% to 6% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to increase 75 to 125 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher global activity.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I am pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Our North America business performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our international results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, and our ability to compete in all parts of the business has never been better.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to the Halliburton Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded.

In the second quarter, Halliburton once again delivered strong results, driven by service quality, outstanding execution and strong global demand for high-quality and high-performance oilfield services. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income grew 41% compared to second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating income. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 19% year-over-year, while margins expanded by 320 basis points. .\nOur Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while margins expanded nearly 300 basis points. Finally, we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations, $798 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares during the quarter. Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023. I'd like to thank our employees for these outstanding results. Thank you for executing on our mainstays and strategy delivery.\nNow let's turn to what I see in the markets and what I believe is driving this multiyear upcycles duration. Demand for oil and gas is strong as demonstrated by demand growth of 10 million barrels per day in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Oil and gas continues to demonstrate its critical role in the global economy and meeting long-term demand requires sustained capital investment. Commodity prices remain attractive. When I talk to customers, they expect to work more, not less, and many of their activity plans extend into the next decade. Customers are settling in for a long duration up cycle. Overall, I expect upstream spending to grow in 2023 and beyond.\nFor this year, I expect international and North America customer spending growth in the high teens and around 10%, respectively, compared to last year despite reduced rig count and completion activity in the U.S. Now let's start with our performance in the international markets. Revenue in the second quarter grew 17% compared to the same period of last year with strong activity across both divisions. Today, more than 20% of our tender pipeline represents incremental activity, which is as high as I can recall. Equally important, in addition to strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America, we see steady growth in activity across the globe. In this environment, I expect quality services and equipment to remain tight and pricing to continue to improve.\nHalliburton's strategy is to deliver profitable international growth. We are clear in how we do this through differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins and a unique collaborative approach to working with our customers. Our differentiated technology and digital portfolio deliver high quality and high performance to our customers in all markets. Here are some examples. Our drilling and LWD technology platforms deliver better reliability, data capture and efficiency for our customers while structurally expanding our margins.\nWe build and deploy leading-edge drilling equipment that requires less capital to build and operate compared to the prior generation of equipment. One example for a customer in the Middle East, Halliburton achieved a world record for the longest well ever drilled with a measured depth of over 51,000 feet using Halliburton's iCruise, iStar and LOGIX technologies. Our leading position in completions technology is unlocking production for customers.\nWe recently set another world record with the successful installation of the first 12-zone intelligent completion for a Middle East offshore customer using Halliburton's smart well technology on our e-completion platform. In our digital business, Equinor joined several other customers in selecting Landmark's decision-based 365 as their standard subsurface data interpretation tool. During the second quarter, our Landmark software business closed on the acquisition of Resoptima, a leader in advanced Ensemble modeling at the reservoir level. I'm excited about Resoptima's technology, both stand-alone and how it accelerates Landmark's road map for next-generation reservoir modeling technology.\nNow turning to collaboration. Our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and our mainstay processes define how we consistently differentiate our services. This is the source of our competitive advantage. Our value proposition creates an environment where our customers and Halliburton collectively perform better.\nA recent example of this is Halliburton and VAR Energy's announcement of a long-term strategic relationship for drilling services. I expect we will demonstrate with VAR as we have with other customers. that our collaborative approach creates significantly better operational and financial performance for both the customer and Halliburton. Our international strategy works. Our differentiated cost-effective technologies and collaborative approach with customers empower us to strategically target work where we see a competitive advantage and a clear path to outperform financially.\nTurning to North America. We delivered a solid quarter. North America revenue grew 11% versus the same period last year and margins were sequentially flat versus the last quarter. Looking ahead into the second half, I expect overall market activity in North America will be slightly lower than in the first half. More importantly, I expect Halliburton's North America margins to remain strong for the balance of the year. Our results in North America clearly demonstrate the success of our strategy to maximize value. We do this through capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers.\nDuring our last call, I outlined the steps we took in North America land to maintain pricing and deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities or retire old equipment to further accelerate Halliburton's transition to our electric fleets. Executing on our strategy during the second quarter, we deployed additional Zeus fleets on multiyear contracts while retiring additional diesel equipment. Demand for our use fleets is strong. In fact, during the second quarter, we signed more multiyear Zeus contracts than in any prior quarter. The multiyear duration of these contracts provides both stability and secure economic returns, which furthers my confidence in the strength of our margins. I continue to be impressed by the performance of our Zeus fleets and the optimization and efficiencies that come with scale. Our current system is the result of multiple iterations over several years and our continuous improvement processes.\nEvery element of the value chain from design and manufacturing to operations and maintenance is continuously improved. Our advances in pump technology and system design result in higher horsepower density and pump efficiency. With Octave we are automating equipment operation for consistency and reliability. We work to be the best at getting better. Today, Zeus is a fully integrated system. We deliver new equipment on time that works right out of the box, and on average, this year, our e-fleets pumped over 10% more hours than our high-performance diesel fleets.\nFor our customers, these improvements mean better performance and even lower total cost of ownership. For Halliburton, these improvements mean we further widen the moat around our growing e-fleet business. In all markets, international and North America, I believe our strategies yield improved financial results. Let's look at the steady growth and margin expansion in D&E. This is the result of a structural change and technology overhaul that began several years ago. Our leading drilling platforms are lower cost and higher performance than the prior generation, which drives higher asset velocity and higher returns.\nIn our testing business, our FloConnect surface well testing service provides a safe, efficient and automated platform to our customers, while lowering our overall operating costs. In our wireline business, our examiner platform provides high-quality reservoir data, reduces subsurface uncertainty and allows us to win high-value exploration work.\nFinally, across all product lines, automation and remote operations are beginning to transform service delivery, driving higher quality and reliability while lowering total cost of service delivery. Looking through any quarterly fluctuations and seasonality, I fully expect D&E margins will continue to expand over time. Our strategy also generates strong free cash flow and our capital return framework returns cash to our shareholders. I expect over 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders this year. I am pleased with where we are today.\nIn the last 18 months, we retired $1.2 billion of debt, strengthening our balance sheet, twice increased our quarterly dividend, which forms the stable foundation of our capital return framework, and finally, repurchased approximately $600 million worth of shares, including approximately $250 million this quarter. I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration up cycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow and more cash back to shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Before I begin the financial review, I'd like to discuss one item. In the second quarter, we kicked off our SAP S-4 upgrade and recorded a $13 million expense or about $0.01 per diluted share in our Q2 operating results. Future expenses will be both included in our operating results and in our quarterly guidance. Here are a few more details on the upgrade. This upgrade will take place over the next 2.5 years, concluding around Q4 2025. We expect it to provide efficiencies, cost savings and advanced analytics that will benefit Halliburton and our customers.\nThe total project investment should be approximately $250 million, $50 million this year and $100 million in each of the next 2 years. Upon completion, we expect significant ongoing savings, which will pay back the investment in about 3 years.\nNow let me move on to our quarterly results. Our second quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Excluding the effect of the transaction in Argentina, our adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.77. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 4%. Operating margin for the company was 17.4% in the second quarter a 329 basis points increase over second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating margin. These results were primarily driven by strong international activity across both divisions, along with improved pricing.\nBeginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the second quarter was $3.5 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $707 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%. These results were due to increased activity from multiple product lines in international markets and higher artificial lift activity in North America.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the second quarter was $2.3 billion, a sequential increase of 2%, while operating income was $376 million, a sequential increase of 2%. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%. These results were driven by higher drilling activity and increased fluid services in key regions, including Middle East and Latin America, partially offset by seasonal rolloff of software sales across multiple regions.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our second quarter international revenue increased 7% sequentially due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. These results were impacted by lower software sales in the Eastern Hemisphere. In North America, revenue in the second quarter was $2.7 billion, a 2% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased stimulation activity in U.S. land, partially offset by increased artificial lift activity in U.S. land and higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the second quarter was $994 million, a 9% increase sequentially, resulting from higher completion tool sales in Brazil, and improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Argentina.\nPartially offsetting this increase is reduced activity in the Caribbean across multiple product service lines. Europe Africa revenue in the second quarter was $698 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This improvement was primarily driven by increased fluid services across the region, and higher completion tool sales in Angola and Norway. Middle East Asia revenue in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, a 6% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity, drilling services and stimulation activity in the region. This improvement was partially offset by decreased project management activity in Saudi Arabia.\nMoving on to other items. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $59 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to increase by about $5 million to $10 million. As noted earlier, in the second quarter, we spent $13 million or about $0.01 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our operating results. For the third quarter, we expect these expenses to be approximately $20 million or about $0.02 per diluted share. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. The increase this quarter was primarily related to the reduction of interest income as a result of the Argentina transaction.\nFor the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $32 million. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 21.3%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to increase by approximately 50 basis points. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $303 million, we anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of our revenue.\nOur second quarter cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $798 million. We expect to generate free cash flow for the full year 2023 that is 30% to 40% higher than last year. Finally, we repurchased $248 million of our common stock during the second quarter.\nNow turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the second quarter and margins to remain approximately flat. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase in the low single digits and margins to increase 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Our international business is growing at a strong pace across all regions. I expect our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins and our unique collaborative approach to working with our customers to deliver higher international margins and growth for Halliburton. Our strategy to maximize value in North America is driven by capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I expect this will allow us to generate solid financial performance. I expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration up cycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow and more cash back to shareholders.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements.\nThese risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter again demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy, strong competitive position and execution for our customers. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. Total company revenue increased 33% compared to the first quarter of 2022 with strong activity in both North America and international markets. Operating income grew 91% year-over-year. Operating margin was 17%, a strong start to the year and 530 basis points over the first quarter of last year. International revenue grew 23% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 44% year-over-year with growth across every basin. The Completion and Production division posted 20% margins, an increase of nearly 700 basis points year-over-year. The Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 17% year-on-year while margins expanded more than 100 basis points.\nBefore we continue, I'd like to recognize the employees of Halliburton for their outstanding execution on every dimension of our business. safety, service quality and financial results. The work you do each day matters to our customers and shareholders. Thank you. I'll start with a few comments on the macro. Everything I see today validates the strength and duration of this multiyear upcycle. The world requires more energy from all sources, including oil and gas, driven by population growth and economic development. Multiple years of structural underinvestment in oil and gas supply can only be addressed by strong activity over the next several years. The commodity price volatility experienced in the first quarter does not change our view of customer demand and a tight services market. Our customers around the world recognize this, and we expect their spending to grow in 2023 and beyond.\nFurther, we expect much of this investment will be directed towards development activity, which is great for Halliburton as it drives outsized demand for our products and services. My view of this up cycle is confirmed by what I hear from our customers and see in the world's oil and gas markets. The Halliburton outlook for both the current year and the long term is strong. Now let's start with our performance in the international markets. Our revenue in the first quarter grew 23% compared to the same period of last year, reflecting strong activity in all regions. Halliburton executed its strategy to deliver profitable international growth through leading technology offerings, improved pricing and disciplined capital allocation. I expect international spending to grow high teens for the year 2023, with most new activity coming from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. I am confident in this outlook because we have a strong pipeline of awards that will commence later this year and beyond.\nOur completion tool order book grew 40% year-on-year in the first quarter, which generally represents work delivered within the current year. And finally, pricing continues to trend up for all product lines in all regions. I'm excited about all segments of our international business. Today, I'd like to provide more color on our offshore business. We generated nearly 45% of our international revenue in the first quarter from our offshore business. Here are a few examples of differentiated technologies that drive a higher level of performance, service quality and reliability for our customers.\nHalliburton's intelligent drilling and logging while drilling platforms, iCruise and iStar in combination with LOGIX, our automation platform, delivered the longest reservoir section in a single run for a customer offshore Norway. Our latest wireline imaging technology, STRATA Examiner, delivered high resolution, borehole imaging data, allowing a customer to increase reserve estimates during a recent exploration campaign in the Mediterranean Sea. Halliburton's digital solutions allow our customers to reduce cost per barrel and increase efficiencies.\nHess, Repsol and Petrobras, all recently selected Halliburton Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 applications powered by iEnergy Cloud. Our trusted science and machine learning algorithms enable customers to optimize subsurface, well construction and production-related decisions. Cognitive Halliburton's offshore automated cementing system delivers cement jobs remotely with minimal human direction and intervention. More than 30 cement jobs were completed this quarter in the North Sea alone. Finally, I'm excited about the progress of our TechnipFMC alliance on all electric completions. I believe this technology will over time, substantially change the cost and performance of deepwater completions and subsea infrastructure. As I look at 2023 and beyond, I am excited about our international business. Our customers are clearly motivated to produce more oil and gas. Service capacity is tight and pricing is increasing. Our differentiated technologies and our execution drive margin improvements and growth across our international business.\nTurning to North America. As I expected, Halliburton achieved strong results despite volatile commodity prices. We delivered on our strategic priority to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I know it's on your minds. So let me briefly discuss the natural gas markets. First, I firmly believe that the gas market softness will be solved the 6 billion cubic feet per day of additional LNG export capacity comes online in the next 24 months.\nSecond, in response to market conditions, we are moving three fleets from gas basins to oil basins to satisfy specific customer demands. Finally, we retired 1 Tier 2 diesel fleet which will reduce our near-term maintenance costs and accelerate Halliburton's transition to e-fleets. These actions reduced our gas market exposure by about 30% and maintain financial returns. I reiterate my expectation that North America customer spending will grow at least 15% in 2023. At today's oil prices, I believe that our customers will execute their activity plans and the market for highly efficient equipment and quality services will remain tight. Our strategy is to maximize value in North America.\nLet me be crystal clear about what that looks like. First, we improved the performance and utilization of our existing fleet and we align with high-quality customers who value our operational efficiency and consistent execution. Here's what the customers are telling me. Halliburton's performance is different, not only better than your competitors, but even better than your own past performance. Our step change in performance, safety and operational efficiency comes from our investments in new technologies, crew training and process improvements.\nAs a result, today, we see a 60% improvement in pumping utilization across our entire North America land fleet since 2019. Second, we only deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities. We are always finding ways to improve average fleet returns. Finally, we invest in differentiated products and services that improve margins and asset velocity. Our patented Zeus e-fleet and SmartFleet are examples they maximize asset values for our customers and structurally improve returns for Halliburton. Our Zeus e-fleets continue to outperform for our customers and smart fleet adoption is accelerating. We delivered about 6x more smart fleet stages in the first quarter than a year ago.\nHalliburton's position and outlook in North America is strengthened by the uptake and contract duration of our e-fleets. The contracting structure for e-fleets, which we only deploy on multiyear contracts and our technology road map for the future, create structural strength in Halliburton's North America business. Halliburton's e-fleet technology is proven to deliver better performance, lower total cost of ownership and increased operating efficiency. For customers with the mandate to produce barrels over the long term, and maximize the value of their investment dollars, the attraction to e-fleets is self-evident. To summarize, I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to deliver financial outperformance, our strong execution culture, differentiated technology portfolio and collaborative approach with customers give us a strong competitive advantage. I am confident that we will execute our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder returns by maximizing value in North America, delivering profitable international growth and driving capital efficiency.\nBefore I turn it over to Eric, I'd like to leave you with 2 financial points. First, given my outlook, I expect the execution of our strategy will deliver significant and growing free cash flow. Second, while our previously announced capital return framework provides a minimum of 50% free cash flow back to shareholders, it also gives us the flexibility to return more cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, a 33% increase over the first quarter of last year while operating income was $977 million, an increase of 91% year-over-year. Operating margin for the company was 17.2% in the first quarter which is an increase of 530 basis points over the first quarter of 2022. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, improved pricing and strong seasonal product and software sales. Our first quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, which more than doubled from the same period last year.\nBeginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the first quarter was $3.4 billion, a 45% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 while operating income was $666 million, an increase of 125% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%, driven by increased activity, improved pricing and service efficiency in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the first quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, while operating income was $369 million an increase of 26% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. D&E delivered an operating income margins of 16% and driven by strong wireline, testing and drilling-related services globally and an uptick in international activity.\nNow let's move on to geographic results. Our first quarter international revenue increased 23% year-over-year due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. In North America, revenue in the first quarter was $2.8 billion, a 44% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased stimulation activity and efficiencies, higher activity across our well construction product lines in North America land as well as higher activity across multiple product lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the first quarter was $915 million, a 40% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to increased well construction services and stimulation activity in Mexico and Argentina, and higher completion tool sales across the region.\nEurope Africa revenue in the first quarter was $662 million, a 2% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the sale of our Russian operations, along with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Norway. This decrease was partially offset by increased well construction services and stimulation activity throughout Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a 30% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales, improved well construction services and increased project management activity across the region.\nNow I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $58 million. For the second quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be up about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to be about flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $69 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to decline approximately $15 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to increase about 50 basis points.\nCapital expenditure for the first quarter were $268 million. We anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year and total capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of our revenue for the full year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $122 million, and free cash flow was a use of $105 million. These results were primarily driven by seasonal investments in working capital. As is typical for our business, we anticipate our cash flow will be back-end loaded for the year. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the rest of 2023. As a step toward achieving Halliburton's capital return policy of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock during the first quarter.\nFinally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be partially offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. As a result, we anticipate sequential D&E revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to decline 50 to 100 basis points. In the Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Halliburton Co.\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. My outlook for Halliburton is strong. I expect international year-on-year growth in the high teens North America growth in excess of 15%. And finally, everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. And now let's open it up for questions."

Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton finished the year strong with solid financial and operational performance in both divisions and both hemispheres. Halliburton's execution in 2022 demonstrates the earnings power of our strategy, and I expect this earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond.\nLet's jump right into the 2022 highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $20.3 billion and operating income of $2.7 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 70% compared to 2021 with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our full year international revenue grew 20% over 2021, and our revenue and operating income increased each quarter in 2022. I am pleased with the international growth and margin progression Halliburton demonstrated this year despite a second quarter exit from our Russian business.\nOur full year North America revenue increased 51% over 2021 with improved margins driven by activity and pricing gains. Both our Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production divisions grew revenue and margins this year. The Drilling and Evaluation division generated full year operating margins of 15%, an increase of 320 basis points over 2021. The steady expansion of D&E margins demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Our Completion and Production division posted 18% full year operating margins, a year-over-year increase of 290 basis points, driven by activity and pricing improvements.\nWe generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, retired $1.2 billion of debt, maintained capital spending within 5% to 6% of revenues and ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash on hand. Finally, our service quality performance excelled in 2022. Nonproductive time improved by 7% over 2021, which drove the highest ever uptime across our business. Execution is at the heart of who we are and our results are a testament to our employees' continued commitment to superior service quality.\nI'm pleased with the fourth quarter results. Revenue grew 4% and operating income grew 15% sequentially. Margins increased in both C&P and D&E divisions and in both hemispheres. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $856 million.\nBuilding on the strong foundation of execution, today, I am pleased to announce the following shareholder return actions: first, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2023, representing a 33% increase from last year; second, we have resumed share buybacks under our existing Board authorization of approximately $5 billion and in the fourth quarter of 2022, bought back shares totaling $250 million; finally, our Board approved a capital return framework that we expect going forward to return at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\nThese actions demonstrate Halliburton's confidence in our business, customers, employees and industry outlook. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success this quarter and throughout 2022 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. I thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance.\nNow let's turn to the macro outlook where everything I see today points towards continued oil and gas tightness. On the supply side, in the U.S., an increased spend of almost 50% and activity growth of nearly 30% yielded a production increase of about 5%. Given the increased spend required to grow and replace production, I expect activity to remain strong and service intensity to increase through 2023. I see the same supply side challenges in the international markets. One indicator being that despite OPEC's 2022 production quotas, several members did not meet their goals.\nOn the demand side, we saw the resilience of oil and gas demand throughout 2022, even as Central Banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. I expect oil and gas demand to remain strong. As we start 2023, I also expect China's reopening to further increase demand. It's clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply.\nI believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years. The unique feature of this up cycle, as I see it, is the investor-driven return discipline by both operators and service companies, which I expect drives a longer duration cycle and translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services.\nNow let's turn to Halliburton, starting with our performance in the international markets. We successfully executed our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through competitive technology offerings, improved pricing and selective contract wins. International revenue grew 20% year-on-year with strong growth and margin expansion from both divisions. This gives me confidence in the earnings power of our international strategy.\nIn 2023, we expect international activity to grow at least mid-teens with most new activity coming from the Middle East and Latin America. As this up cycle continues, I believe that we will see substantial growth in all international markets, both onshore and offshore, led by development activity and increased spend at the wellbore.\nThis is excellent news for Halliburton. About half our revenue comes from international markets. We have leading positions in key well construction product lines and a strong geographic footprint. I'm excited about the growth and profit opportunities that will come with the adoption of our new drilling technology platforms. Our iCruise drilling technology, iStar logging while drilling platform and LOGIX automation capabilities. Each of these technologies are in different stages of implementation, and we are already seeing benefits.\nOur iCruise directional drilling system represents about half of our rotary steerable fleet while drilling about 70% of our global footage. It is a key contributor to increasing international profitability. Our iStar logging while drilling platform now delivers high-definition measurements closer to the bit and deeper into the formation.\nWhile early in its rollout with only 600,000 feet logged, the iStar platform directly complements the iCruise directional drilling system. Finally, LOGIX automates drilling with iCruise and iStar. With more than 7 million feet drilled in 20-plus countries, the LOGIX platform reduces operational risk and delivers wells reliably.\nTurning to North America. We had a terrific year. Our performance demonstrated our strategy to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, improved pricing, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. In 2022, our North America revenue grew 51% year-over-year, while revenue in the fourth quarter was flat sequentially due to weather-related downtime late in the year.\nLooking ahead, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to grow by at least 15% in 2023. The market for equipment is tight. Lead times for new and replacement equipment remain long and service companies remain disciplined. Our completions calendar is fully booked and pricing continues to improve across all product service lines.\nAgainst this constructive market backdrop, Halliburton will outperform with our unique strategy to maximize value. We see strong demand for our Zeus e-fleets with several repeat customers contracting additional fleets. Zeus is a proven design with a strong operational track record. Our new automated fracturing platform, OCTIV, fully automates equipment operation, reduces maintenance and extends component life. We are in the early innings of this rollout, having proven it over 15,000 stages, and I expect it to drive higher capital efficiency.\nFinally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system is gaining significant traction with customers. SmartFleet data helps customers answer key questions such as the existence of flow barriers, well interference, parent-child performance and depletion, all to improve completion performance. These are a few examples of how technology maximizes value in North America. Each example delivers better margins either by reducing capital cost or increasing capital velocity, and in many cases, both.\nHalliburton is unique and is the only integrated services company to have a strong presence in both North America and international markets, a strong execution culture and differentiated technology. We will continue to sharpen our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers.\nI am confident in Halliburton's strong long-term outlook. This is the best setup and market outlook for oilfield services in Halliburton that I have seen in a very long time. Our exceptional financial performance this year is a clear result of the execution of our strategic priorities to maximize value in North America, deliver profitable international growth and drive capital efficiency. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance.\nNow I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion, a 4% increase over the third quarter while operating income was $976 million, an increase of 15% over third quarter operating income. Operating margin for the company was 17.5% in the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, pricing and year-end product and software sales.\nOur fourth quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, an increase of $0.12 or 20% from the third quarter. Our 2022 full year adjusted net income per diluted share nearly doubled from 2021. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion, a 1% increase when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $659 million, an increase of 13% when compared to the third quarter.\nDespite weather-related downtime late in the year, C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20.7%, the highest operating income margin since 2012. This was due to improved pricing, service efficiency, and activity mix in North America land as well as increased activity in international markets.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $387 million, an increase of 19% when compared to the third quarter. These results were driven by higher year-end software sales and an uptick in international activity. Operating margin increased 210 basis points above Q4 2021, which demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business.\nMoving on to geographic results. Our international revenue increased 9% sequentially due to solid year-end sales, pricing gains and activity increases. In North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion, a 1% decrease when compared to the third quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by weather-related downtime in North America land.\nLatin America revenue in the fourth quarter was $945 million, a 12% increase sequentially due to higher activity in Mexico and across the region. Europe/Africa revenue in the fourth quarter was $657 million, a 3% increase sequentially, driven by higher completion tool sales, drilling activity and well intervention services across the region. These increases were partially offset by lower activity in Norway.\nMiddle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily resulting from higher software sales and drilling and evaluation services across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $70 million. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $74 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances and debt retirement in September.\nFor the first quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $60 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to be slightly lower. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter effective tax rate to increase roughly 150 basis points. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $350 million, with our 2022 full year CapEx totaling approximately $1 billion.\nTurning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash.\nNext, I'd like to provide a few more details about our capital return framework. First, an important pillar of our capital framework is to maintain CapEx between 5% and 6% of revenue. I believe the spending level is appropriate and supports our earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years.\nSecond, we expect to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share, effective with a dividend payment in March 2023. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and we have remaining authorization of approximately $5 billion.\nWe were clear about our goals to reduce debt and increased cash returns to shareholders, and I am pleased that we've announced these actions today. I believe Halliburton's capital return framework provides visibility for investors and affords us the flexibility to pursue acquisitions and strengthen the balance sheet.\nNow let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which will mostly impact our international business. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter, while margins will drop between 75 and 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the low to mid-single digits sequentially, while margins are expected to be down 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Oil and gas is tight and only multiple years of increased investment will solve short supply, which translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. The announced dividend increase share buybacks and Halliburton's new capital return framework provides shareholders with clarity and consistency on how we expect to return cash to shareholders. This exceptional financial performance is a clear result of our execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance, strong free cash flow and shareholder returns.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to Halliburton's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of IR, Halliburton Company\n\nHello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, EVP and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. .\nThese risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook today is strong. Oil and gas supply remains tight for the foreseeable future. International market activity is accelerating and North America service capacity continues to further tighten. As a result, pricing is moving up in both markets.\nHalliburton's strong third quarter results demonstrate the power of our strategy. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially as both North America and international activity continue to expand. Operating income grew 18% compared to adjusted operating income from the second quarter with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our overall operating income margin was 16% representing 45% incremental margins over last quarter's adjusted operating income.\nOur Completion and Production division revenue increased 8% over last quarter, driven by completions activity and pricing in North America and international markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 19% in the third quarter. The Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 3%. Operating margin of 15% increased 140 basis points sequentially and 380 basis points above the same period last year, demonstrating the earnings power and global competitiveness of our D&E business.\nNorth America revenue grew almost 9% sequentially as both drilling and completions activity improved throughout the third quarter. Pricing gains and activity increases across both divisions drove these results. International revenue grew 3% sequentially with improved activity in the Middle East and Latin America that more than offset the revenue decline related to exiting our Russia business.\nImportantly, during the third quarter, we generated similar incremental margins in both international and North America markets. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $543 million and retired $600 million of debt during the quarter. I am pleased with the third quarter results. I want to express my appreciation to the men and women of Halliburton whose hard work and dedication made these results possible. Your commitment to collaboration, safety and service quality every day make Halliburton successful.\nTurning to our macro outlook. Oil and gas supply remains fundamentally tight due to multiple years of underinvestment. This tightness is apparent in historically low inventory levels, production levels well below expectations and temporary actions such as the largest ever SPR release. Against tight supply, demand for oil and gas is strong, and we believe it will remain so. While broader market volatility is clear, what we see in our business is strong and growing demand for equipment and services.\nThere is no immediate solution to balance the world's demand for secure and reliable oil and gas against its limited supply. I believe that only multiple years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production will solve the short supply. The effective solution to short supply is conventional and unconventional, deepwater and shallow water, new and existing developments and short- and long-cycle barrels. All of it.\nI expect progress towards increased supply will be measured in years, not months, as behavior of both operators and service companies have changed. Operators remain disciplined. Their commitments to investor returns require a measured approach to growth and investment. Service companies follow the same discipline, delivering on their commitments to investor returns and taking a measured approach to growth and investment.\nWhat I think is underappreciated is how this results in more sustainable growth and returns over a longer period of time. Let's turn now to Halliburton's performance, starting with the international markets. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through improved pricing, selective contract wins and the competitiveness of our technology offerings.\nInternational revenue in the third quarter for the C&P and D&E divisions grew year-over-year from a percentage standpoint in the high teens and mid-20s, respectively, which outpaced international rig count growth and reflects our competitiveness in all markets. Our year-over-year growth and the margin expansion demonstrated by both divisions give me confidence in the earnings power of our international business.\nLooking forward, I see activity increasing around the world, from the smallest to the largest countries and producers. I expect the areas of strongest growth will be the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, but with meaningful activity increases in the UAE, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait. Elsewhere, Brazil, Guyana and many others have also signaled a commitment to increased activity.\nThroughout these markets, I am pleased with the broad adoption of our new directional drilling platform such as iCruise and EarthStar. Importantly, these broad-based activity increases serve to tighten equipment availability and drive price increases in our international business.\nShifting to North America. We had a fantastic quarter. Our solid performance demonstrates our strategy to maximize value in North America. We achieved this through improved pricing, partnering with high-quality customers and differentiated technology. Our revenue grew 9% sequentially and is up 63% over the third quarter last year. Pricing continues to improve across all product lines and completions equipment remains extremely tight across the market.\nInterest in e-fleets is strong and customers are pleased with the superior efficiencies, operational uptime and reduced carbon footprint of our market-leading solution. Looking into 2023. I see continued growth. The inbounds for calendar slots are stronger than I have ever seen at this point in the year.\nMore importantly, I see increased demand for a limited set of equipment and an environment where technology and performance are increasingly valued, all perfectly set up for Halliburton to maximize value in North America. Market consolidation, competitors that answer to public investors, disciplined customers and supply chain constraints all drive the services market that I expect to remain tight for the foreseeable future.\nHalliburton will continue to outperform in this market. Our best-in-class Zeus e-fleets have pumped over 20,000 hours for customers. Our e-fleet customers know that they have a field-proven technology which carries the full weight of Halliburton's expertise to build, run and optimize this next-generation equipment.\nAdditionally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system continues to gain traction, and we expect an almost eightfold increase in stages completed this year. SmartFleet gives customers unparalleled access to data about where and how their fractures permeate, the potential for frac hits on adjacent wells and the real-time data necessary to improve completion designs.\nIn all markets, Halliburton's strong financial performance demonstrates its strategy and action, profitable international growth, maximizing value in North America and improved asset velocity to deliver value for our shareholders today. These strategies equip us to outperform under any market conditions, but especially to maximize returns through this up cycle.\nExecution is at the heart of Halliburton's identity. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. You've seen that in action in today's results. You can hear how excited I am about Halliburton's future all around the world. The structural demand for more oil and gas supply provides strong tailwinds for our business and Halliburton is ideally positioned to deliver improved profitability and increased returns for shareholders.\nNow I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our third quarter financial results\nEric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, a 6% increase over the second quarter while operating income was $846 million, an increase of 18% over second quarter adjusted operating income. Globally, higher activity and pricing improvement supported these strong results. .\nOperating margin for the company was 16% in the third quarter, a 164 basis point increase over second quarter adjusted operating margin and 393 basis points over adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of 2021. Our third quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.60, an increase of $0.11 or 22% from second quarter adjusted net income per diluted share and more than doubled the adjusted net income per diluted share for the same period last year.\nBeginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the third quarter was $3.1 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the second quarter while operating income was $583 million, an increase of 17% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services, primarily in North America land and increased completion tool sales in Middle East Asia.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the third quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% when compared to the second quarter while operating income was $325 million, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services in Latin America and Middle East Asia and increased project management and wireline services internationally.\nThe exit from our Russia business negatively impacted financial results for both divisions. Moving on to geographic results. In North America, revenue in the third quarter was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase when compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and drilling-related services in North America land. These increases were partially offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico.\nLatin America revenue in the third quarter was $841 million, an 11% increase sequentially driven by increased well construction services and project management activity in Mexico. Europe Africa revenue in the third quarter was $639 million, an 11% decrease sequentially. Almost all of this reduction was related to exiting our Russia business.\nMiddle East Asia revenue in the third quarter was $1.2 billion, a 6% increase sequentially primarily resulting from increased completion tool sales in the Arabian Gulf and higher drilling services activity in Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expenses were $62 million, which was in line with expectations.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be up slightly or roughly in line with second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to decrease slightly due to lower debt balances. Other net expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to increase slightly. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were $251 million. We expect our full year capital expenditure to be in line with our target of 5% to 6% of revenue.\nTurning to cash flow. We generated $753 million of cash from operations and $543 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect full year free cash flow to be in the range of last year's free cash flow. With the latest payment of $600 million, we have now retired $2.4 billion of debt since 2020. We're quickly approaching our near-term leverage target of 2x gross debt-to-EBITDA.\nGiven our balance sheet position and strong outlook, we now have greater flexibility to increase the cash we'll return to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks under our existing repurchase program. Now let me turn to the near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 50 to 100 basis points.\nIn the Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's third quarter financial performance shows our strategy in action, delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply remains tight, requiring multiple years of investment. Demand for Halliburton services is strong. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities that drive free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. And now let's open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions).\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Our financial performance shows that our strategy is working and driving value.\nLet's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 18% sequentially as both North America and international activity continued to improve in unison. Adjusted operating income grew 35% with strong margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 24% driven by robust completions activity in North America and international markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 17% in the second quarter, the first time it reached this level since 2014.\nOur Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 12%. Operating margin of 13% was down sequentially as expected due to the seasonal drop-off in software sales but increased 270 basis points year-on-year. This gives us confidence in the strengthening margin profile of our D&E business.\nNorth America revenue grew 26% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the second quarter. Strong net pricing gains across all product service lines supported sequential margin expansion. International revenue grew 12% sequentially with activity accelerating in all international regions, particularly Latin America and the Middle East. Finally, we recorded a historic best operational performance as measured by nonproductive time for the first 6 months of this year.\nI am pleased with the strong performance Halliburton delivered in the first half of this year, and I thank all Halliburton employees for their hard work, contribution to these outstanding results and dedication to superior service quality.\nBefore we discuss our execution in the international and North America markets, let me address recent market volatility. In the second quarter, central banks took actions in an attempt to control inflation, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Despite this near-term volatility, I believe the oil and gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multiyear energy upcycle.\nFrom a demand perspective, oil and gas remains a critical component of long-term economic growth. Post-pandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, oil and gas supply is tight, despite an environment muted by ongoing China lockdowns and jet fuel demand below historical norms. Meaningful supply solutions will take time, OPEC spare capacity is at historical lows, the strategic petroleum reserve release is unsustainable, and the risk to Russia supply remains high.\nOn the industry side, despite high commodity prices, operators remain disciplined because of investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure. In response, service companies invested for returns and did not overbuild. In short, this cycle has been nothing like prior cycles. This means any economic slowdown will not solve the structural oil undersupply problem.\nAt Halliburton, the steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet best equip us to outperform under any market conditions. Here's why we believe that. First, we used the pandemic to redesign the cost profile of our business. We structurally removed over $1 billion of costs, the most aggressive cost reductions in our history. This gives us strong and sustainable operating leverage that we see today in meaningful year-on-year margin expansion in both divisions.\nSecond, we fundamentally lowered the capital intensity of our business and set our CapEx target at 5% to 6% of revenue compared to 10% to 11% in the prior upcycle. We advanced our technology so that new generations of equipment would have higher capital velocity. This lower capital profile is key to our strong free cash flow generation.\nFinally, we prioritize strengthening our balance sheet and retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. This reduced our cash interest expense and put us within striking distance of our leverage targets.\nNow let's turn to our second quarter performance and expectations for the rest of 2022. With energy security firmly in focus, the diversification of supply sources is the central theme in the international markets. Never has energy security been a bigger issue to governments and people all over the world. However, political agendas and years of underinvestment in many markets make it harder to address this critical requirement.\nAs I look across the international markets, our customer spend remains on track to increase by mid-teens this year, with the Middle East and Latin America expected to grow the most on a full year basis. New project announcements across the world, including in the Eastern Mediterranean, Australia and West Africa, give us confidence in continued activity acceleration in 2023 and beyond. Longer term, we believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from the upcycle than ever before.\nWe have a strong portfolio of well construction and completion product service lines. We greatly increased our drilling competitiveness. We are present in all the markets that matter and we have unique growth opportunities in the production space.\nLet me elaborate. The activity mix in this upcycle is different from prior cycles. Today, operators focus more on developing known resources and less on long-term exploration programs. This means drilling more wellbores. The products and services customers require for drilling more wellbores benefit Halliburton. For example, in one of the largest international offshore markets, over 60% of a typical well service cost goes to drilling fluids, cementing and completion hardware. This means more operators spend on services where Halliburton has a leading position.\nBaroid, our drilling and completion fluids business entered this cycle as the leading fluids provider globally. During the downturn, we brought the chemical supply chain closer to our international customers and localized our workforce. This improved our cost competitiveness and the margins. We introduced new advanced chemistries and now run fluid systems that make better wellbores and create value for our customers and Halliburton through higher margins and lower inventory requirements.\nHalliburton was founded as a cementing company over 100 years ago. And since then, we never stopped leading and innovating in cementing. Every well in the world, be it a mature producer in the Middle East or a deepwater wellbore in Brazil, must be cemented. The secret to our enduring success in cementing is our capacity and drive to innovate and develop new methods to design, deliver and validate sustainable well barriers.\nOur latest innovation is the Cognitus Automated Cementing Platform, which allows us to deliver cement jobs autonomously. With limited human direction and intervention, a standard offshore cementing operation typically requires over 300 commands. The Cognitus platform consolidates and automates this to only 5 mouse clicks by an onshore operator. We already completed over 70 cementing jobs using this system in the North Sea delivering safer operations, improved service quality and cost efficiency.\nWell completion tools constitute a larger portion of well services spend internationally than in North America, and they are high-tech and high value-add products and services. Halliburton is a global leader in completions technology, especially in advanced completions that include sand control solutions, multilateral wells and intelligent completions.\nWith over 20 years of multilateral installation experience globally, Halliburton is the market leader in multilaterals, a key technical component in many development wells. They help operators increase reservoir drainage in mature fields, address limited subsea infrastructure and reduce environmental impact.\nOver the past few years, we've strengthened our completion tools product service line in Singapore, which is closer to our international customer base and supply chain sources. With our world-class manufacturing facilities, strong local technical support and continuous innovation, Halliburton completion tools position us to outperform in the international upcycle.\nAnother key well construction service is directional drilling. Over the last 5 years, we made a concerted effort to improve our drilling technology competitiveness. Our strong D&E margin performance this year demonstrates that our investment is paying off and we expect it to continue as international drilling activity ramps up. Our iCruise intelligent drilling system delivers excellent results. It now constitutes about half of our rotary steerable fleet and has been a key contributor to year-over-year margin improvements, which reflects its higher asset velocity compared to prior generation tools.\nLast month, for a Middle East customer, Halliburton achieved a new world record, the longest well ever drilled at 50,000 feet measured depth. This extended reach well redefined what's possible with advanced drilling technology.\nIn many regions, as customers face increasing operational challenges and urgency to increase production, I expect that the adoption of integrated contracts will continue to grow. Today, about 20% of our international revenue comes from integrated projects, and this percentage is considerably higher in some markets like Norway, Mexico and Iraq.\nHalliburton's strong project management capabilities and a proven track record, compress the learning curve and drive cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. The future is without a doubt, more collaborative. Customers across the world increasingly call on Halliburton for collaboration and that perfectly fits with our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value.\nGeographic presence is very important in the international markets, and today, we are present everywhere that matters, which is different from prior cycles. We expect to benefit from our established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships as international markets grow.\nFinally, I want to highlight the international growth opportunity Halliburton has in artificial lift and specialty chemicals, which is new for this upcycle. This month, we completed our first year of operations on our electric submersible pump contract in Kuwait. We have already installed almost 200 ESPs, built an artificial lift service facility in country and delivered excellent performance for KOC. We also have successful installations in Oman and have ongoing ESP trials in Saudi Arabia. Upon completion of trials at the end of the year, we expect prequalification to participate in Saudi Aramco's future artificial lift tenders.\nLatin America is another successful market for our artificial lift business, where we operate in all significant land markets and just installed our 500th ESP in Ecuador. Our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia mixed the first batch of chemicals last month and is on track to meet its ramp-up goals. This year, we expect the plant to manufacture products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our drilling fluids, specialty chemicals and hydraulic fracturing product service lines.\nToday, Halliburton is a much stronger international competitor and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth.\nTurning to North America. This market remains strong, steadily growing and all of it sold out. Our strategic priority is to maximize value in North America by focusing on cash flow and returns, not market share. The second quarter saw another step-up in both U.S. land rig activity and stages completed. With the first quarter sand supply interruptions resolved, frac activity steadily increased throughout the quarter.\nAs we look at the second half of 2022, Halliburton remains sold out. As for the overall market, I believe it will be all but sold out for the second half of the year due to service company discipline, long lead times for new fleets and supply chain bottlenecks for consumables. We expect public companies will steadily execute on their drilling and completion programs. Private E&Ps capitalized on available rigs and equipment in the first half of the year and will likely maintain a measured level of activity growth for the rest of the year.\nWe continue to believe that North America operator spending growth will eclipse 35% this year. Our customer conversations have already pivoted to 2023 plans well in advance of the typical time frame. These conversations make it clear that equipment capacity for 2023 is tight. Today, we see a services market in North America that is almost unrecognizable from prior cycles or even a handful of years ago. I believe that the returns focus we now see in the services market is not a temporary phenomenon. The largest world publicly traded pressure pumping companies now account for about 2/3 of the market. This means that investors force discipline on the majority of the industry today.\nIn addition, industry consolidation, structural changes to customer behavior and the requirement to self-fund capital investments all drive capital discipline. In short, it's the result of rational economic behavior and I believe that it is here to stay.\nHalliburton is well prepared to compete in this new paradigm in North America. We have the largest technology budget in the North American services industry and our advanced technologies deliver what matters to operators: efficiency, insight and emissions reduction. For example, today, our customers can reduce environmental impact with our proven Zeus electric frac offering and optimize completions performance by capturing downhole insight with our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution. We operate in every major oil and gas basin across the United States using the same design of equipment built by in-house manufacturing to our specifications. This one design approach greatly simplifies equipment maintenance and helps minimize the supply chain challenges for spares and equipment.\nFinally, we have global capabilities in managing supply chain and labor complexities that we believe give us a distinct competitive advantage over domestic service providers. To conclude on North America. I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold-out market. Globally, supply chain and labor shortages are front and center for many industries as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both raw material supply and transportation logistics. I believe Halliburton manages these shortages better than competitors.\nOur global business development, supply chain and technology organizations closely monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale and global procurement, technology modifications and efficient sourcing practices. For example, as chemical costs increase, we work with our customers to adjust our pricing for cost inflation. Operators appreciate that these price adjustments are required for us to continue delivering our services. Most customers expect and accept these adjustments.\nHalliburton's world-class technology organization gives us the ability to change formulations for certain products to avoid the most inflationary inputs. We have already implemented these design changes for some of our drilling fluids and completion tool elastomers.\nFinally, we have internal chemical manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which allow us to diversify supply, mitigate risk and better control input prices. In North America, we employ our global HR capabilities for managing commuter labor to hire out of basin and avoid labor shortage pressures in local markets. This allows us to secure talent from states outside of white hot labor markets in traditional oil and gas basins. At the same time, our voluntary attrition numbers remained stable, both globally and the U.S. This demonstrates that once we attract the right talent, we provide them with the right incentives and growth opportunities.\nTurning now to pricing dynamics that we see playing out in North America and internationally. As I stated before, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle. In North America, net pricing improvements drove our strong C&P margin expansion in the second quarter, and I expect pricing gains to continue. Here's why. Existing active equipment and experienced crews are in high demand and will continue to be highly sought after to efficiently execute programs in the second half of this year and into 2023. The market remains all but sold out. Supply chain bottlenecks even for diesel fleets make it almost impossible to add incremental capacity this year.\nHalliburton has the additional advantage that our fleet primarily competes at the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Our portfolio of low emissions equipment commands premium prices and our customers see value in the efficiency and emissions profile we provide.\nInternationally, we see structural tightness in many product lines, particularly drilling and wireline. Increasing activity soaks up capacity market-wide. And recently, some customer request for additional equipment had to go unanswered. As equipment availability continues to tighten, we expect prices will increase further.\nDue to the long-term nature of international contracts, only about 1/3 of our work reprices every year. This means that margin and pricing inflections internationally will always materialize at a slower pace than in North America. We see evidence of customer urgency indicated by customer preference to pursue direct negotiations for contract extensions.\nThe efficiency gains over the last several years have all accrued directly to operators, and there is still a great deal of room in customers' economics for service providers to earn a fair and durable return. So it often goes unsaid, a robust and investable service industry is a key enabler of our customers' ability to grow and maintain production to address the world's energy needs.\nI'm thrilled with Halliburton's performance in the second quarter and our immediate and long-term opportunities. Our team is executing well on near-term tactical objectives and the long-term strategic priorities provide real tangible value for Halliburton and our shareholders. Halliburton's competitive position is unique among our peers. We have the scale and technology to benefit meaningfully and differentially from the international market expansion, and we are the leader in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out North American market. I could not be more excited about the future of Halliburton.\nNow I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Eric?\n\nEric J. Carre\n\nCFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $718 million, an increase of 18% and 35%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and net pricing gains supported these strong results. In the second quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $344 million as a result of our decision to exit Russia due to sanctions.\nNow let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more details. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 24% while operating income was $499 million, an increase of 69%. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services in the Western Hemisphere, higher completion tool sales globally, increased artificial lift activity in North America land and Kuwait, and improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Oman and decreased artificial lift activity in Latin America.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% increase, while operating income was $286 million, a decrease of 3%. This revenue increase was due to higher fluid services and wireline activity globally, increased project management activity in Latin America and the Middle East, and increased drilling services in Latin America. Operating income decrease was driven by seasonally lower software sales globally and decreased drilling services in Brazil.\nMoving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue grew 26% primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in North America land, increased fluid services, wireline activity, well intervention services and higher completion tool sales across the region and increased cementing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico.\nTurning to Latin America. Revenue increased 16% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina and Colombia, increased stimulation and well construction services in Mexico, increased drilling-related services in the Caribbean, improved stimulation activity in Brazil and higher project management activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased drilling-related services in Brazil and lower artificial lift activity in Argentina and Ecuador.\nIn Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 6% resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in Angola and Eastern Mediterranean, improved cementing activity, pipeline services, wireline activity, and testing services across the region and increased through its services and completion tool sales in the U.K. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the wind down of our business in Russia and decreased drilling services in Norway.\nIn the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 14% primarily resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Middle East, Australia and Brunei. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Oman. All regions experienced a seasonal decline in software sales.\nIn the second quarter, our corporate and other expense was $67 million which was higher than expected due to the timing of employee incentives. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $101 million and should remain about flat for the third quarter. Other net expense for the quarter was $42 million primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain about flat.\nOur normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be slightly higher. Capital expenditure for the quarter were $221 million and will steadily increase for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect our CapEx to remain at 5% to 6% of revenue.\nTurning to cash flow. We generated $376 million of cash from operation and $215 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Working capital investments grew to support the 18% sequential revenue growth. As is typical for business in an upcycle, we anticipate free cash flow for the year to be back-end loaded and expect to generate free cash flow at or above last year's level.\nNow let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our third quarter revenue to grow in the low to middle single digits. As a result of activity improvements, we expect D&E margins to be flat to up 50 basis points.\nI will now turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThanks, Eric. To summarize our discussion today, we are still in the early innings of a multiyear upcycle. The oil supply and demand fundamentals remain constructive for both international and North America markets. The steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet set Halliburton up to outperform under any market conditions.\nInternationally, Halliburton is a much stronger competitor, and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. In North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in this strong, steadily growing and all but sold out market. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving profitable growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear upcycle unfolds. And now let's open it up for questions."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Coleman\n\nSenior Director of IR, Halliburton Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO.\nSome of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual financial results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nOur comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release or in the Quarterly Results and Presentation section of our website. (Operator Instructions).\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with Halliburton's first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates the resilience of our unique strategy in action and the importance of our competitive positioning both in North America and international markets.\nHere are some highlights from the first quarter. International revenue grew 15% compared to the first quarter of 2021, with activity accelerating across all international markets. Strong growth in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia offset the winter weather impacts in Europe. In North America, revenue grew 37% year-on-year with the acceleration of both drilling and completions activity. Higher utilization in March and net pricing gains drove margin expansion despite weather and sand disruptions earlier in the quarter.\nOur Completion and Production division revenue grew 26% and compared to the first quarter of 2021 on activity increases in North America, Africa and the Middle East, while operating income increased 17% despite transitory U.S. land/sand delivery disruptions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 22% year-on-year, while margins expanded 440 basis points and started the year at 15% for the first time since 2010. This exceptional performance was largely driven by the strength of our directional drilling and project management businesses.\nWe added 3 new companies to Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. This brings the total number of program participants and alumni to 15 companies. Halliburton Labs allows us to actively participate in the future of clean energy value chain. Finally, we retired $600 million of our $1 billion of debt maturing in 2025 and nearly tripled our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. These actions strengthen our balance sheet and reflect our commitment to return cash to shareholders.\nBefore we continue, I want to provide a few comments about the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. This is a tragedy on many dimensions and for us, especially for our people in both countries. As we've all seen, governments in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and other countries swiftly enacted far-reaching sanctions on new investment and export controls on goods, supplies and technologies to Russia.\nIn compliance with sanctions and consistent with our strategy for profitable international growth, we announced that we would begin steps toward a wind-down of our Russian operations, and we remain active in that process. Russia accounts for about 2% of our business. Sanctions and export compliance impact everyone in the oilfield and operations and supply chains in Russia are, at best, challenged. The situation is far too early and evolving to say more.\nMoving on to our macro outlook. We expect oil and gas demand will grow over the near and medium term, driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns and population growth. At the same time, supply remains under structural threat of scarcity. While the war in Ukraine has created a short-term dislocation in commodity markets, the fundamental supply tightness existed before this geopolitical conflict. Current oil supply tightness and commodity price levels strengthen my confidence in the accelerating multiyear upcycle and very busy years ahead for Halliburton.\nIn addition, I expect an important change in our customers' behavior and priorities will provide structural support to oil prices throughout this upcycle. I believe supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure, which make it more difficult for operators to commit to long-cycle hydrocarbon investments and instead drive investment flexibility through short-cycle barrels.\nThe pursuit of increased investment flexibility leads operators to prioritize short-cycle projects, development over exploration, tiebacks versus new infrastructure and shale rather than deepwater. Clearly, there are important exceptions where successful long-term projects will be developed, but painting with a broad brush, I believe most investments will be directed primarily towards short-cycle activity in the near and medium term. The result of this focus is an industry-wide increase in the level of investment flexibility for operators and the subsequent support to commodity prices.\nWith short-cycle barrels, companies make investment decisions annually and can respond more quickly to commodity price signals. As a result, when investment stops, production at a minimum doesn't grow. And in the case with unconventionals, it quickly declines. For example, when the pandemic drove the collapse of oil demand 2 years ago, U.S. shale companies swiftly reduced activity and production declined 2 million barrels in 9 months.\nIn contrast, long-cycle projects have 2 key elements: a long-time horizon and large upfront capital investment. Once these projects begin, investment continues and production cannot quickly respond to price signals. This tends to result in market oversupply. The pivot to short-cycle barrels creates the opposite effect, a perpetual threat of undersupply that is supportive to commodity price.\nI believe this pivot to short-cycle barrels is great for Halliburton and sets up fantastic conditions for us to outperform. Short-cycle activity results in higher relative capital spend by operators aimed directly at the wellbore for services Halliburton provides as opposed to infrastructure investments required for long-cycle projects. Our strong technology portfolio and market footprint match this activity globally. Halliburton works, innovates and invest where it matters most for our customers.\nAnd finally, Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers explicitly focuses on helping operators maximize returns and cash flow. This makes Halliburton uniquely relevant for this environment.\nOur 5 strategic priorities are clear and effective and will drive our behavior in this upcycle. First, we focus on profitable growth in our strong international franchise. Second, we maximize value and cash flow in North America. Third, we accelerate the deployment and integration of automation and digital technologies. Fourth, we drive increased capital efficiency in all parts of our business. And fifth, we actively participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. As demand for Halliburton services increases, both internationally and in North America, we will execute on our 5 strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders.\nAs I look across the international markets, I continue to believe our customers' international spend will increase by mid-teens this year. Here are some leading indicators. First, we started with revenues in the first quarter much higher compared to the same period of last year. Second, our completion tool order book increased 50% year-on-year in the first quarter, which represents work generally delivered within the current year. And third, we have a strong pipeline of new projects scheduled to start in the second half of this year, particularly in the Middle East.\nWe expect international activity to gain momentum in the second quarter, led by the Middle East and Latin America and further accelerate in the second half of the year. More importantly, our strong first quarter Drilling and Evaluation division margins demonstrate our focus on profitable international growth.\nBeyond the shift to short-cycle barrels already discussed, we expect this international up cycle to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton's international business is poised to benefit from it. Here's why. National oil companies and independents comprise a larger portion of the international customer set. As a result of divestitures in the last few years, many international assets now have new owners who require a more collaborative service provider to help unlock remaining reserves and maximize value.\nHalliburton's collaborative approach, broad technology portfolio, local expertise and reliable execution help customers achieve their efficiency and production objectives. Halliburton's execution of our technology road map has completely transformed our competitiveness in drilling and evaluation. We enter this upcycle with the best product portfolio in our history, and we see increased customer demand for our high-end technology and a recognition of its value.\nFor example, Halliburton recently deployed our new Strata Examiner Wireline Imaging Service for multiple customers in Norway and Morocco. Strata Examiner helped operators acquire more accurate well data in oil and synthetic-based muds, better evaluate production potential and save rig time with log-down capability and increased logging speed. Another example is the latest addition to our logging while drilling suite, the StrataStar azimuthal resistivity service for thin interbedded formations. Similar to our premium EarthStar service the StrataStar combines high fidelity downhole sensors with powerful digital inversion capabilities. Multiple customers in the Middle East, Latin America, U.S. and Canada use it for faster, more accurate reservoir characterization to precisely place wells in the most productive zones and maximize asset value.\nWe also see a slight uptick in offshore exploration activity albeit from a historically low base. Halliburton's increased competitiveness in drilling and evaluation resulted in a doubling of our contract win rate in global exploration work over the last 2 years and we expect to benefit from any additional growth in this higher-margin market.\nDifferent from prior cycles, Halliburton's investments in specialty chemicals and artificial lift create unique growth opportunities as we expand the international footprint of these businesses. Last month, I attended the opening of our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia. Multiple years in the making, this world-class facility establishes our chemicals manufacturing footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is our launch path for profitable growth in the specialty chemicals industry in the Middle East and beyond.\nThis quarter, it will start manufacturing products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our own product service lines.\nSeveral years ago, I described digitalization as one of the defining trends in our industry for this decade. Today, digital innovations permeate all segments of the oilfield services market. At Halliburton, our strategy to drive digital and automation creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies and cost savings. Here are some examples.\nOn an integrated drilling project in Southeast Asia, Halliburton deployed Well Construction 4.0, our approach to digital transformation of well construction. It improved the rate of penetration by about 40% on initial wells and reduced rig site personnel by 21%. On an integrated project in the Middle East, we combine data science, smart bits drilling automation and project management services for a more than 40% reduction in average well delivery time.\nWe also deploy our digital solutions to advance a sustainable energy future. In the first quarter, Energean hired Halliburton to assess the carbon storage potential of the Prinos Basin in Greece, who will use our DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to perform long-term ploom modeling, characterize the storage complex and create a conceptual development plan with performance modeling.\nWe expect to deliver steady, profitable growth in the international markets for the rest of this year. Increased activity and equipment tightness continued to sharpen our pricing discussions with customers. Pricing is increasing on current contract extensions. In the first quarter, the percentage of contract extensions exercised almost doubled compared to the same period last year as operators generally prefer to extend existing contracts rather than bid work in an inflationary market. Pricing is also increasing on new work.\nTurning to North America. We see market tightness across all service segments. In the first quarter, average U.S. rig count increased 14% sequentially and is up 62% year-on-year. Additionally, frac activity surged in March after winter weather and supply chain disruptions occurred earlier in the quarter. Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing fleet remains sold out and the overall market appears all but sold out for the second half of the year.\nThe market today presents several positive elements previously absent in North America, and they give me confidence in the continued strength of this market over the coming years. First, in the largest service segment in North America, the hydraulic fracturing market structure has improved. Today, the largest 4 pressure pumping companies account for about 2/3 of the market.\nSecond, I believe that poor service industry returns over many years in North America ultimately resulted in a closed-loop capital system because access to meaningful outside capital doesn't exist today, market participants must generate their own cash in order to reinvest and grow their businesses. Broad-based profitability improvements are required to fund growth, not just what appears to be good economics on a single incremental fleet.\nFinally, I see greater differentiation in hydraulic fracturing equipment types. In prior cycles, fleets were relatively the same. Today, all equipment is not created equal. Significant operational, environmental and pricing differences exist ranging from electric fleets at the top; dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel in the middle; and finally, Tier 2 diesel equipment at the bottom.\nWe have a terrific fleet composition. Halliburton is the leader in low emissions frac equipment. Our Zeus e-fleets have committed contracts, earn attractive returns and deliver improved performance. Another technology that sets Halliburton apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market is our SmartFleet Intelligent Fracturing System. Customers are adopting this groundbreaking technology, and it has moved from pilot to campaign mode. We are deploying it for multiple operators across different basins and expect a sixfold increase in the number of stages completed with SmartFleet this year.\nTightness in North America is not just in hydraulic fracturing equipment. It exists across the whole oil and gas value chain, in spare parts, engines, electronics and many other inputs that cost more and are sometimes not immediately available. While we generally pass these increased costs on to operators, we also have effective solutions that minimize this operational impact and provide reliable execution for our customers.\nFor example, our sophisticated supply chain organization responded by sourcing sand from Wisconsin when local mines were down in the Permian. In trucking, our collaboration with Vorto provides us with real-time information on the market clearing price for drivers and allows us to manage inflation and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time.\nYears of low pricing and low returns impacted the North American oilfield services sector and the larger supply chain that supports our industry. Sustainably improved pricing is required to avoid future supply chain disruptions and to invest in the equipment, people and technology necessary to deliver production growth. I believe our customers understand this.\nAgainst this backdrop, we see a long runway for ongoing net pricing improvement across all of our product service lines. In this recovery, Halliburton is focused on maximizing value in North America. For us, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle.\nLast quarter, I shared with you my view that North America customer spending would grow more than 25% year-on-year. Today, as I look at a combination of customer activity and inflation, my outlook has improved, and I now expect North America spending to increase by over 35% this year.\nWith respect to activity, over 60% of the U.S. land rig count sits with private companies and they keep growing, while public E&Ps remain committed to their activity plans. Activity and demand for our services are increasing, both internationally and in North America. With our unique value proposition, clearly defined strategic priorities and global presence, I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, solid free cash flow and industry-leading returns and outperform as this upcycle accelerates.\nNow I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance?\n\nLance Loeffler\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.\nLet me begin with a summary of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 24%. Adjusted operating income was $533 million, or a 44% increase compared to the operating income of $370 million in the first quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased activity across all regions and improved pricing in North America.\nIn the first quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $64 million. Of these, impairments and other charges totaled $22 million, including $16 million of receivables related to the write-off of all of our assets in Ukraine. The remainder of the charges totaled $42 million and was related to the redemption premium and unamortized expenses associated with the early retirement of $600 million of our 2025 senior notes.\nNow let me discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 26%, while operating income was $296 million or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in the Western Hemisphere, higher completion tool sales throughout the Western Hemisphere in the Middle East, increased cementing activity in Africa and Middle East Asia, and improved well intervention services in North America land and the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Europe and lower completion tool sales throughout Asia.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 22%, while operating income was $294 million or a 72% increase. These results were due to increased drilling-related services globally; improved wireline activity in North America land, Latin America and the Middle East; increased testing services internationally; and higher project management activity in Latin America, India and Oman. Partially offsetting these increases were lower project management activity in Iraq as well as lower fluid services in the Caribbean, Brunei and Mozambique.\nMoving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 37%. This increase was primarily driven by improved pressure pumping activity and drilling-related services in North America land, higher stimulation, artificial lift and drilling-related activity in Canada and higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico.\nTurning to Latin America. Revenue increased 22% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; increased well construction services in Colombia; higher completion tool sales in Guyana; improved project management activity in Ecuador and Colombia; increased testing services and wireline activity across the region; and increased artificial lift activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluid services in the Caribbean and lower project management and stimulation activity in Mexico.\nIn Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%. This improvement was primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Egypt, increased drilling-related activity in Azerbaijan, increased well intervention and testing services across the region, improved well construction services in West Africa, and higher completion tool sales and cementing activity in Angola. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the United Kingdom, reduced well construction services and completion tool sales in Norway and decreased fluid services in Mozambique.\nIn the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 17%, primarily resulting from improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, increased wireline activity and completion tool sales in the Middle East, and increased testing services across the region. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management activity in Iraq, lower completion tool sales throughout Asia, decreased fluid services in Brunei and lower stimulation activity in Bangladesh.\nOur corporate and other expense for the quarter totaled $57 million, and I expect that to serve as a good quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $107 million. I expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of a full quarter impact of our reduced debt balance.\nOur normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $189 million. Our expected CapEx spend for the full year remains at approximately $1 billion, and we anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year.\nOur first quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow was a use of cash of $50 million and $183 million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by investment in working capital, consistent with our strong activity growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we expect our cash flow to be back-end loaded for the year. We still expect to generate strong free cash flow for the remainder of 2022.\nFinally, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. Therefore, second quarter revenue is anticipated to grow low- to mid-single digits. As a result of the falloff of software sales, we expect D&E margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points.\nIn the Completions and Production division, activity is accelerating globally and scarcity will drive pricing in North America in the second quarter. As such, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid-teens and margins to improve 350 to 400 basis points.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThanks, Lance.\nLet me summarize what we've talked about today. We believe that this accelerating multiyear upcycle is different and more sustainable than prior cycles due to operators' focus on short-cycle barrels. Halliburton's strategic priorities are clear and effective and drive outperformance. Our technology portfolio and market presence mean that we are poised for profitable growth in the international markets. In the tight North America market, we remain focused on maximizing value and improving returns. And finally, I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in this up cycle.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2021 finished strong for Halliburton, and I'm excited about the accelerating upcycle as we enter 2022. We have an effective value proposition and benefit from increasing activity both in North America and international markets. At the same time, we see improving service pricing in both markets. Throughout this upcycle, I expect Halliburton to grow profitably, accelerate free cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet and increase cash returns to shareholders.\nBut first, I want to take a minute and recognize the men and women of Halliburton for their execution on every dimension of our business: safety, service quality and financial results. In spite of global complexity in 2021, you outperformed. So to all of our employees, thank you.\nI believe 2022 will be a strong year for our industry and especially for Halliburton. While global energy demand and economic growth demonstrated resilience, global energy supply has shown its fragility. The impact of several years of underinvestment in new production is now apparent, and the structural requirement to invest around the wellbore is crystal clear.\nWe see increasing customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value for Halliburton. Our customers demand reliable execution, dependable supply chains, effective technology and a collaborative service provider to maximize asset value, and this is at the core of Halliburton's unique value proposition.\nBut first, I'll highlight some of our 2021 accomplishments. We finished the year with total company revenue of $15.3 billion and operating income of $1.8 billion. Both of Halliburton's divisions grew revenue and margins this year. Our Completion and Production division finished the year with 15% operating margin driven by activity improvement despite inflationary pressures. We expect to build on this margin growth in 2022 as global activity and pricing improve.\nOur Drilling and Evaluation division margins remained firmly in double digits throughout 2021 and achieved full year margins of 12% for the first time since 2014. This is a good demonstration of our steady march forward, and we are not done.\nI am pleased with the trajectory of our international business. International revenue and operating income increased every quarter in 2021. In North America, Halliburton achieved 36% incrementals year-on-year as U.S. land activity rebounded and we maximized the value of our business. We announced our science-based emission reduction targets; added 11 new participating companies to Halliburton Labs; and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which highlights the top 10% most sustainable companies in each industry. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion and ended the year with $3 billion of cash on hand even after the retirement of $685 million of long-term debt in 2021.\nNext, let me share a few highlights from our fourth quarter performance. Total company revenue increased 11% and operating income grew 20% sequentially. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10% sequentially and operating income increased 8%, with completion tool sales showing the highest third to fourth quarter improvement in the last 15 years. Equally important, our current completion tool order book has more than doubled from a year ago, signaling strong growth and profitability again in 2022.\nOur Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 11%, which outperformed the global rig count growth for the quarter and delivered over 300 basis points of sequential margin improvement. International and North America revenue grew 11% and 10%, respectively, due to strong year-end sales and activity increases across all regions.\nBuilding on the strong foundation of disciplined execution, today, we announced 2 important strategic steps we are taking to further create value for our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2022. This action reflects our confidence in Halliburton's strong cash generation capacity.\nSecond, in order to accelerate debt retirement and strengthen our balance sheet, we are redeeming $600 million of our $1 billion in debt maturing in 2025. When these notes are redeemed in February, we will have retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. These steps demonstrate my confidence in our business, customers, employees and value proposition.\nAs I discussed with you on recent earnings calls, I expect the macro industry environment to remain supportive. And as we saw in 2021, the international and North America markets will continue their simultaneous growth. This is momentum that I have not seen in a long time. With this momentum, we plan to execute our unique strategic priorities, deliver profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate digital and automation deployment, improve capital efficiency and advance a sustainable energy future. Let's discuss how we plan to do this.\nFirst, internationally, our strategy is to deliver profitable growth. We allocate capital to the highest-return opportunities, which means we are selective on what we bid for and when. Our D&E margin performance in 2021 is a demonstration of this discipline.\nWe continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes asset value. In 2021, we brought to market over 50 new technologies, including our iStar Intelligent Formation evaluation platform and the next generation of our iCruise system for harsh drilling environments. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we expect to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up.\nWe have unique international growth opportunities in specialty chemicals and artificial lift. As Halliburton expands the international footprint of these businesses, we have a pipeline of opportunities that are longer cycle and should be margin-accretive. Halliburton's size, scale and sophisticated supply chain and HR teams reliably execute for our customers in the face of supply shortages and labor tightness.\nSecond, in the structurally smaller North American market, our strategy is to maximize cash flow, and it dictates how we approach our North America business. Strong cash flow starts with strong margins and Halliburton's margins are the best in class. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. These changes give us meaningful operating leverage as North American activity accelerates.\nWe consistently replace equipment as it wears out and avoid outsized recapitalization requirements. And we have the right type of equipment. We are the leaders in the low-emissions equipment segment. We believe this gives us a structural pricing advantage as operators are willing to pay a premium for differentiated, more environmentally friendly solutions.\nOur second generation Zeus electric fracturing technology is working in the field today and delivers results for a growing list of customers. Importantly, in addition to emissions reduction, electric fracturing technology provides unprecedented operational control and precision. For example, Zeus makes pumping rate adjustments at least 4x faster than a diesel pump, allowing us to respond to surface and subsurface changes more quickly than with a conventional frac spread and precisely execute the job design. We expect fully electric locations to become a larger share of the market.\nHalliburton has the right kit, including our Zeus electric pumping unit, the ExpressBlend blending system, the E-Winch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center to meet the market demand for lower-emitting fracturing operations. We develop differentiated technologies to focus around the wellbore. As the oil price and customer urgency increase, these technologies become more valuable to operators.\nFor example, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution helps customers optimize fracturing performance and maximize production. Several large operators will have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs this year. Additionally, SmartFleet delivers fully automated frac operations, which ensures more consistent fracture placement on every stage, improves cluster uniformity and manages offset frac hits.\nFinally, I want to highlight the importance of our well construction and production service lines. They each have unique competitive advantage and technology to maximize value in North America.\nThird, our strategy is to advance digitalization and automation in all aspects of our business. Our digital investments drive higher margins through customer purchases of software, smarter tools and ancillary products, and cost savings for Halliburton.\nLet me give you an example. Currently, 100% of Halliburton's drilling jobs run on a cloud-based, real-time system to deliver data and visualization to our customers around the world. Close to 60% of iCruise operations are fully automated, allowing for up to a 70% reduction in head count per rig. Automation alleviates health and safety concerns by removing personnel from rigs, accelerates service delivery improvements and reduces the environmental footprint of oil and gas operations.\nOur fourth strategic priority is to drive capital efficiency across the balance sheet. This positions Halliburton to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow as markets grow. We will optimize the working capital required to grow our business and maintain our CapEx in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Our business thrives in this range because of our research and development efforts and process changes. These allow us to build tools cheaper, lengthen their run life and move assets quicker to where they make the most money.\nOur final strategic priority is to advance a sustainable energy future. Our clean energy accelerator, Halliburton Labs, continues to add new participants. We help these early-stage companies achieve important scaling milestones and significantly increase their enterprise value. Through Halliburton Labs, we are actively participating in the clean energy space without committing shareholder capital.\nHalliburton will evolve as energy evolves, and we will add to our already expanding opportunities to participate as clean energy value chains mature. However, we will do so consistent with our capital allocation strategy and mindful of our commitment to deliver industry-leading returns and free cash flow generation. We will proceed with patience, discipline and resolve.\nNow let's review our fourth quarter 2021 performance and expectations for 2022. As OPEC+' spare capacity returns to normalized levels this year, we believe sufficient pent-up oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production and lead to increased activity. International activity accelerated in most markets in the second half of the year and finished strong in the fourth quarter with a 23% rig count increase year-on-year. All Halliburton regions grew revenue, led by Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa with both of our divisions contributing to the revenue and margin expansion.\nI'm excited about our future international growth. Despite typical first quarter seasonality, we are starting 2022 a lot higher than where we entered 2021. I expect our customers' international spend to increase by mid-teens this year. We anticipate projects in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America to attract the most investment with activity increases in Africa and Europe limited to a few markets.\nAsset owners are eager to reverse base production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. We expect that operators will focus on shorter-cycle production opportunities to meet increasing oil demand. This disproportionately benefits Halliburton as these short-cycle barrels require higher service intensity and spending directly focused on the wellbore as opposed to long-cycle infrastructure investments.\nIn 2022, we expect to deliver steady, profitable growth across the international markets. Our tender pipeline is strong. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. We plan to allocate our capital dollars to the opportunities that generate the highest return. Given the tool tightness that exists today in some product lines and geographies, we intend to strategically reallocate assets to drive improved utilization and returns. A tightening market focuses our ongoing pricing discussions with customers.\nWe see pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, including integrated contracts. Additionally, we have introduced pay-for-performance models, negotiated favorable terms and conditions and applied price escalation clauses. While large tenders remain competitive, we are consistent with our strategy to pursue profitable growth.\nTurning to North America. In 2021, the recovery in North America was faster and more pronounced than in the international markets. In the fourth quarter, U.S. land rig count increased 84% year-on-year, and drilling activity outpaced completions as operators prepared well inventory for 2022 programs. Completed stage count growth moderated slightly due to the holidays, sand supply tightness and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In the fourth quarter, we finished the planned upgrade of all fracturing fleets to the next-generation fluid end technology that extends the life of our equipment and helps reduce maintenance cost.\nWe expect a busy 2022 in North America. Given a strong commodity price environment, we anticipate North America customer spending to grow more than 25% year-on-year. We believe the highest increase will come from private operators. Public E&Ps will continue to prioritize returns while delivering production into a supportive market.\nIn North America, Halliburton uniquely benefits as the largest oilfield services provider in the largest oilfield services market in the world. We anticipate solid net pricing gains in North America throughout 2022. Here's why.\nThe North America completions market is approaching 90% utilization, and Halliburton is sold out. Pricing for our fracturing fleets is moving higher across the board, both for our market-leading low-emissions equipment and our Tier 4 diesel fleets. As a result, we expect to see over 30% incrementals in our hydraulic fracturing business in the first quarter. Anticipated demand growth for equipment provides a runway for us to increase pricing throughout the year.\nWe expect some market-wide operational efficiencies afforded by completing a backlog of DUCs in 2021 to reverse as frac fleets return to the usual mode of following drilling rigs. This will further increase the call on equipment as operators add rigs throughout the year.\nFinally, during the tendering season, we secured net pricing increases across several different nonfrac product service lines: drilling, cementing, fluids, drill bits and artificial lift. As activity accelerates, the market is seeing tightness related to trucking, labor, sand and other inputs. While we pass these increased costs on to operators, Halliburton has effective solutions that minimize the operational impact of this tightness and provide reliable execution for our customers.\nAs an example, in 2021, we expanded our collaboration with Vorto and now benefit from 5F, the largest integrated transportation platform in the oil and gas industry. This platform has several thousand drivers, hundreds of carriers and a chain of asset maintenance yards. It allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time.\nOur human resources team and systems effectively mitigate local labor tightness. We recruit nationally and hire, train and manage a commuter workforce that makes up to 80% of our personnel in some areas.\nThere is no doubt the much anticipated multiyear upcycle is now underway. North America production growth remains capped by operators' capital discipline, while meaningful international production growth is challenged by years of underinvestment. Energy demand has proven its resilience, fueled by pent-up economic growth and a global desire to return to normalcy. This is a fantastic set of conditions for Halliburton. And a strong commodity price environment with limited production growth options, operators turn to short-cycle barrels and increased spend around the wellbore.\nOur value proposition works. We have the right strategies for both international and North American markets. We are leaders in digital and automation, and we drive capital efficiency while advancing a sustainable energy future. I fully expect that Halliburton will accelerate cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet and increase cash returns to shareholders in this upcycle.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial results. Lance?\n\nLance Loeffler\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Halliburton Company\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nTotal company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 11%. Operating income was $550 million, a 20% increase compared to the adjusted operating income of $458 million in the third quarter. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end-of-year product and software sales.\nNow let me discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division. Revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $347 million or an 8% increase. These results were primarily driven by higher completion tool sales globally as well as increased pressure pumping services in North America land and the Middle East/Asia region. These improvements were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico; lower pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS and Asia; reduced well intervention services in Brazil; and decreased artificial lift activity in North America land.\nIn our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 11%, while operating income was $269 million or a 45% increase. These results were due to increased drilling-related services globally, wireline sales in Guyana, improved project management activity in Ecuador and India, increased wireline activity in the Middle East/Asia region, and higher software sales in Latin America and Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased project management activity and testing services in Mexico as well as lower drilling-related activity in Russia.\nMoving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 10%. This increase was primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity and drilling-related services in North America land in addition to higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with reduced artificial lift activity in North America land.\nTurning to Latin America. Revenue increased 7% sequentially. This improvement was driven by higher project management activity in Ecuador, increased drilling-related services in Mexico, increased activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, wireline sales in Guyana, and higher activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management and stimulation activity and testing services in Mexico.\nIn Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 8% sequentially. These results were partially driven by higher software and completion tool sales across the region, improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and Egypt, and increased well control activity in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Russia, reduced pipeline services and well construction activity in the United Kingdom, and decreased stimulation activity in the Congo.\nIn the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 16%, resulting from higher completion tool sales and wireline activity across the region, improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, higher software sales in Kuwait and China, improved project management activity in India, and increased stimulation activity throughout Asia. These increases were partially offset by reduced pipeline services in Asia, along with lower activity across multiple product service lines in Vietnam.\nNow I'd like to address some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $66 million, which was slightly higher than expected due to an increase in legal reserves. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be about $60 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $108 million, slightly lower than anticipated due to higher interest income from our cash balance.\nToday, we announced our decision to redeem $600 million of the 2025 senior notes using cash on hand. This action will reduce future cash interest expense and reflects our desire to continue reducing debt balances. As a result of the debt retirement in late February, our net interest expense should remain roughly flat in the first quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we recognized a noncash gain of approximately $500 million due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. This reversal is based on the improved market conditions and reflects our increased expectation to utilize these deferred tax assets going forward.\nOur normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 23%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2022 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately the same.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $316 million with our 2021 full year CapEx totaling approximately $800 million. In 2022, we intend to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $1 billion while remaining within our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. We believe that this level of spend will equip us well to execute on our strategic priorities and take advantage of the accelerating market recovery.\nTurning to cash flow. We generated nearly $700 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $3 billion in cash.\nI've spoken before about our ability to concurrently reduce debt and increase the return of cash to shareholders, and today, we put that into action. This is a great start to a longer-term goal of returning more cash to shareholders.\nNow let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which will mostly impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. However, we expect pricing recovery in North America to help offset these dynamics.\nAs a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue and margins to be essentially flat to the fourth quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the mid-single digits sequentially, while margins are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points.\nI'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Allen Miller\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Halliburton Company\n\nThanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, we see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity ramps up throughout the year.\nIn the critical North America market, we expect our business to grow and improve margins. We prioritize our investments to the highest-return opportunities and remain committed to capital efficiency.\nWe continue to play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. In 2022, I expect Halliburton to deliver margin expansion, industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow.\nAnd now let's open it up for questions."

Welcome to the Linde Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions].\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nAbi, thank you. Hello, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2025 third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Wendy's third quarter financial performance and outlook, after which, we will wrap up the Q&A.\nLet me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Once again, the third quarter has proven the strength and resilience of our model. EPS of $4.21 grew 7%. Operating cash flow grew 8% and and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow. The backlog remains at $10 billion, contractually securing long-term EPS growth while increasing our network density.\nDespite the challenging macroeconomic environment, Linde employees continue to generate shareholder value while maintaining industry-leading results across key metrics that matter most to our investors. This culture of ownership, deeply ingrained throughout our organization is a foundation of our performance culture. And it serves us well in both good times and bad.\nGiven the current economic uncertainty, I thought it would be helpful to provide you an overview of what we are seeing around the world. Slide 3 provides the end market trends for organic sales which include both price and volume. Starting with consumer-related end markets, which make up about 1/3 of global sales. Healthcare encompasses both institutional and home care sales, primarily for respiratory ailments.\nYou may recall last year, we proactively pruned certain parts of the U.S. home care portfolio. which laps by the end of this year. Going forward, I expect health care to remain a stable and steadily growing segment. Food and Beverage continues to grow low to mid-single digits, driven by a combination of consumption trends and innovative application technologies that enhance food quality and preservation.\nThis is a work horse of the portfolio that may not get a lot of the spotlight but it provides consistent growth and is remarkably resilient. Electronics at 9% of sales was the fastest-growing end market this quarter. Note, this 9% does not include an additional 2% of electronic sales in Taiwan through our nonconsolidated joint venture, which is also growing well.\nThe 6% growth we achieved is evenly split between on-site project start-ups and demand for processed gases and advanced materials. Growth was fueled primarily by higher chip production in Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. and some lower rent ships in China and Southeast Asia.\nWe observed increased fab activity in Q3, spurring merchant and packaged gas demand as well as new all side bidding opportunities, particularly for cutting-edge advanced nodes. I expect this end market to provide robust growth for some time and serve as an important part of our project backlog growth.\nTurning to industrial end markets, which account for about 2/3 of our sales. As many of you know, this is an area we've been cautious on for several quarters in a row. So recent macro trends have not been a surprise. Starting with metals and mining, which were slightly up, largely due to inflationary price increase, while base volumes were mostly negative. Metals trends were region-specific and also impacted by tariffs.\nChina is up well line benefits from supplying Tier 1 customers, but I believe the trends for Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills are considerably more stressed, but we do not supply that. U.S. been as bright spot for metals, not just production levels, but also new capacity opportunities as they've been supported by the new tariffs. Europe by contrast is the weakest as demand continues to drop led by weak industrial activity.\nWe've been supplying steel mills for many decades, and we have seen the cycles. We have confidence in the competitiveness of our customers, but also the opportunity to deploy our applications that enable our customers to either reduce energy consumption, debottleneck and enhance efficiency.\nChemicals and Energy are up 1%, driven by inflationary price increases. Overall, base volumes are down as chemicals is one of the most challenged end markets today. The U.S. and China saw flat volumes. India continues to see moderate growth. While the rest of the world is seeing volume decline as they adapt to trade policies and lower demand. Europe remains the weakest with continued broad-based demand challenges. Fixed payments are being made. So the profit impact for us is therefore limited.\nDespite the current challenges, I expect this cycle to rebound as all prior ones have, especially given our confidence in the cost position of our top-tier customer base. Manufacturing, which grew at 3% year-on-year was the fastest-growing industrial end market. I start with the Americas.\nWe are seeing solid volume growth, especially in the United States. We seem to have lapped some of the tariff concerns, and this has translated into a healthy uptick in manufacturing activity. In addition, I'm pleased with the momentum in our commercial space business. Growth has been strong as we remain the trusted supplier of fuel for rocket launches and satellite propulsion systems. This sector continues to present exciting opportunities for Linde as we invest in additional capacity.\nTurning to APAC. Manufacturing volumes are holding steady. China's numbers appear to be leveling off, while India remains on a strong growth trajectory. Europe, again, continues to face challenges with widespread softness in manufacturing activity.\nSummarizing these trends. Consumer markets are performing as one would expect. Pricing continues to track inflation. And despite some of the volume challenges from the ongoing industrial recession Linde is well positioned to supply as industrial activity and volumes recover. In other words, it's business as usual.\nFinally, more recently, I've heard some talk of a potential recession and the possibility of an economic contraction. As far as I'm concerned, we've been in an industrial recession for more than 2 years. And here at Linde, we've taken proactive steps while navigating contractions across several industrial end markets. We've been making our model recession resistant for many years now, stressing on productivity and efficiency within our business, focusing on targeted high-quality growth while maintaining disciplined capital management.\nOur operating model is designed to plan for the worst and be ready to capitalize on opportunities as they come. When things get tough, there is no group in the world that rather have in my corner, the [ Destiny ] team.\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.\n\nMatthew J. White\n\nExecutive Vice Presiden & Chief Financial Officer, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Third quarter results can be found on Slide 4. Sales of $8.6 billion were up 3% from last year and 1% sequentially. The Recent weakness in the U.S. dollar led to a currency tailwind of 1%. Tuck-in acquisitions in Americas and APAC added another 1% and An engineering impact decreased 1% from project timing.\nExcluding these items, year-over-year underlying sales increased 2%. Price increases of 2% were broad-based and aligned with globally weighted inflation except for helium, which continues to experience price pressure from excess supply. Overall volumes were flat as contribution from the project backlog was offset by weaker base volumes driven primarily by European industrial customers.\nAs Sanjiv mentioned, the weaker industrial activity was not a surprise as trends mostly followed our guidance expectations. Underlying sales were flat sequentially and as seasonal increases in APAC were offset by seasonal decreases in EMEA. Note, we had a supplier settlement in the U.S. home care business broken into 2 separate payments to Linde. The majority was paid Q3 2024, as disclosed in the 10-Q.\nWhile a final smaller payment was received in the second quarter 2025. The payments were covered prior excessive costs and resulted in a current quarter operating profit headwind of approximately 2% or 40 basis points versus last year, and 1% or 20 basis points sequentially. Aside from this, profit growth was primarily driven by price increases.\nEPS of $4.21 increased 7% or 4% more than operating profit primarily from a lower share count and tax rate. While the share count is part of our ongoing repurchase program, the tax rate relates to favorable timing versus the upcoming fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate full year ETR to be in the mid- to high 23% range, which is similar to 2024.\nSlide 5 provides an update on capital management. Operating cash flow increased sequentially to $2.9 billion, or 8% over prior year. Second half operating cash flow is seasonally higher. So I expect a similar level for the fourth quarter. Overall, despite economic headwinds, the bar chart validates our resiliency through significant free cash flow generation.\nTo the right, you can see how we deployed year-to-date capital with $4.2 billion invested into the business using our disciplined investment criteria and $5.3 billion return to shareholders. We have an underleveraged balance sheet with significant access to low-cost capital. So we're well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.\nI'll wrap up with a guidance update on Slide 6. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is $4.10 to $4.20. And or 3% to 6% growth. While this assumes a 2% FX tailwind, it also assumes an approximate 2% tax rate headwind, so these 2 mostly offset. As mentioned earlier, third quarter tax rate was slightly lower than the run rate, but we anticipate fourth quarter to be higher.\nThere aren't any structural reasons rather just timing effects. It's possible there could be upside to this tax rate estimate, but time will tell. Excluding these 2 items, underlying EPS growth is holding in the mid-single-digit range as we maintain the assumption of base volume contraction at the top end of guidance, similar to last quarter. The quarter guidance rolls up to a full year range of $16.35 to $16.45 or 5% to 6% growth against the challenging macro backdrop.\nIn summary, we remain cautious on the outlook. It's difficult to identify near-term catalysts, which could materially improve industrial activity. for the remainder of 2025. And while we may take this prudent view, it does not negate our ability to generate shareholder value. Over the last 2 years, the global economy experienced recessionary industrial conditions with restrained capital activity. Linde has grown operating cash and EPS, mid- to high single digits while contractually securing a record high-quality project backlog.\nLooking ahead, if conditions worsen, we're prepared to take appropriate mitigating actions. And when things recover, we're well positioned to capitalize. Either way, we won't spend time predicting the future, but rather focusing on the actions to shape it.\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Linde Q2 2025 earnings call and webcast. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nI appreciate it, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending to our 2025 Q2 earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer, Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website www.linde.com in the investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides, and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's Q2 financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. So now let me turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning everyone. I'd like to thank our Linde employees for once again delivering solid results.\nEPS of $4.09 and operating margin of 30.1% both represent all-time quarterly highs against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment. Operating cash flows grew 15% and ROC of 25.1% continues to comfortably lead the industry, and these results are underpinned by a healthy balance sheet that ensures access to low-cost capital.\nOverall, Q2 was a successful quarter which Matt will provide some more further details. Before that I'd like to review one of my top priorities which is to ensure future growth for Linde. Slide three highlights the Sale-of-Gas project backlog, which is one key element of that future growth. One cannot discuss project backlog without first aligning on definition of what is included. Unlike others in the industry, Linde's definition has been clear and consistent with the most disciplined criteria. Inclusion in Linde's project backlog requires incremental growth secured by contractual fixed fees with high quality customers. Contract renewals, plants without customer commitments, or LOIs are not included in our backlog. It's important to make this distinction because backlogs are simply not comparable within the industry.\nWhile many like to tout the overall size of the backlog, it's the turnover of the backlog which is one of the most important metrics, which actually can be seen in the center graphic represented by wins and startups.\nIn a little over four years, the Sale-of-Gas backlog has approximately doubled from $3.6 billion to $7.1 billion. The same is true for the number of projects, moving from 33 projects to 70 projects. During this time, we added $9.2 billion of new projects and, more importantly, started up $5.7 billion of these wins. This represents more than 150% backlog turnover in four and a half years. So, while I'm pleased to see the Sale-of-Gas current backlog at record levels, I'm equally encouraged by the accelerated turnover from timely execution and strong contracts. Of this $7.1 billion backlog, almost 3/4 are in the Americas, mainly the US, for future plants serving the electronics end market and clean energy. To the right, you will see some of the high-quality customers that make up the majority of this backlog.\nOne recent add is the Blue Point Project, which is a JV between CF Industries, JERA, and Mitsui, that will produce low-carbon ammonia in Louisiana. We're proud to have been selected as their industrial gas partner due to the capability and track record of our US Gulf Coast team. The addition of this facility will help further build out supply density in a fast-growing region in the US. Furthermore, this win represents a third large clean energy contract signing, bringing the total to approximately $5 billion, which validates that the right low-carbon projects will continue to reach FID and execute contracts. Also, not included in the slide is a Sale-of-Plant backlog, which today stands at $3.2 billion and typically converts one-to-one to sales over a three-year cycle.\nNow it's important to note that while we've made nice strides with the backlog, it does not represent all investments for future growth. We actually spend over $1 billion in CapEx annually for what we call base volume growth. Decisions for making these investments follow the same process as the backlog and require a consistent risk vs return criteria. They're just missing one or two key requirements to be classified as backlog. Most base growth CapEx supports packaged and merchant supply modes and is critical to further developing network density. Now, small onsites, an important supply bridge from merchant to onsite, can also be included as base CapEx when individual plant CapEx is less than $5 million.\nOne recent base growth addition includes a Southeastern US merchant investment in support of space launches, a sector that continues to offer attractive growth opportunities. While these wins are contractual commitment by customers, the lack of guaranteed fixed fees precludes eligibility in the backlog. Finally, I'd be remiss not to mention the role of small tuck-in acquisitions can play for sustained high quality growth. While I don't expect this number to be an overly large driver, it can consistently deliver an annual 1% or 2% bottom line improvement from both acquired profits and self-help synergies. For the Q2 you can see the 1% top line increase from US and APAC bolt-on acquisitions, mostly in packaged gases.\nOverall, despite the unfavorable economic backdrop, we are forging an independent path to growth. This comes not only from a high quality disciplined project backlog, but also incremental base CapEx investments and roll up acquisitions. I'm highly confident in the Linde team's ability to not only win more than our fair share of high quality opportunities, but also to execute them as promised to deliver value for both customers and shareholders. Simply stated, I continue to be bullish on industrial gases as a critical foundation in making our world more productive, and I'm certain Linde will remain the undisputed leader in this effort. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nThanks Sanjiv. Slide four provides a summary of Q2 results.\nSales of $8.5 billion increased 3% over prior year, and 5% sequentially year-over-year. FX headwinds abated as we saw a 3% sequential improvement from broad-based weakening of the US dollar. Cost pass-through trends were driven by energy fluctuations but have no impact on profit. As Sanjiv mentioned, acquisitions lifted sales 1% over prior year from synergistic deals in the US and APAC.\nExcluding these items, underlying sales grew 1% over prior year and 3% sequentially. Broad-based price increases continue to track with globally weighted inflation, except for helium and China.\nVolumes are down 1% from last year as weaker base volumes, primarily in EMEA, more than offset contribution from the project backlog. As mentioned in prior calls, much of this decline stems from existing contractual customers using less gas in their operations, so any recovery would be immediately beneficial. While volumes did increase 2% sequentially from seasonal effects, the core trend remained somewhat stagnant.\nOperating profit at $2.6 billion increased 6% over prior year. The operating margin of 30.1% increased 80 basis points or 100 basis points when excluding the effect of cost pass-through. EPS of $4.09 also increased 6% from prior year as a lower share count was mostly offset by a higher effective tax rate.\nDespite the base volume headwinds, business quality continues to improve from self help actions. Further support of this quality can be seen in operating cash flow growth of 15% as well as a healthy ROC exceeding 25%.\nMore details in capital management can be found on slide five. The operating cash flow trend shows sequential stability in the first half of this year, consistent with our commentary from last quarter. Recall that the first half of the year is seasonally weaker due to timing of certain cash impacts like taxes, interest, and incentive compensation. I expect a step up for the back half like what we experienced last year.\nBase CapEx is stable, which has enabled healthy levels of cash flow available for shareholder returns, M&A, and project investments. The pie chart represents a steady and disciplined capital allocation policy which deployed almost $6.5 billion year-to-date. Of this, $2.8 billion comprises investments that met our risk-reward criteria, an increase of 20% over last year.\nEqually important is our ability to consistently access low cost capital. This quarter we issued bonds of half a billion Swiss francs with an average yield less than 1%. Ability to raise cost-effective capital will continue to be a key component of shareholder value creation, especially as we see greater discrepancy across interest rate policies.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on slide six. For Q3, we're providing a guidance range of $4.10 to 4.20 or 4% to 7 above last year. This includes an assumed 1% currency tailwind, which would be the first quarterly FX benefit since late 2023.\nWhile the FX assumption improved from our prior guidance level, we mostly offset that with a more negative assumption of the economy. As the top end now assumes economic contraction. During Q2, we were able to capture the full FX upside on top of meeting the original expectation.\nHowever, the currency volatility and general economic uncertainty don't give us enough confidence to raise the outlook at this time. Rest assured, we'll strive to outperform this projection, but time will tell if we're being too conservative or not.\nFor the full year, we simply approached it the same way as the Q3, updated the improved FX but offset with an assumption of a contracting economy at the top end of the range. This resulted in a new range of $16.30 to 16.50 or 5% to 6 growth, including a 1% currency tailwind. The last time we saw a full year currency tailwind was 2021, so I believe it's appropriate to remain guarded.\nIn summary, the EPS algorithm remains intact. Linde employees continue to manage what's within their control to deliver value, but we know there's always room to improve. The current negative volume headwinds are a function of contractual customers taking less gas. Due to the economic uncertainty between internal initiatives and industrial recovery, I expect this level to improve like it always has.\nWhen that happens, coupled with the self-help growth initiatives that Sanjiv laid out, I'm confident Linde will return to the double-digit EPS growth that our owners have become accustomed to. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one a second time. If you're called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one if you would like to join the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Good morning guys. Congrats on a really good quarter. We're hearing a lot of different things from the companies in this space over the last week about just where business is globally, whether it's the tariffs and stuff like that. So could you take some time and just go geographically and by end markets, kind of what you're seeing and what you expect to see in the back half of the year?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Duffy. That's a good place to start. So why not do just that. Walk you around the world and share some insights. I'll start off here in the Americas, and I'm expecting volumes to be flat, maybe very slightly up, led essentially by growth in the resilient end market, but being partly offset by softer industrial sector. I have to say I remain positive on the US market. In Q2, we saw volume move in line with slightly positive IP numbers that were published earlier this week. Year-on-year, volumes were up for metals and mining, chemicals, energy, food and beverage electronics, while manufacturing showed a slight decline. Now, sitting in manufacturing is our commercial space market, which continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity. And Linde, of course, is well positioned in that space.\nThe opportunity to supply fuels for rocket launches, propulsion systems for placing satellites into orbits. It's fueling double-digit growth for Linde in that particular market or end market. And not only do we supply the leading and probably the most well-known company for space launches, but also working with many others who are looking to scale up and we expect to see that growth continue. So our recent announcement regarding the new investment in Texas and Florida is likely the first of many that you'll see. And again, we're trying to see how we take this business globally and in doing that are finding opportunities in Europe that are starting to look attractive as well.\nSo that's really Americas for you. With a lot of confidence in the US market, if you will, from that excitement of space. I have to bring you down to some ground reality when I talk about Europe. So Europe is expected to continue.\nsee softening in demand, led primarily by Western Europe. Any growth in the resilient end markets will be more than offset by decline in the industrial sector across metals, manufacturing, chemicals, and energy, all with volumes lower than last year. So in the short term, Europe has several challenges to get their economy back on their feet. I currently don't see any catalyst for economic improvement this year. Volumes therefore likely to be negative in the second half. I think it's going to be driven almost entirely by the industrial sector. Our team in Europe is doing all they can to manage through this economic environment, working on levers that they know and are in control of, such as price, productivity, cost actions. Of course you can see that reflected in the double-digit EBIT growth that they were able to provide in the quarter.\nBut looking ahead into the rest of the year, I'm not feeling any level of confidence that you're going to see improvement. If anything, you're going to see a likely decline continue there.\nIf I move on to Asia, I'll start with China maybe and just tell you China remains a mixed bag. You've heard me say this in previous calls. I expect China to remain flat for the year, and that continues to be our expectation. There is, you know, EVs, batteries, and electronics, end markets that will continue to grow, but that will be more than offset by much weaker metals and chemicals for the remainder of the year.\nIndustrial activity in Australia is seeing declines which are similar to Europe almost across all industrial sectors, really a reflection of the level of industrial activity in the country. Again, the Linde team there is busy executing their self-help actions which will show results at the back end of the year and beyond. Now the bright spot in APAC remains India with merchant volumes growing in their teens and a healthy opportunity pipeline for new investments. This is unfortunately offset by declines in the ASEAN countries. South Korea, the other main market in APAC, mainly driven by electronics and market, is also expected to see some growth.\nSo all in, I'd say when you wrap it all up for APAC, it's probably going to be just balanced or flat volumes for the year. That essentially is how we are seeing the market. I think the summary is resilient. End markets continue to have low to mid single digit growth but more than offset by the industrial sector, largely across the board with particular negativity coming out of EMEA.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning, Sanjiv, your price mix has been very stable over a number of years. Do you see any risk to not getting future price increases given the weak macro we're now in? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo David, I've often quoted that over the last 25 years Praxair Linde has always achieved positive pricing.\nBe it through economic cycles which are up or down. I think I'd say to you that remains the expectation going forward as well. A great proxy for our pricing is globally weighted CPI. You should see us track to that as we do at the moment. I guess when I look at pricing today and you can see the numbers as we provided in the deck, you'll see that pricing across all countries is actually pursuing that. In line with that globally weighted CPI, there is an exception, China which sits in APAC, which is got some challenges, particularly around helium pricing where we are seeing high single digit kind of price declines and some rare gases as well, and a little bit more pressure on China pricing generally. Beyond that, every other country is tracking in line with our expectations.\nSo I do not see any reason why we would not see positive pricing going forward. I've said this many times in the past, David. That's the way we create value for the customer, and the fact that we are a small sliver of their cost stack. I think that balance always works in our favor when we have a conversation on pricing.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask on margins, particularly in the Americas where margins were flat year-over-year, but you did have positive price and volume. But in some of the other segments, you had margin expansion year-over-year with maybe not as robust volume and price. Is that a function of the business mix in the quarter in the Americas, or is there something else going on?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nI'll let Matt respond to that, then I'll add a couple of comments at the end.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nHey, Vince, I'll start with any time you look at quarters, you can always have some noise and some bumpiness. I mean, we always tend to see that one in the quarters. For me, the most important thing is how you're tracking full year and year-to-date. That being said, you're going to have some mix in there, primarily with some of the home care. I'd say, you know, that might be a little bit of an impact. We feel quite good at the almost 32% margins we're tracking. We clearly see more room to improve, and we expect to improve that further. I wouldn't look very far into a single quarter at this point, and I don't think there's anything really of concern on a go forward in my basis.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Matt. I think you've actually covered it all. All I'd say is the expectation of margin expansion is something that we have laid out. You know, that 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion is how you should be thinking about the margins across all the segments.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP. Your line is open.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nSenior Analyst, BNP\n\nYes, good morning guys. I was wondering if you could talk about the appetite on your projects from customers. Given the macro backdrop that you are indicating, is there any risk of slowdown or slippage on intake so that your backlog may finish the year below $7 billion? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nLaurent, I said this in the last call, as I recall, my expectation remains that we will end the year with a backlog with a seven handle on it. This is despite the fact that we will start up another $1 billion of the investments that are currently sitting in our backlog in the second half of this year. Most of that will start ramping up towards the back end. You know, my view remains, and our business is currently, you know, supporting and giving me confidence that there is enough opportunity pipeline on projects that we're currently working on that we will be able to bring home a billion to get that backlog to $7 billion+.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nSenior Analyst, BNP\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Both you and Air Products had very strong EBIT growth in Europe. I think for both of you it was double digits, which was a step up. Did something happen in Europe to the industry in general? Was it a function of currency? Was it a function of other factors? Secondly.\nYour competitors in Allentown also said that the helium penalty to them was $0.55 or $0.60 a share as they estimate it for 2025. When you heard that number, did you say, oh, that makes sense, you know, that's a comparable, sort of comparable to what we're experiencing, or do you have a different experience if you are quantifying it?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nJeff, I'll let Matt talk about the EBIT growth, and then I'll give you a comment on helium.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, Jeff, I mean just using our table in the back with EMEA, clearly FX is part of that, right? You've got a 4% component of our 11% growth. Obviously, the euro has strengthened, the sterling has strengthened, so that's definitely helping. On top of that, you know, we continue to have pricing opportunities, we continue to have productivity opportunities. While the volume is negative, a large portion of that are with the on site contracts, which are heavy volume effect, but they tend not to be overly impactful to the operating profit given the fixed fee structure.\nThat's kind of the makeup that we have. Strong contracts, we continue to price to inflation, we have a lot of productivity initiatives, and we're getting a fairly nice tailwind on the FX. The combination of all that is giving us the double-digit OP growth despite some of the underlying macro challenges that you see. You know, clearly when we lap that and that stabilizes, that should give us some opportunity. At this stage, we're not banking on that and we're not guiding that. We're just kind of expecting a continuation of the same.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nOn helium, Jeff, you know, I'd say to you, as you're aware of course, that our exposure on helium is very different and much smaller than our friends you referred to earlier. What I say to you, the trends I see in helium year-to-date are helium volumes are flat, we have not seen a decline, and yes, pricing is down high single digit, and that's really just a function of the oversupply in the market, particularly around Asia, and maybe a little bit of cooling off in demand on the electronic side of things. Our expectation remains that helium supply will be long.\nYou would have seen our recent announcement that we are putting a 3 billion cu ft helium cavern in, and that really is around making sure that we are optimizing the sourcing end of things, giving ourselves more flexibility with the cavern to ensure that we have a plan in place that addresses the sourcing cost issues associated with that, and creates productivity benefit out of that sourcing. You know, I think, Stan, I think we do not really see a concern, and again, as I have said before, not, you know, it is, it is a, it is not a significant exposure for us.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nMatthew DeYoe\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I just wanted to dig in on Europe a bit. I guess first, if we decelerate again next year, would you still feel the volumes hit your on site, or are customers kind of largely at the low end of their commitments? Then just longer term, right, we have this deindustrialization of Europe. We're probably in the early innings of just chemical plant closures. I would suspect other industrial plant closures. I know you've got contracts here, right, but there's merchant, there's packaged. Let's, can we just hash out what this looks like across the top line for you as you look out, you know, two years, three years? Is Europe just going to be a -2%, -5% for you, or, you know, how do you manage what might be loss of, loss of density on closures?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nMatt, good question. On Europe, and clearly, as you can see, we remain bearish on Europe, and it's reflected in our guidance as well. That is a view for the short term. I'd say to you we are both cautious and conservative around our expectations from Europe. I said before in my commentary that I do not see a catalyst for that fundamentally changing in the near term now.\nFor the quarter, as you saw, the impact did come through. The general macro environment that affects the merchant and packaged side of the business from various end markets, but in particular manufacturing and a little bit of chemicals and metals, led to that negative volume decline that we showed, exacerbated of course by the on site volume decline that you just mentioned. That's what kind of came through, as you know. Well, on the on site, the contracts do protect us well. Really, the question I ask every month is for customers who are below and top on those contracts for on site, are they paying up? That is a critical assessment that we make. You know what, every customer is paying up. Those signals look good. The longer term is the question that you're also referring to.\nI have been bearish on the long term, but I'm going to give you a couple of perspectives which are kind of suggesting that you will see some potential change happen. I'm going to start off by a conversation on Germany. As you're aware, Matt, Germany has made this extraordinary commitment to investing EUR 1 trillion over the next 10 years in defense and build out of infrastructure.\nThat's a very significant industrial stimulus to the German economy. While you debate the reasons, the reality is it'll have an impact and will uplift both Germany, but also more broadly because supply chains are integrated across a slightly broader Western European Region.\nYou will feel that that impact comes through somewhere else as well. While in the short term we are seeing some of these challenges reflect in the chemical industry in particular, the longer term view, which I think is expected to start showing some initial signals, send some initial signals over the next couple of years, both from an increased level of infrastructure spend and defense spend, I think will be an important part in how we look at the long term view on Europe. There's one other thing which I want to just cover up briefly, which is on Eastern Europe, and this relates to conversations around Ukraine ReBuild. Now, I recognize we need to take that with a pinch of salt, just given everything that we're reading in the newspapers at the moment.\nThe reality is at some stage there will be a resolution of sorts, and that will result in potentially moving the Ukraine ReBuild forward. Large numbers being thrown around. I take them with, again, a fairly large pinch of salt. We have operated in Ukraine over the last three years. We continue to supply steel mills, medical facilities, etc., with product even today. We are pretty strongly positioned for any recovery that happens in Ukraine, not just for the Ukrainian business, which by all standards is on the smaller end, but by the infrastructure and footprint we hold in Eastern Europe broadly, which is a very strong footprint supporting whatever happens in Ukraine.\nThose two developments, I would say, Matt, are going to dictate how the longer term development in Europe is going to look like. Again, we'll have to wait and watch how that plays out. I obviously can say with high degree of confidence that Germany will go through that recovery in the foreseeable future. Ukraine, we'll have to just see when that happens.\n\nMatthew DeYoe\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning guys. Nice quarter. Just wanted to dig into the space a little bit. The recent agreement to merchant contract, as I recall. When do you think? When do you think these will convert into an on-site. Maybe frame up the growth potential, since we're sort of in an early phase of the development for that industry.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSure, Mike, great question. I said in my commentary earlier on describing my walk around the world that I do see space as a very attractive opportunity for growth, and the fact that Linde has been so well positioned, particularly in the US, with a history of more than five decades of supporting space development and more recently significant rocket launches, our two new investments are going to significantly spur that growth momentum. Now, having said that, let me give you a couple of data points just to help you kind of frame the growth potential that you were asking about. Over the last three years or so, we've seen our supplies into space and our revenue generated from that commercial space segment almost quadruple.\nWe today supply, I would say, more than four out of five launches that happen in the US.\nThe investments we are making in the infrastructure through the air separation plants, the distribution equipment, because much of this liquid is carried in and out using tankers, hydrogen production related infrastructure, you know, all of those, you know, by the end of the next couple of, couple three years, we would have invested just under $1 billion in building this infrastructure to support the space ecosystem going forward. I also mentioned that I see not just one, probably the most prominent launch company, I may not name them, but I know you'll know who they are, who have a prolific number of launches. Actually, we're seeing that spread and many other companies in that space now scaling up and looking at future programs as well. You know, I see that opportunity pipeline for growth being very, very attractive.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nWe have strong customer commitments, Mike. Just to make the point on on site vs merchant, the critical factor here is you have a strong customer commitment, and we have strong long-term customer commitments. It's just a commercial structure that doesn't allow us to classify that. As you know, we have a very disciplined and rigorous, you know, definition of backlog that I spoke to earlier. We just don't put them in the backlog for that reason, but the customer commitments are there, and they are over long term.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and nice results in a tough environment. Just wanted to dig a little bit more into the Sale-of-Gas project backlog, and in particular just get some color as to whether you see the return profile of those projects having improved over the last few years as that backlog has built up. It seems like, you know, with one of your competitors maybe focused in other areas, the opportunity set might be, you know, might be higher for you, just given there's maybe less competition for that. I guess, is that a fair way to think about it, or maybe you can add some color to it.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSure. The Sale-of-Gas backlog and every individual project that sits in there, all 70 of them, John, have gone through the rigorous process of being assessed at our investment committees against that investment criteria that we set out. Not only do we go through that process with some rigor, and if they've met the investment criteria, they obviously get approved and go into the backlog. The return profile hasn't moved significantly because the risk return equation has to play out based on the investment criteria that we have. I feel pretty good about the return profile that we have. An equally important portion of that return profile is how well you execute. The point I made earlier on in my prepared remarks around the turnover of the backlog is absolutely critical.\nFor an industrial gas company, it is very important to be able to execute them in a timely manner, to have a strong contractual position to ensure that you're monetizing that project and creating the returns that were promised, you know, when they were presented to the investment committee. I feel really good about the capabilities that we have within Linde, both on the engineering side, our team does a phenomenal job over there, and on the gas side where we do some great contracting and work closely with customers. That's really what's reflected in that return profile, which you then see as we start these projects up, come back, and reflect in the EPS growth that we commit out of these decisions that we make. I feel good about that.\nI'll give you one of the data points since you asked about how that competitive kind of environment looks. Juan actually did a really nice study a couple of years ago which looked back and said if you think about the competitive dynamics when you're bidding out these projects, about half the time the decision is a make or buy decision. As you know, our customers are sophisticated, they will make a make or buy decision. Of course, if there are projects where, you know, we have an interest, we are usually able to get that converted into a Sale-of-Gas project because we can show the benefits, and, you know, the benefits of the reliability, safe delivery of product coming with the benefit of network density. I think that's a very compelling case for the customers. About half those projects are make or buy.\nAbout 1/3 of the projects are where you see one of the competitor in the frame, and the rest, you know, you see multiple competitors. We tend to be very selective about projects in what's left over. You know, from our perspective, that hasn't changed. That analysis is still relevant. I think we, you know, obviously have to be, have to have a compelling proposition for our customers when they look at it, for them to move over.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Thanks very much for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious on the electronics outlook from here. It seems year-on-year sequential growth is down slightly. How much of this is helium pricing? Or maybe there was some modest pull. Forward in positioning in Q1. How would you characterize the shape of volume and new project starts for the balance of the year?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Patrick. Let me just start off by making sure that this is understood. Well, the industrial gases sales to the electronics end market grew both year-on-year and sequentially. The drop that you see in the end market slide that we have in the tech is all driven by our Advanced Materials business that sits in the global other segment, which provides electronics targets to some of these electronics customers. The instance over here was destocking happening with one of the larger customers, and that's going to correct itself in the second half. Really no concerns there. Just to clarify what the Advanced Materials Group is doing over here. Essentially, the Advanced Materials Group.\nDevelops and builds, manufactures precious metal targets which are used in the chip making process to deposit a thin film of materials onto the semiconductor wafer. The process called sputtering, what happens is we provide high energy particles bombarding the target that's been set up. What it does is it ejects these atoms to then provide a coating, a very thin level of coating on the wafer, forming layers for components like transistors, interconnects, etc. All of this is about putting very precise material deposition on the integrated circuitry. That's what sits in that Advanced Materials business, which is the reason why you see that slightly negative. Now as far as electronics outlook is concerned, my expectation remains that we have a very healthy not expectation.\nThe fact remains that we have a healthy pipeline of projects that are going to come up in the next 12 months or so, and we will obviously be participating. As you would expect from Linde, we're winning more than our fair share of those projects. The outlook for both new projects, as well as startups, remains on track with the backlog that we've just shown you.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you. The Economist magazine this week has a story on what's called Greenhushing. Your backlog, you said, is going to grow. The point of the story was that companies are still going forward with their energy transition investments. They just don't talk about it as much. It's not making the headlines. Two or three years from now, do you think energy transition will be still as big a percentage of your backlog? Based on what you're currently talking to customers about, are they actually pulling away? We don't hear a lot of companies talking about their energy transition programs anymore.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nWe recognize that customers will continue to need to decarbonize their operations. I expect the demand for low carbon products to continue to grow over time. It's just the hype and the euphoria has gone away, and reality is sunk in. That reality is a more stable, economically viable set of projects which will go to FID and get contracted. Those are the kinds of projects. Look, you know, at the risk of saying I told you so, we've said this for the last, I don't know, three years. None of this should come as a surprise to you or anyone else who's been on these earnings calls because we've said, look, it's unrealistic to expect this green hydrogen to get up to a point where it's at scale, it's cost competitive, and it actually adds and creates value.\nWe've always said that that's probably a five to seven year window for the technology to mature, and then you'll see the commercials play out. I'm not surprised by this article. The reality is low carbon alternatives, which is low carbon hydrogen, otherwise known as blue hydrogen, or low carbon ammonia, or products of that ilk, will still have a demand in the marketplace. We see solid projects with good economic cases, supported further by incentives such as the 45Q, remain around, and we are developing a number of those even today while we execute a number of those around the world as well. My view is I think this trend is not going to stop. There is, you know, increasingly an economic case for it. Good projects which create that economic value will still.\nSee progress and move to FID and get contract.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. I wanted to ask, just coming back to the guidance assumptions around things. Linde's approach has been we're seeing the market like X, and we're forecasting X. It seems like in this case we're seeing the volumes down 1%, and now your forecast is maybe at the midpoint, down 2%, something like that. I'd just be curious. Obviously, it's a weak market. No one's expecting anything incredibly exciting here. Are you seeing anything either in June, July trends that would say to you that there is weakening and that's more of a correct way to think about it, or is this just added conservatism for everything we don't know about FX included? Thanks.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nHey Josh, it's Matt. I think we'll start with, you know, the volumes to your point. They're down 1% on the quarter, but the base volumes are down 2%. When we think about sort of our economic projection, we're really talking to the base volumes because the backlog is pretty much on autopilot, right? That's contractual. That is independent of any macro view. Starting with the -2% on the base volumes that occurred this quarter, to your point, the current guide on the top end is assuming that 2% year-over-year continues out for the back half. While the year-over-year assumption in the top half is being held consistent, last year the comps got a little easier, so it does imply a little worsening on a sequential basis. We'll see if that happens.\nWhen I think about it in combination, clearly FX rates improved, meaning the dollar weakened, given the uncertainty, given some of the flight to different currencies. It is interrelated. I think from this perspective, maybe you see currency, maybe you see the dollar strengthen a bit, things stabilize, maybe you see the opposite. At this point I think about them in combination and we'll have to see how it plays out. The top end pretty much has about a 2% base volume negative assumption, which is probably double the effect on EPS for the remainder of the year. We're going to do what we can to do better than that. That's what we laid out. This is what we set down and we'll have to see how it plays out.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you and good morning. Matt, what impact, if any, does the passage of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act have? Maybe internally for Linde, or appreciate any thoughts you may have on any early feedback from your customer base as to potential stimulus in the Americas, and just wondering if it has any meaningful impact at all on your 2025 guide or how you're thinking conceptually about the 2026 outlook.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nSure. I think when we start thinking about the Bill, I'll stick mostly to the taxes right now.\nWhat it mainly did was make permanent a lot of the existing tax policy that we were operating under since the 2017 Act. That in of itself, I think, is positive in that it gives more confidence looking ahead. When you think about the US tax policy, it had a lot of temporary items. Those temporary items can be difficult to do long term planning and long term investments in the country because of the uncertainty whether those temporary items will continue or not. With the passage of this Bill, it made many of these things permanent. I think that in and of itself is good. Now, when you look at kind of breaking it down for us on an ETR basis, I'm not expecting much impact. Again, our current run rate had in it primarily the 2017 effect.\nThis just extends and makes that permanent. If anything, if this did not pass, I would have expected a worse ETR. Given it is not, I expect no change on the cash tax front. This will be net beneficial, and the primary driver is the reinstatement of the bonus depreciation. You may recall that was something that was part of the 2017 Act. However, it phased out and essentially has been gone for probably a little over a year. With both the reinstatement of that and the retroactive nature back to January this year, it will give cash tax benefits to companies that make large capital investments into the country, of which we will benefit from that, especially given the vast majority of our backlog right now has US exposure. What that also will do is make IRRs on projects better. We saw the same effect in 2017.\nHow much the IRR improves, it's a function of a couple different things. I'd say on average, you probably see you could see almost 100 basis point improvement. Anyone making long term investments in the country now will get a tailwind from the accelerated depreciation. They'll get more confidence from making permanent a lot of the tax policy. I think all in all, that'll be a positive development. Now, aside from income taxes, clearly 45Q was enhanced a bit. We view that as positive. That's something that, as Sanjiv mentioned, is, I'd say, the primary incentive that was being looked at for a lot of the blue projects. By making that even more attractive, I think that will further help any views to use that. For us, we view it as net, net positive.\nI would say anyone constructing in the country would view it as positive for capital intensity, and any type of low-carbon products, especially with a hydrocarbon base, would view it as positive. That's kind of how I would summarize it.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of James Hooper with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nJames Hooper\n\nVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Europe and a little bit about the energy transition there. Clearly your backlog is a very small percentage European, and we've seen some of your competitors winning low carbon hydrogen projects. We've seen, since you last reported, we've seen the EU action plan and the start of a plan to make a plan, if you will. Do you see this being more of an opportunity for you, for your backlog going forward? And this made you any more positive on energy transition in the region? Thanks.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nJames. I will say that there is a measured level of pragmatism in Europe today around the energy transition and the goals. Remember, however, you know, the people that we are speaking to, and primarily in this instance, the German government, the new government that's come in, and giving them a sense of how we think about this regulatory framework that's in place. There is, of course, all of Brussels to still contend with, but there is a higher degree of pragmatism. There is clearly a move towards getting a bit more practical around some of this target setting, etc. So, yes, I do see that as potentially having a beneficial impact on energy transition projects, which would have an economic basis and which would support a cost-effective decarbonization program for Europe.\nBut there is, in Europe, most things will take time and this will be no exception to that. So, you know, while I appreciate the pragmatism I'm seeing, I still expect that it's going to take as long as it takes for them to actually enact whatever Bills are needed to get to a point where you get cost competitive hydrogen in those countries to support the decarbonization effort.\n\nJames Hooper\n\nVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much for taking my question, Sanjiv. You actually just hit on this a little bit. But behind everything else that's going on in Europe, on the clean energy side, there's also been a lot of debate among the EU27 states regarding just improving efficiencies, you know, protecting the chemical industry. Obviously a lot of your core customers have been actively involved in discussions. Could you potentially. And there's been a lot of news even in the last three weeks or so. Could you just give us a little insights on how integral you are to those conversations? How, you know, the Linde platform could perhaps, you know, help along in terms of basically, you know, setting some guardrails and then also in terms of just the, you know, potential for greater infrastructure growth spend towards the end of the decade.\nI mean, is it wrong to think about Europe slightly differently these days or is it still essentially the status quo over the longer term? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde",
    "content2": "So, Chris, I kind of tried to describe this earlier. I'll say to you, let me deal with the infrastructure project first because that really is somewhat fundamental to any industrial recovery that's going to happen in Europe. I think when I talk about infrastructure, I'm including defense, as is part of that. Germany's commitment to EUR 1 trillion I think is clearly, you know, a very significant milestone for Germany as a country with the balance sheet and the ability to, you know, kind of finance that kind of spend. So in many ways that spending is certainly going to change our perspective and has changed our perspective on how we think about the recovery, industrial recovery in Europe, longer term; that's a 10-year program.\nI manage people's expectations by telling them that look for any procurement process to come in place to handle that kind of spend. For infrastructure projects, there's the need for permitting, etc., which across Europe generally and Germany specifically all take time. So don't expect any exciting announcements in the next couple of years. Maybe the back end of next year you'll start seeing some of those early projects announced. But really most of that allocation you should expect in the following year beyond that. So it's going to take some time. But the longer-term view around the European economy and industrial activity is benefiting from these commitments that have been made. Obviously Germany's made that very significant and specific commitment. Other countries have now signed up to this 5% spend for NATO.\nSome of that is infrastructure, 1.5%, and 3.5% is defense. All of that's going to drive some level of industrial activity. So absolutely right in saying that the perspective on Europe has changed a little bit. I am still cautious when I look at that. We have to see this play out and get enacted, and then transact it, before I will tell you with confidence in the next year I would see this kind of growth. But for now, I think directionally it's headed in the right direction, and your earlier comment, Linde's position in most of the serious conversations that happen in Europe, particularly given our position in Germany, we are both consulted and part of many.\nGroups that are working to ensure that the real challenges that industry in Europe broadly faces, because most of them being customers of ours, you know, is being adequately communicated to those who are making these decisions.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nThank you, Abby. Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. Have a safe day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, once again, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation.

Today's presentation materials are on our website at linde.com in the Investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosures. On Page 2 of the slides, note that it applies to all statements. Made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are. In the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and. Then Matt will give an update on. Linde's Q1 financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv Lamba.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Juan, and very good morning, everyone. Last quarter we took a fairly cautious view on the economy, and unfortunately things mostly played out as anticipated. Yet despite those headwinds, Linde employees once again delivered resilient results by growing EPS by 8%, expanding operating margins 120 basis points to 30.1%, and maintaining industry-leading ROC at 25.7%. It's during volatile and uncertain times like today, when the Linde operating model truly stands out. To demonstrate that, Slide 3 provides an overview of the defensive nature of our business.\nSome of you may recall this slide. That is because we presented a version of it in April 2020, another period when financial markets were gripped with fear and uncertainty. Linde managed through a challenging 2020 and demonstrated its resiliency by growing EPS 12% that year, and I fully expect this defensiveness to be on display for 2025 and beyond. Now we define defensive sales as businesses which contain at least one of the three categories. The first category represents resilient end-markets that tend to be independent of economic trends such as healthcare, electronics, or food and beverage. Over the last few decades we have found these end-markets remain quite stable even during the most challenging periods, while also offering nice opportunities for growth throughout various economic cycles.\nThe second category represents on-site customers from any end-market who pay fixed facility fees that are independent of volumes. These fees are contractually required to recover a capital investment and are part of virtually every on-site agreement. This structure gives us significant earnings stability, which has been proven during the most difficult times, and the final category relates to rental payments on our owned assets such as tanks, cylinders, and equipment. Although the asset network requires upfront capital outlay, the contractual rental fees help recover the initial investment regardless of gas consumption.\nIndividually, these categories have proven to provide resilient revenues and cash flow underpinned by a dense supply network around the world, especially during times of economic stress. So the dark blue shading on the slide represents these three defensive categories which together account for almost two-third of global gas sales.\nAdditionally, this split is almost identical in every segment, further reinforcing the consistency of our business model in every geography, and this is ultimately validated by the chart on the right showing our 12% EPS compound annual growth rate over the last three decades. Overall, the model has proven itself and stood the test of time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. When looking at the current environment, we're seeing more negative than positive developments, so it may be helpful if I can provide some color on the Q1 trends by segment.\nStarting in APAC, China trends have remained consistent when adjusting for seasonally weaker Q1. We're still seeing strength in battery and electronics, although rare gases and helium prices remained lower than prior year. Regarding the industrial end-markets, we continue seeing softness across most, although our customers are primarily Tier 1 producers and thus have been much more stable. Korea is mostly tied to the electronics sector and our largest customer there recently announced further expansion resulting in a new project win for Linde. Australia has seen weaker manufacturing trends directly impacting packaged gas volumes, while India on the other hand remains one of the better growth regions globally.\nMoving to EMEA, we have not seen any meaningful improvement in industrial activity despite some of the recent positive news regarding increased government spending. However, I am encouraged by the more pragmatic discussions around decarbonization which could help accelerate potential growth opportunities. Furthermore, we are very well-positioned for any economic recovery or increased infrastructure spending.\nThe Americas segment has been more of a mixed bag. On one hand, Canada and US packaged gases are seeing some weakness from manufacturing uncertainty. On the other hand, US bulk North Latin America volumes continue to grow low-to-mid-single-digit percent. Americas has the highest segment price increase at 3%, reflecting the inflationary pressure we see in this segment. I fully expect us to stay ahead. Of any inflationary pressure through a combination of contractual pricing clauses as well as our productivity programs.\nThe quarter ended with a strong backlog of $10 billion, of which more than $7 billion is sale of gas projects, all underpinned by long-term contracts with secured returns driving future growth. You may recall from our prior earnings call that project contribution is part of our EPS growth algorithm and despite the uncertainty, I expect we will continue to announce new wins in the quarters ahead. In summary, the rapid changes in global trade policy are having a dampening effect on overall industrial activity, so I'd anticipate more volatility in end-market trends until there is greater clarity and stability.\nAnd while no one could predict what will happen next week, let alone next quarter, I'm confident Linde will navigate the uncertainty by not only leveraging our operating rhythm to quickly adapt, but also continuing to deliver high-quality growth. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. First-quarter results can be found on Slide 4. Sales of $8.1 billion were flat to prior year and down 2% sequentially versus prior year. The foreign currency headwind was volatile, starting at 4% but ending with 2%, for an overall first-quarter average of 3%. Cost pass-through increased 1% from higher natural gas pricing but had minimal effect on profit. Net acquisitions contributed 1% primarily from packaged gas tuck-ins in North America as we continue to see attractive roll-up opportunities justified by cost synergies.\nExcluding these items, underlying sales increased 1% from last year as higher pricing was partially offset by lower volumes. Pricing tracked with globally weighted inflation everywhere, except for APAC, which was impacted by lower prices in helium and rare gases. Volumes declined 1% as 2. Lower base volumes were partially offset by contribution from the project backlog. As Sanjiv mentioned, industrial activity remains sluggish in most geographies and therefore has dragged down base volumes.\nSequentially, underlying sales are down 1% as higher pricing is more than offset by lower volumes. The lower volume is primarily driven by seasonal factors, especially in APAC, although we did experience weaker trends in certain packaged gas markets. Operating profit at $2.4 billion increased 4% and resulted in a margin of 30.1% or 120 basis points higher than prior year. All segments expanded operating margin as management actions in pricing and cost productivity more than compensated weaker base volumes.\nDespite the economic challenges, we expect management actions to continue to support profit growth and margin expansion. EPS of $3.95 was 5% over prior year or 8% when excluding the effects of currency translation. We finished the quarter at the top end of the guidance range due to slightly better FX as benefits from cost and pricing actions were mostly offset by weaker volumes. CapEx of $1.3 billion was equally split between base CapEx and project backlog. As a reminder, Linde has the most stringent project backlog definition in the industry, which requires incremental growth underpinned by fixed fees and contract clauses to protect the overall return.\nBase CapEx includes all other growth investments not meeting our backlog definition as well as maintenance and replacement spend. The 58% increase in project CapEx supports the record $7 billion backlog. We're actively constructing the two largest projects in our history, so I anticipate elevated levels for a few more quarters. Conversely, base CapEx has declined from lower volumes and productivity actions. Slide 5 provides further details on quarterly capital management. The operating cash flow trend can be seen to the left with the most recent quarter of $2.2 billion increasing 11% above last year.\nNote, the first half is weaker due to seasonality of cash payment timing for interest, taxes, and incentives for 2025. I anticipate a similar trend as last year. Disciplined capital allocation is a hallmark of Linde culture and the pie chart to the right demonstrates the balance across investing into the business and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter we raised the annual dividend by 8%, representing 32 straight years of dividend growth with an average rate of 13%. We also repurchased $1.1 billion of stock while reinvesting almost $1.3 billion back into the business. The steady capital allocation model is underpinned by quality credit metrics and access to low-cost funding as evidenced by our most recent 3% average bond coupon.\nIn uncertain and volatile times like today, having a fortress balance sheet is critical for not only maintaining stability but also capitalizing on growth and share repurchase opportunities as they arise. I'll wrap up with a guidance update on Slide 6. For Q2. The EPS guidance range is $3.95 to 4.05. This represents 3% to 5 growth or 5% to 7 when excluding a 2% currency headwind. This range assumes recessionary conditions at the midpoint, translating to roughly 2% EPS headwind from lower volumes. Therefore, while the assumed FX headwind improved by 2%, we offset that benefit with an equivalent volume contraction at the midpoint.\nConsistent with our normal approach. This is merely an economic placeholder based on current trends. If things are better, we'll perform better and if worse, we'll take actions to mitigate. However, it's important to note this range still follows our long-term EPS growth algorithm with double-digit percent growth from capital allocation and management actions partially offset by the current unfavorable economic impact, including currency translation. The full-year guide follows the same approach as Q2, resulting in an updated range of $16.20 to 16.50. FX improved by 2% but was offset by an equally negative volume assumption at the midpoint. All in we're holding the original guidance midpoint, but are narrowing the range by a nickel on each end due to less remaining quarters.\nOverall, we believe it's prudent to remain guarded in this environment, but do not mistake our prudence for complacency. We continue to manage the things within our control by taking proactive actions and adhering to our long-term proven capital allocation strategy. Additionally, we're leveraging our secure balance sheet engineering capabilities and unrivaled supply network to capture opportunities that will position us for the future. Eventually the economy will recover, at which point Linde will be well-positioned to benefit, with 2021 being the most recent example. Until that time, investors can rest assured knowing that our employees will continue to exemplify the no-excuses execution culture which has been the bedrock of our long-term compound value creation. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, and we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many of your questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one if you would like to join the queue. And your first question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning, team. Question as it relates to your backlog. Dow recently announced the delay of its Alberta project. Linde is a partner on that. Can you speak to what impact you. Expect that to have on your associated. Project timing and startup, or what contingencies Linde has to protect itself there?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Mike. As you'd expect, most on-site contracts that we've had and continue to have build in contractual protection for events such as delays driven by customers. This is not new. It typically happens. There is a typical grace period beyond which we have our invoicing that starts and the customer starts paying. This is going to be no different in terms of the contractual protection that we have on the contract, obviously. Having said that, we'll be working with Dow to look at alternatives and opportunities to see how we can help them meet their goals while maintaining Linde's interest in the project.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Haynes\n\nEquity Research Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. This is Steven Haynes on for Vincent. Thank you for taking my question. The EMEA margin performance was super robust in the quarter, and I think this is kind of coming collectively. Even with your volumes down, you know, high-single-digits over the last few years, can you kind of help us think a little bit about, like, what the margin profile could look like once volumes start to return eventually, at some point? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo the EMEA margins have been, you know, the result of some very hard work done over that by that team over a period of time. I think making sure things that we control, pricing, productivity—get the attention that they deserve and are translated into results that reflect that margin number today. Obviously, that's in the face of the volume kind of downside that he talked about. Our expectation is, as volumes improve, those margins will continue to grow, which has been proven over time.\n\nSteven Haynes\n\nEquity Research Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Chemicals, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, guys. It was two years ago, you guys rolled out the slide where you talked about $50 billion of opportunity around clean energy. You know, a lot of changes in the world as we're looking at that now. When you look at that market today, you know, how would you, would you size it differently? Would you size the timing of it differently? You know, what are customers coming back to you saying, you know, how much trust do they have in pieces of the IRA? You know, some of the stuff that was driving that forward, you know, because it was, you know, going to be a decent part of the economy for you guys to grow. Just, you know, get your view on kind of where that is today.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo, Duffy, you're right. We kind of laid that out a couple of years ago when we laid out the strategy which said, look, we'll decarbonize our own operations, we'll support our customer decarbonization process, and of course there are new energy markets that, you know, will come through. We did offer that $50 billion over a period of 10+ years. So there's a long time to go. As we reflect on that number, I think, you know, we see the opportunity set that we have around clean energy projects still looking fairly attractive. The feeder pool into that $50 billion looks still reasonable. I think what's more important is to focus on the slightly more shorter-term. And we said that, look, we expect $8 to 10 billion over the next few years.\nI think the point to make over here, Duffy, is that we are about halfway through there with the two projects that we're currently executing. Our expectation remains that some of those projects are likely to see additional trains in due course. Of course, other projects developing elsewhere in the Middle East and Europe could add to that tally. I'd say to you, standing here, I still feel reasonably confident that $8 to 10 billion over the next few years is something that we still feel that we are set to get to. That's kind of what the numbers look like just in terms of feedback. I think it's important to note over here, and you've heard me say this before, so at the point of.\nI'm kind of belaboring the point over here a little bit, but we've always differentiated between two different types of projects. The low-carbon hydrogen project, which is what is also known as blue hydrogen development, as well as renewable hydrogen or green hydrogen development. You've heard me say in the past that green hydrogen development, from my point of view, isn't at scale today, doesn't have the competitive cost base that is necessary or indeed requires to have significant reduction in capital intensity to get to that point of inflection. We've said in the past, and I maintain that that's probably five-to-seven years out. You'll be pleased to note that in our portfolio project that we're pursuing, that is a very small percentage related to renewable hydrogen.\nWe only do that opportunistically where there is potentially a very low-cost renewable energy access and so on and so forth. The primary development in our project pipeline is related to low-carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen. And again, you know, a lot of people reference IRA. I always want to remind folks that the clause that we should be talking about and thinking about is 45Q, which predates the IRA. And that clause is supporting producing hydrogen using natural gas, converting that using an autothermal reformer or a steam methane reformer, and taking the carbon dioxide that is produced, capturing it and sequestering it, and hence that 45Q credit of $85 per ton, which we feel reasonably confident at this point in time.\nI think, you know, I'm being brave in this world, but I feel confident that that has the support necessary as we move forward. And that's really what's underpinning the project development cycle that we're looking at. And that's where we feel the larger project development world that Linde is doing is concentrated on. And that looks pretty resilient as as this time.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nAnd maybe Duffy, just one thing I'll add to Sanjiv's as well is, you know, when you reference it on the algorithm, you know, we've always said the capital allocation algorithm; we expect 4% to 6. That's been our stable contribution going back a couple decades. And it absolutely includes projects like Sanjeev mentioned, and we feel good about that. But it also includes buybacks, it includes acquisitions, and it includes capital structure. These are all uses of capital. And you saw this quarter, acquisitions now rounding up to 1%. We're seeing opportunities to do that. We continue to see buyback opportunities in the way the markets are reacting. So we have mechanisms and means to continue to contribute on that algorithm, even as some of these projects might be a little bit delayed or until they contribute. So we still feel good about our ability to deliver on that.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Chemicals, Goldman Sachs\n\nAwesome. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. On your guidance, you lowered it by roughly $0.30. FX was the vast majority in the Americas due to weak manufacturing. If it was, which manufacturing end-markets are you seeing the greatest slowing or demand weakness? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nI'll let Matt talk about the guidance, and I'll give you a flavor of what we're seeing in the US manufacturing.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, sure. So I think, David, on the guidance, if you start with the FX change, as I mentioned, you know, it was 4% in the beginning of the quarter, went to 2% by the end, averaged at 3%. Just as a reminder, when we put a guidance estimate, and it's merely an estimate into our range here, we take the forward rates at the beginning of each month. So what I'm telling you right now was the forward rate as of 1 April. We haven't updated that for today's forward rate, which we'll do. And then of course we book the average rate as it occurs. Clearly the rates have moved a little bit, I would say, to a further weakening dollar.\nWhen you think about what's moved the most, the Euro has helped the most, given that seems to be more of a flight-to-quality currency today. The sterling helped a bit, and then on LATAM currencies it's been a mixed bag, I'd say between the peso and the real. So that's how we thought about that. And then clearly what you're seeing in this environment and normally when we'd see risk off, you'd see a strengthening dollar, which with a weakening environment, it's a bit inverted now you're seeing basically a weakening dollar with a weakening environment. So we are getting some offset in that, and that's how we've laid it out. Time will tell, but like we said, if things are better, we'll do better. But I'll hand over to Sanjiv to give more update on Americas trends.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo I'm going to focus on manufacturing, which I think was your question, David. So manufacturing in Q1 for the US was softer than prior year, and that is a combination of factors, including the fact that we had a couple of weather events in both January and February, particularly in the south and southeast of the US, which obviously impacted that. We didn't end the quarter strong with a strong March, probably for the first time in many quarters, we saw some core manufacturing growth, both in gases and hard goods. In April that trend appears to continue to be there. It's slightly moderated in the pace of movement forward, but it's still intact. As I think about the industry that impacted that, when we look at it, we saw automotive, agricultural products, mining, etc., which were soft, not a surprise.\nOffset in part by general fabrication, energy, chemicals, and of course construction now in April. Also I'd say to you that sentiment for the larger customers has turned more negative, obviously given the uncertainty and lack of stability in the market, and potential for high inflation. So you can see that reflected in the PMI numbers that you've seen. So while sentiment has turned, we haven't seen that reflect in volumes just yet. And indeed some customers are still buying on the hard goods side, are actually making investments in larger CapEx items such as automation, which is kind of essential for productivity, particularly if you have labor shortages. So, you know, I think overall I'd just say that manufacturing has been more resilient than people had expected.\nObviously, the expectation remains that if you get some policy certainty and if you get some stability, you know, which have been creating some headwinds, you will see potentially in the second half of the year a likely pickup in manufacturing once those conditions are met.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Clark\n\nHead of Global Chemicals Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nYes. Good morning, everyone. It's on the electronics, I think, with the fourth quarter. Sanjiv, you were saying you're expected to sign new signatures very shortly. You sign something in Korea with your relationship with Samsung, with an expansion. I'm just wondering, clearly other things are bubbling because that side of the backlog actually in terms of value terms with startup diminished a little going into Q1. And then just a quick follow-up: EMEA, I mean, I always thought that should be the highest margin business. You're delivering over 35% now. Is there anything exceptional helping that? Is it the volumes perhaps in the smaller on-site business being a bit softer, giving it a little bit of a profit boost, or is it just nothing extraordinary, just delivering on the model?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo why not begin with the margin, Peter, and just say that it is fundamentally the model. I don't think there is anything particularly offsetting special in there. It's a fundamental business that has gone from being a 19% margin business back in 2019 to being a 35%-plus business today. I think it's taken a lot of hard work to get there. I think credit to the team having worked through the energy crisis, you know, the war in Ukraine, and all of that to get, to get us here. I remain confident that that team really has the algorithm worked out and are executing it every day to make sure that they maintain that margin and move forward with it. Let me go back to backlog then, and I'll talk about backlog generally. Then we talk a little bit about the Korean win.\nIn Q4 I did say that you should expect us to announce some electronics projects. This is first of a few that I expect that we will be announcing. The backlog overall $10+ billion, $7 billion of that is sitting in the sale-of-gas side, which is where most of the interest is. My expectation is that this year, probably towards the second half of the year, we will start up about $1 billion out of that backlog. The best thing that happens in a backlog, as I've always said, is you start the projects up and it comes out of your backlog and your backlog shrinks. Now the good news is I fully expect that we will end the year with a backlog with a seven handle on it. In fact, I expect it will be slightly higher than what we have today.\nSo I feel pretty good about the projects that we're currently developing. Despite everything you read in the news, we have a good pipeline of projects. I think Matt made the point really eloquently earlier on. Our algorithm says that our capital allocation will deliver 4% to 6% of the EPS growth, and feeding into that is high-quality projects. And much of those projects will come from our traditional end-markets. There'll be some from clean energy, but much of the project development will actually come, and the project wins will come from our traditional end-market. So that's kind of what gives us confidence that the backlog is going to look pretty good. And the project win rate is looking particularly strong at this point in time, given the circumstances in which we are operating.\n\nPeter Clark\n\nHead of Global Chemicals Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nHi. Morning. Actually, you just kind of answered what I had in mind, which was, away from Dow, have you seen any risk around delays or slowdowns on what is currently in the backlog? So, startups that were due in Q2 that may be delayed to H2, for instance, or indeed lower from customers. But, Sanjiv, as you just said, that you are quite confident to sign those projects. Can you talk about the areas where you see the biggest commitments, either geographically or in terms of end-markets?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nYeah, and why not do two things? I'll just talk about how I'm seeing the markets for the rest of the year more broadly, and then we talk about some of the investment trends that we're seeing as well. And Matt mentioned earlier on that from a guidance point of view, and you've seen this as well in the slides. We're considering recessionary conditions now at the midpoint. And as I look around, when you think about end markets, our resilient end markets are still going to grow. That's led by electronics, food and beverage, et cetera, low-to-mid single-digit. It's the more cyclical markets of the industrial sector which is likely to see lower volumes towards the rest of the year, mainly in metals and chemicals. So. So that's kind of where you're thinking about from an end-market perspective.\nAs you look at it geographically, we expect volumes in Americas to remain flattish for the year. That's kind of built into how we are thinking about the guidance. The resilient end markets obviously will continue to find their growth, but they will be more than offset by softer industrial sector, not dissimilar to what we saw last year. So I think we'll kind of see that trend maintained. Americas flattish is how you should think about it. Europe, there is, unfortunately, as we said before, no catalyst or change to the current trajectory. So we see continued softening in demand mainly in Western Europe. Again, resilient end markets will continue to grow, but I expect that more than offsets, that is more than offset by the industrial sector. Metals, manufacturing, chemicals, energy, all of them will see lower volumes versus prior year.\nSo that's where I think most of the weakness will lie in Asia. China is a mixed bag. I said that in my prepared remarks. I think as we look ahead, I'm not expecting any growth from China for the year. There are some green shoots, batteries, electronics. They are areas where you are seeing some growth. But metals and chemicals will continue to be weaker for the rest of the year. I also expect, in Q2 in particular, the export-driven markets, you know, manufacturing in particular, will see continued softening given the tariff headwinds and the uncertainty that kind of lies around that.\nThe bright spark in Asia Pacific is India, and we obviously see continuing trend of investments, and volume growth over there, and we are obviously, as you know, well-positioned to participate in that. South Korea, I mentioned the project that we've just won, which hopefully gives you a sense of, you know, how South Korea growth will look. Some growth this year, but obviously a lot of project activity continuing over there, which looks good. So if I summarized from an outlook perspective, which is then reflected back into our guidance, Americas flattish, APAC largely balanced despite the headwinds in China, and Europe or EMEA really where you'll see weakening volumes kind of reflecting.\nIn that outlook that we presented. Now, against this backdrop as we think about CapEx, it is the secular growth opportunities that are particularly driving the CapEx growth for us. So electronics will play a big part in that. But alongside that there are wins happening geographically in Asia in particular which are more metals, chemicals; these are smaller wins, but notwithstanding they add to the overall portfolio wins we're looking at. So we will see some clean energy projects, but we are going to see a lot of electronics projects; we're going to see some metals, we're going to see some refining, even some chemicals projects come through in other parts of the world, and I think that's what will kind of create the balance to get us to that backlog that I referenced earlier on.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much. I have a couple of questions around your income statement. In 2024 your other income was $200 million, sort of a positive change of about $234 million. Normally that number is pretty low. What's your expectation for 2025? And secondly, in your SG&A expense, I think was down 9% from $860 to 786. How did you do that? Is there something unusual in that number? If your SG&A was flat, roughly your operating profits would have been flat in the quarter. Can you talk about the different pressures that your income statement seems to be under, and, you know, how you're coping with that? Is, is your SG&A going to be down 9% for the year or was the first quarter unusual?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nJeff, I'm going to let Matt, who's looking forward to responding to you on these questions, respond back, but I'm just going to touch on SG&A and tell you this very briefly. It takes a lot of hard work and management actions, and as you know, last year in the third quarter we took the restructuring charge. That's all being executed as we speak. That obviously is reflected in the SG&A line in addition to the fact that we have lower incentive compensation that's sitting in there as well, which obviously gets normalized over time. But I'm sure Matt will have a far more elegant response to that. Matt?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nHey Jeff. So let's start with other income, you know, first what's in it, right. Probably is a good way to start. And other income for us, what we put there is either large items, extraordinary, either gain or loss that we feel are operating-related obviously, but either are large enough we carve out or could be based on a prior timing. So last year, about a quarter of that number, you may recall, was a large insurance claim that we had. We actually spiked that out in Q1. In fact, when you look at the Q1 year-over-year you see a fairly large drop in other income going from almost around $60 million to 20 million. So that actually was a large insurance. Now clearly we had losses prior to that and going forward on that because it included a BI element.\nTo some extent you have a little bit of a timing mismatch because of the claim you got in insurance against the backdrop of some ongoing BI impact from that incident that occurred. That was actually in the Other segment you may recall on our materials business. Outside of that, there are going to be some gains and losses on certain sales. We also did have some other offsetting items actually above other income that we had talked about in the past as well. Now we don't give a projection on that number, but I fully don't expect 2025 to be near that level. In fact, you already saw the first quarter as I mentioned; we're already down $40 million.\nSo I think 2025 will be more representative of 2023 or prior years, as whereas we didn't have such a large insurance benefit or some of the other items that occurred in 2024. As far as SG&A, we'll start with, you know, about a quarter of that's currency. Okay. So obviously we talk about the FX hurt on op, but in SGA we equally have costs that are foreign denominated, so you get that benefit. But even outside of the FX, we did take a restructuring charge in Q4. As you know, we need to see the benefits of that, and those benefits primarily manifest themselves in lower headcount and lower SG&A spend. So there is the benefits, the productivity associated with that. Right now my expectation is the actions we've taken for the most part have offset any normal growth in merit or SG&A.\nBut on top of that, we did have a fairly sizable year-on-year reduction of incentive comp. We are a pay-for-performance culture and we're not performing. We understand that we're not meeting our targets and therefore the incentive comp is lower. So I expect it could remain lower for the remainder of the year. It will probably be a little lumpier because it's a function of the projections and the forecast of the payout ratios. But I fully expect lower compensation payout this year than prior year and that'll be reflected in the accruals because our shareholders also are suffering through this. So we need to as well.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. Matt, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you attributed productivity and pricing as the drivers of that 120-basis-points operating-margin improvement year-over-year that more than offset lower volumes, and you know, a little bit of. The cost increase. Pardon me. My question for you is. Can you size those two buckets? The productivity and pricing, how would you size those two to drive that margin expansion? And maybe more specifically on productivity, what all are you doing these days on driving that? Historically, headcount reduction was a big lever for you guys. But moving forward, do you still see that as a meaningful opportunity and any changes in your approach at achieving that productivity gain?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, sure, Steve. So we'll start with how to size it. So I think an easy way to think about this is going back to the earnings algorithm. And as you recall, we give three pillars: capital allocation, which we say is 4% to 6; management actions, which is at least another 4% to 6, if not more; and then the macro, which is base volumes and FX. Management actions represents price, less cost, and the productivity. We always think about that as a spread. So you each one individually is not as important as the spread. So while price is important and while cost is important, the spread between the two is the most important.\nSo as long as you achieve positive spreads in all of your geographies, that will be 100% contribution towards margins; it is purely margin accretive in that regard. And the management actions over our prior two-to-three decades of EPS growth has consistently contributed probably close to two-thirds of our EPS growth in the algorithm. And so when you think about more than half of your growth coming from that area, that by default will result in a margin accretion aspect. Now I will say in tougher times, and arguably we're in a little bit of a tougher time right now, you're going to see larger margin expansion because the management actions as a percentage of the whole algorithm is greater.\nAnd then when you see recovery times, and I mentioned 2020, 2021 where we grew EPS 30% when you see recovery times, then the margin may not expand as much as you normally would see it because macro becomes a much bigger driver. You will get, we'll get margin expansion, just not at the same level you might with a management action. So I think from that, and that's how we think about it as far as productivity initiatives, clearly you're going to have. Technology advancements will always give us opportunities, AI being the current version. But there's always going to be developments that give us opportunity to do more. I would never underestimate that. As the world changes, new opportunities create themselves.\nWhen you see even areas where you might have some slowdowns, we will look at new ways of how we do our distributions, how we source our products. It's always a discussion of fixed versus variable cost and what's the appropriate way to address a market for the time we see it operating in a certain capacity. And by doing that we can find synergies by increasing or decreasing the operating leverage of the business by either extending more variable costs or by reducing variable and going fixed costs for greater recovery. So it is always a continuous effort. It's always evolving. There's never an end game. That's why we never name our programs. It's integrated with the culture. And so from that end, it's not one silver bullet. If there was, then I probably wouldn't believe it. It's a lot of things.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nTo that point, Steve, let me just give you a bit of color. There is no one silver bullet, and we are grateful for that because we want every part of our business engaged in productivity effort every day. Last year we did 15,515 projects. This year, in the first quarter we've done more than 4,000 projects. More than 4,000 projects. It takes every part of the organization to look at the opportunity every day and make sure that that gets happened. Not only does it get executed, it's actually then recorded, and the learnings are then cascaded to the rest of the world. I'll give you a couple of quick examples just to illustrate how practically we're looking at productivity. So obviously ASU operations are very power-intensive. As you know, we are one of the largest purchases of power globally.\nOptimizing that even by a small percentage has a big impact. So we have a power optimizer model that is currently using AI to optimize the way we operate our plants. Depending on the level of customers' demand, on the tank level that we have, the tank level our liquid customers have, and the power pricing that's going to happen. From a predictive point of view, there's a good example of something which we perfected over many years now being, you know, kind of having its biggest impact because we're able to do it real-time using an AI model. Two other quick examples. The other one would be distribution.\nOne of the things that, you know, we are doing is deploying telemetry so that we understand exactly the tank levels that exist within our customers' tankage and our ability to then distribute and schedule that distribution load in a way that further optimizes and creates efficiency on the use of the asset, as well as ensures that we are getting to the point where the customer's at a load level that we think is appropriate for us to refill. So again, a lot of sophisticated machine learning models sitting behind that, which track the telemetry, track the usage of the customer typically has, and based on that, do predictive scheduling. Those are two examples. I mean, we have 105 use cases on AI models that we are deploying as we speak. So there is a lot of opportunity around this. I'm excited about one-third, well, about 31% to 32 of all our productivity efforts come out of digital and AI solutions.\n\nSteven Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nVery good, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on your 2025 outlook. When you think about sort of economic contraction, your volumes were down 1% in Q1. Does it, should it stay around that level or does it get a little bit worse as the year unfolds? And then longer term, Sanjiv, it's been pretty unusual downturn for industrial demand. What do you think? What are you looking for? To maybe see a green shoot or so longer term?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo, Matt, why don't you talk about the 2025 outlook in terms of the guidance that we provided?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, I think, Mike, I'd say let's start with not much different than how we normally approach it. So when you think about every 1% of base volume assumptions, roughly 2% EPS impact, give or take maybe 1.5%, depends on the margin profile of the business. And so within that context we still feel very confident around the backlog contribution. So that 1% we have will continue throughout the year positive. And then it's really just a function of the base assumption. And so we put a placeholder in there today, 2% negative EPS contraction, which represent about 1 to 1.5% top-line negative base volume. And we'll see. I mean what I want to reiterate, consistent with prior times, this is not our economic call per se, it's just the placeholder taking kind of the current situation and extrapolating it out.\nWe're going to take actions to mitigate, we're going to take actions to work around it, and time will tell what actually happens. So that's really how we did it. I'd say nothing really different than that. Sanjiv?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Matt. So on the industrial. Long-term development, Mike, it's difficult to predict next week. So you're asking me to look a lot longer than that. I'll tell you a different way to think about the industrial growth as we go forward. Obviously we've talked about an industrial recession for some time now, and your comments kind of illustrate that as you think about the long-term trends. I'd say to you you need to be looking at maybe three or four different elements that are going to drive that. The first secular growth we've said before, things like end markets like electronics, given AI data center growth, there is a direct correlation to what you see around semiconductor growth underpinning the electronics end market that we have. And I think you should expect to see that growth continue.\nIn fact, I said earlier on today in my comments on the backlog that I expect that we will continue to see that reflecting the recent win with Samsung, but hopefully others as well as we move forward. So there'll be secular growth drivers like that that will continue to be an exciting part of the kind of growth algorithm underpinning any industrial recovery that we see longer term. The other piece that I think is worth mentioning is there are high-growth markets around the world where we have obviously a very strong footprint. Being in 81 countries is an advantage in the sense that we are well-positioned in the market that we expect to see either as a result of some of the arbitrage coming out of the tariff developments or as a result of just locally-driven consumption driving growth in markets.\nSo markets like India, which we kind of mentioned a couple of times, a bright spark as far as growth is concerned. Obviously we still expect Mexico, Indonesia, and other markets like that to continue to have a growth trajectory that will hopefully help the overall industrial recovery piece. Last but not least is new growth markets. These are nascent. You don't have to hear us talk too much about it. But examples of aerospace, where we are seeing significant growth and expect to see continued growth in that sector, I think is an area that will continue to gain in size and scale. And as it does, it'll actually support the elements of growth that we talk about longer term. Longer term, I'll also say to you that quantum computing is another trend that we expect will have an opportunity.\nIt does need to mature. It is still nascent technology, but as it matures and scales up, the fact that quantum computing requires cryogenic cooling is an exciting opportunity from a Linde perspective. We have some great proprietary technology around that and we're excited to see what happens in that space. Even today, we are providing some cryogenic cooling technologies even for the pilots that are happening around the world. So I see that as another example of a new growth market that we'll continue to pursue. Those will really drive that industrial recovery, obviously underpinned by a recovery in the normal cyclical cycle that you'll see for most industries that will obviously come back. That's always been the case. And we fully expect that obviously a bit of stability around trade rules and so on and so forth will kind of accelerate that recovery as it happens.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. Healthcare starting to trend positively. Positive growth year-on-year. How much portfolio rationalization is left to go there, and when do you expect to return to the long-term growth rate and related follow up? While it's not currently the top of the list for the administration, would you see deregulation in US healthcare as an opportunity or perhaps a threat to Lincare?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde",
    "content2": "So as you know we've, you know, let's talk about healthcare broadly and I'll break it up into two parts. Obviously we have a very strong hospital care business, you know, that has got a steady growth rate, continues to be in low-to-mid single-digits, and we see that across the world and obviously post-COVID there's been a greater appreciation of the need for setting up the infrastructure and so therefore some of the, even on the equipment side we see some potential continue to help with that infrastructure build-out. So I expect to see that growth continue to be stable, steady, and continue going forward. The home care business obviously in the US attracts a lot of attention and we have been trimming that portfolio as you're aware.\nWe are leveraging technology today to try and make sure that that business becomes more efficient, reduces the amount of paper that is there, digitizing a lot of processes, et cetera. That's where I think the thrust of our effort in Linde continues to be. It's a business that has to be focused on improving service levels and making sure that we are working on productivity every day. As part of that we will continue to look at our portfolio and whatever we need to do, you know, we continue to do. This isn't a one-off exercise, you know, we look at our portfolio all the time across all our businesses and the home care business is no different to that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemicals Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning, thanks for taking my question. So the US has seen some onshoring already. You guys have been a decent beneficiary on like the electronics front and semiconductor side. While the tariff situation doesn't seem quite settled at this point yet. If the US continues this kind of protectionist mode, do you see other opportunities in some of your other businesses where you might see outsized growth, whether it's tied to, there's some expectations for maybe aluminum and steel picking up in the US relative to other regions, that kind of thing? I guess. Can you help us to think about maybe some of the good guys around some of the tariff discussion versus all the bad guys we've been hearing about for the past few weeks?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nJohn, I think the tariff discussion sometimes becomes one-sided where people are only looking at the risks around that. I think to your point. As the tariffs play out and as they stabilize, people will make decisions around reshoring onshoring back again, and I think that's where you will see some movement. I will tell you in the short term there isn't any development today that I can point to other than electronics where that has a substantive impact. But do we hear conversations and are we being people reaching out to us and having conversations around the potential of setting up new capacities in the US? Yes, we certainly are seeing some of that happen. So my expectation remains that as the conversations around tariff stabilizes we will see more growth. I mean the administration describes it as an industrial resurgence in the US even if that happens in part, it will still be a very attractive opportunity for us just given our density across the US and our presence.\nWe feel really good about the fact that as and when that onshoring, reshoring process takes off, we will be well-positioned to participate in that and see some growth in that. I'm not going to speculate on the sectors or end markets where we're going to see most of that, but clearly electronics already in play. As you know, we won and build the Phoenix supply to the Phoenix fab for TSMC. We are building at Taylor, Texas for Samsung. We're also building for other players in the US. So we certainly see that growth potential on the electronics side for the others, whether it's aluminum, steel, batteries, and so on and so forth. I think there'll be a number of end markets that the potential for onshoring will look attractive, but we'll have to wait and see how that develops.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemicals Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Nice results. If general inflation picks up, do you think your pricing would accelerate? Or because of the weak macroeconomic backdrop here, we might get a disconnect between inflation and your pricing.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nInflation is, you know, we are an inflation play, as you heard us say before; we like inflation. It allows us to move the pricing forward, and absolutely. You know, as you know, we've said many times in the past, a good proxy for our pricing is globally-weighted CPI. So as it picks up, there's an opportunity for us to continue to price that. There is no divergence to that model. We've done that over 25 years. We expect to continue to do that.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes, thank you, and good morning. Sanjiv. From my perspective, Linde's had a very accurate and appropriately cautious view of China in recent years. So I'd be very interested to hear your updated thoughts on the near term, what you're seeing and hearing from your customers in April and May across end markets. And then in terms of, let's say, medium-term planning for China, how much runway do you see on productivity in that country, specifically trying to counterbalance macro risk versus cost help in your algorithm within China?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo Kevin, given where we are today, it's probably easier to speak about the medium term than the near term. But I'm going to address both. I'm going to address both. Now let's start with the medium term to begin with, and I've said this a couple of times. I think it's worth repeating it. The days of 8%, 7, 8 to 10 growth in China long gone, and we are looking our medium term view of China growth, is it will be moderated to low single-digit from an IP perspective. I'm not going to comment on GDP. IP is where we follow.\nMaybe low-to-medium single-digit is the best we will expect to see out of China medium-term in terms of growth. Our efforts in China over the last couple of years. Now, as you would normally expect, we will front-run these efforts. We saw the development in China a couple of years ago and said we are treating Chinese business, our Chinese business, as a mature business and therefore we expect them to take all the actions we would expect from a mature geography anywhere else in the world, which means pricing, productivity, automation, offshoring.\nNon-value-added activities and so on and so forth. I think I still see a fair amount of productivity opportunities sitting in the Chinese business. Also, given that they are leading in many ways around the AIs, we are actually seeing the AI-led use cases for China being quite attractive. I think we gave an example, and one may have shown this video at one stage where we are rolling out our smart plant operations where we're using drones and robots to actually do a lot of the normal work that we would do on an air separation unit, doing readings, looking at pressure gauges, looking at temperature gauges, and making sure that that information is filtered into an AI program that then provides alerts and allows human intervention to take place. Obviously, that then results in being more productive at that particular site.\nIn a couple of provinces in China, we've been able to get approval to reduce the amount of manning on the site as a result of that. So there's an example for you of. A program that we are now rolling out to entire business in China, which will cover a large number of plants for us, giving us benefits coming out of productivity. So expect strong productivity benefits from China to continue, and that's kind of where that business stands on the near term. Let me just, I'm just back from China about four weeks ago. I'm headed there in two weeks time, and that's largely spending time with our customers, speaking to my CEO counterparts to understand how they are looking at the market. I'll give you a quick view on how. I'm just going to give you Q2 as an example. What we are seeing in terms of outlook, which will, I think, hold for most of the year.\nSo steel was very weak; metals generally, and steel specifically, was weak in the first quarter. We expect a mild recovery over there because there were a couple of turnarounds that happened in steel. But broadly steel for the year will continue to be lower than previous year. I think the metals market are reflective of the general industrial lower or declining industrial activity set as far as chemicals are concerned. We are also expecting chemicals to continue to be a little bit softer, and I think that trend is likely to hold for the rest of the year as well and in fact probably beyond that. So there's nothing to suggest in either of those end markets you will see anything different. The areas of growth, the green shoots, are around battery and EV development. You read about it in the press.\nI visited the BYD facilities four weeks ago, spent time with the chairman, spoke about their vision, and they have a fairly significant plan in terms of continuing to grow that base that they've built up on EVs. About 40% of all EVs in China, 40% of all cars in China are today EVs, and the expectation is that number will continue to grow. There's an example of some development of green shoots around EVs and batteries. The other piece I think that is also growing at a reasonably fast pace is electronics. The government has a stated intent of becoming more self-reliant and it is ensuring that there is incentive available for electronics companies to continue to expand and grow. Obviously they don't go to the advanced nodes that you see with TSMC or Samsung or others. But nonetheless, just in terms of the amount of chips being manufactured in China today, the expectation remains that you'll see a lot of growth there.\nThe areas where I see the greatest stress in the near term are going to be the merchant and packaged business, which are really correlated directly to manufacturing. And the fact that we have punitive tariffs in place that are going to upend that manufacturing process over there, you should expect weak demand. I think there will be industrial deflation that are likely to continue in that space. Really, I think there will be pressure at least in Q2, potentially a little bit beyond that. As you think about that space around general manufacturing, that kind of, I think, is where things stand with China today. Do not expect, and we have not built in and we do not expect any recovery in China this year.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our final question from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in, Sanjiv. I wanted to follow-up on one of your early comments. In the prepared remarks, you talked about Europe and a more pragmatic decarbonization approach, and leading to some encouraging conversations. So I just want to see if you could translate what that means for Linde. Where does that add opportunity for you? Is that projects? Is that demand or what does that mean? Thanks.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Josh. So I think the simple answer to that is Europe has struggled with regulatory frameworks being led by ideology rather than pragmatism. I think for the first time, not for the first time, we worked hard at this over the last 18 months to get a general appreciation that low-carbon hydrogen has a very important role to play as people think about decarbonization in Europe, because that's the only way you're going to get a cost competitive, you know, a cost-competitive solution for decarbonization of large industries which have substantive CO2 or greenhouse gas emissions. I think that's probably where my commentary earlier on in my prepared remarks was, reflecting on growing conversations and potential for regulatory change that will accept carbon capture and sequestration as an acceptable solutions supporting low-carbon hydrogen growth.\nA specific example of that would be, you're aware that we have signed a project development agreement with Equinor for the development of low-carbon hydrogen projects in Europe, and that would be a direct beneficiary if the regulatory framework was to move forward. We still have to wait for that to happen. But we do see greater pragmatism and certainly an openness to understanding the benefits and understanding the science behind the conversation we're having. Obviously, in the US, low-carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen, it has, you know, a significant potential because of the support coming from the government through the 45Q elements, but also because, you know, the natural gas pricing and availability, you know, underpins that growth.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Juan Pelaez for closing remarks.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nThank you, everyone, for attending today's call. I wish you all a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nAbby, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2024 Q4 earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, our Chief Executive Officer, and Matt White, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investor section.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations and adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's Q4 financial performance and 2025 outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Looking back, 2024 was another successful year for the Linde organization. I'd like to personally thank the 65,000-plus employees for their relentless drive to deliver shareholder value while they live our core values every day. This isn't something that happens overnight or can be copied or indeed driven top-down from a handful of individuals. Rather, it is a result stemming from decades-long culture, mindset, and operating rhythm.\nIt can best be exemplified by the results shown on slide three. From my perspective, there are four key categories that Linde must excel at day in and day out to maintain a long-term industry-leading position. Of course, we must deliver on our key financial metrics and remain responsible stewards of our owner's capital. That's a given. But we have a sustainable leadership position. For that and the long term, that requires continual investment in our people and surrounding communities, as well as doing our part to help improve the environment.\nFinally, we must position ourselves for the future to ensure resilient and continuous growth and improvement. We can never be complacent based on past performance. I want to start with our people and communities because Linde's success has always been and always will be attributed to our employees' ownership mentality and collective efforts.\nWe continuously strive to be good corporate citizens in thousands of communities where we live and work. Also, having a safe and diverse workforce is a top priority in order to ensure Linde's competitiveness for many years to come. And you can see the improvements we've made from an already leading position. More work is to be done, and I fully expect to leverage technology in that effort, but I am pleased to see the progress made to date. While people and communities are a priority, efforts towards ensuring a sustainable environment are becoming more challenging every day.\nI think it's fair to say we're seeing more extreme weather now than in prior years. And here at Linde, we will continue to do our part to help the environment. Through an increased focus on low-carbon power, Linde increased its active low-carbon and renewable energy consumption by 19% year-over-year.\nIn 2024, over 40% of our total power consumption is now low-carbon-based. These are just a few of the many accomplishments, and I want to encourage you to read our annual report for many more. Furthermore, it is rewarding to see our sustainability efforts being recognized by some of the most prestigious names, such as the Dow Jones, which included Linde in its Sustainability World Index for the 22nd consecutive year. In addition, we pride ourselves in helping our customers avoid more than two times our CO2 emissions through the use of our products and services.\nBut there is much more work ahead to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals, including reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2035.\nTurning to financial performance, Linde once again led the industry across key metrics: 25.9% ROC, EBIT margins increased 190 basis points to 29.5%, EPS increasing 10% XFX, and $7 billion of capital returned to shareholders from the significant excess free cash flow. These are the best metrics in the industry, some by a wide margin. This provides us with a source of pride and ownership, but we also recognize this is the past. Valuations are derived from a combination of past performance and future expectations.\nSo we must continuously position ourselves for future growth, regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. Positioning for future starts with a concise strategy and a capital allocation policy. At Linde, we know that the investments we make and the ones we avoid are equally important because mistakes in this industry can have long-lasting consequences.\nThis is why sticking to our core business while maintaining disciplined contract terms is critical to building safe, reliable, and profitable supply infrastructure. The year ended with more than $10 billion in backlog, including a record sale of gas backlog of $7 billion. Included in this is the $2+ billion Dow Win in Canada, which is a great example of a high-quality project in a core geography. This project not only has fixed payment structure with predicted returns but materially improves our local supply density in a fast-growing region for clean energy. I fully expect to be announcing new projects and customers in the near future.\nBut growing in industrial gas is more than just mega projects. We have to continue keeping our eye on smaller opportunities as well, ensuring that they add attractive annuity-like growth.\nDuring 2024, we once again set a record for small on-site wins, signing 59 long-term agreements for a total of 64 plants, all of which will increase reliability and strengthen our network density. Acquisitions of small tuck-in packaged gas opportunities also remain an important part of synergistic growth, with 18 signed transactions with annualized revenues of approximately $200 million. All in, 2024 was another successful year, despite the many challenges. That being said, it's time to move forward and look ahead.\nAll of you have seen the new earnings guidance for 2025, and therefore I believe it's important to reiterate the components of our long-standing EPS growth algorithm on slide four.For many years now, we've defined our EPS growth into three categories, of which both capital allocation and management actions are within our control. And the economy is not.\nCapital allocation represents contributions from a long-standing and stable capital management policy. The main elements include our contractual project backlog, share repurchases, small bolt-on acquisitions, and capital structure efficiencies generally achieved through interest and tax management. It's important to note that our backlog definition is unique in our industry, as it only includes incremental growth from contractually committed customers with fixed payment elements and termination provisions to ensure a minimum return on capital.\nWhile no other company follows this strict interpretation, it certainly provides Linde greater certainty of backlog EPS contribution in any environment. Similarly, the majority of acquisitions are justified on cost synergies only and therefore provide a high degree of confidence on capital return and thus EPS generation.\nFinally, share repurchases offer an attractive and flexible use of excess free cash flow as project startup and acquisition cadence will ebb and flow, enabling a highly consistent EPS contribution from overall capital allocation. All of these elements have historically contributed 4% to 6% EPS growth, and I feel confident this will continue for the years to come. Management actions represent the daily self-help initiatives our employees undertake to ensure growth regardless of the macro climate.\nDigital solutions and AI are increasingly supporting productivity, price, and cost management, which are controllable initiatives deeply embedded into our culture and operating rhythm, and which allow us to grow earnings regardless of the economy. History has proven for these to be the largest compound value generators, as they are not directly correlated to overall economic activity.\nThis combination of capital allocation and management actions is expected to deliver 10+% EPS growth each year with margin expansion, and 2025 is no exception. With a pre- or post-merger, these two components have been the dominant drivers of our long-term double-digit EPS growth angle. While I remain confident in our ability to deliver on this 10%, we are constantly striving to find more opportunities to improve. Conversely, we cannot control the third category, which represents macroeconomic factors.\nFor Linde, these are two factors that matter the most: the foreign exchange rates and the industrial production as a proxy for base volume trends. Recall that we are a US dollar functional company with approximately two-thirds of earnings denominated in foreign currencies and thus exposed to FX translation.\nSimilarly, while our customers are often under long-term contracts with fixed facility fees, the incremental gas they consume is a function of their own production rates, which typically highly correlates to industrial demand. Hence why global IP is a generic proxy for our customer gas consumption or base volumes. The current 2025 guidance range assumes a 4% FX translation headwind, while the midpoint of the range assumes 0% IP growth environment. Overall, it's clear that the growth algorithm is well intact, but we have our work cut out regarding unfavorable FX translation.\nThis does not come as a surprise, as you may recall from our statements last quarter, and subsequent self-help actions that we initiated. Furthermore, we will continue to identify and execute additional management actions to mitigate macro weaknesses. Eventually, these economic headwinds will convert to tailwinds, as they always do.\nUntil then, you can be rest assured that the entire Linde organization will be focused on creating shareholder value and maintaining our long-term industry leadership, no matter the environment. I'll turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Q4 results can be found on slide five. Sales of $8.3 billion are flat prior year and down 1% sequentially. For both the prior year and sequential comparisons, foreign currency translation was a 2% headwind. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales grew 2% versus last year and were flat from the third quarter. Price increases of 2% over 2023 and 1% sequentially continued to track with globally weighted inflation. The volume growth was flat as contribution from the project backlog in the Americas and APAC offset lower base volumes in EMEA.\nThe sequential volume decline is primarily attributed to softer EMEA metals and mining volumes and seasonality factors in APAC. In general, economic trends mostly followed our prior guidance, although the FX impact was worse than expected from a significant strengthening of the US dollar toward the back half of the Q4. Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 9% and resulted in a 29.9% margin, primarily from management actions around price, cost, and productivity. EPS of $3.97 grew 11% or 13% excluding FX.\nThe 9% CapEx increase is entirely driven by contractual projects, as base CapEx decreased from a combination of currency, productivity, and lower base volumes. I anticipate this trend to continue as we execute on the record $7 billion sale of gas backlog to support future growth. Further details on capital management can be found on slide six.\nFull year operating cash flow ended at $9.4 billion, with almost 60% occurring in the second half. As mentioned in prior calls, I expect this split to remain due to seasonality of specific cash outflows, including incentive payments, taxes, and interest. The pie chart on the right shows the full year capital allocation. We invested $5 billion back into the business, with half underpinned by secured high-quality growth opportunities. We returned $7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.\nReturning this amount of capital to our owners year after year requires a disciplined capital allocation policy and a very healthy balance sheet, two things that are much easier said than done. I'll wrap up with guidance on slide seven. We're initiating full year EPS guidance of $16.15 to $16.55, representing 4% to 7% growth or 8% to 11% when excluding an estimated 4% currency headwind.\nAs mentioned earlier, the 4% impact is from the accounting translation of foreign earnings, which experienced a rapid strengthening of the US dollar toward the end of 2024. Recall this is merely a projection, as we're required to book the actual month's average rate to the income statement. The methodology used for this estimate is consistent with prior practice by using the forward curves on a weighted basis for each foreign currency at the start of the month. Historically, large currency devaluations have often been followed by periods of more significant local inflation, with 2022 being a recent example.\nIf that occurs, I'd anticipate incremental pricing opportunities to recover the currency devaluation impact. These potential pricing opportunities are not baked into the guidance range at this time, since the amount or timing of subsequent inflation is difficult to estimate.\nThe midpoint of this range assumes no economic improvement from the current environment and thus assumes flat base volumes. As Sanjiv mentioned, our base volumes derive from customer supply contracts. Their growth is a function of gas consumption from our contracted tanks and cylinders. Hence why local industrial production tends to be the best proxy. Q1 EPS guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95, with similar assumptions to the full year. At this time, we believe it's appropriate to remain prudent with a more cautious economic outlook. If things turn out better, so too will our results.\nAnd if they worsen, we'll take additional mitigating actions. But regardless of the economy, I'm confident Linde will continue to create shareholder value through our time-tested execution culture, disciplined capital allocation, and proven management actions. This has been embedded in our DNA for decades.\nOver the years, while many have claimed they'll simply copy this model, all have failed. Because here at Linde, we're often imitated but never duplicated. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, press Star one a second time. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question.\nAgain, it is Star one if you would like to join the queue. And your first question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Sanjiv, there's a lot of political noise out there right now between tariff potential, a new administration, and some pullback on green energy funding. I guess, how has your discussions with potential project partners evolved at all? I'm really trying to get at, say, projects that are pre-FID today. Have those discussions slowed down or picked up at all?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo, Mike, as we've referenced in previous calls, we have seen people take a little bit more time and apply a bit more rigor before going to FID. I think it's a good thing because you do need that when you're doing multi-billion-dollar projects typically. And I think we're seeing that phase continue.\nIn there, built in there, obviously, is some uncertainty around the regulatory framework and requirements in terms of what the new administration may or may not do. The one thing I do want to emphasize, though, and I think in the context of clean hydrogen, this is particularly important. People tend to think about the IRA, and there's a lot of talk around what happens with the IRA under the new administration. Within the IRA, there is a specific provision, an IRS provision, in fact, called 45Q, which predates the IRA. It actually goes back to around 2008 when it was implemented.\nAbout 90% of the projects that we are developing in the US are actually looking at 45Q as a potential incentive. I think we feel fairly confident that that structure around the 45Q will remain as given, particularly that it predates the IRA.\nSo I just want to provide that specific clarification because I get a lot of questions around that. But generally, we're seeing people take a bit more time to get to FID, and we're seeing that they are actually being a little bit more rigorous in their approach before they make a final call in terms of putting capital on the ground. The other point I'd just quickly add to that, Mike, is you're aware that in the past we've talked about, I think it was actually two years ago, we talked about $8 to $10 billion in clean energy investments from a Linde perspective.\nWe're about halfway there, given the two projects, the large projects we've already announced, North America. We're obviously continuing to develop projects elsewhere.\nThose two current projects we're working on are both likely to see another phase, which likely means that we will see equivalent investment there, plus the other projects as well. So when I look at the overall pipeline, I feel pretty good about the quality of projects that we're pursuing, and the path to getting to that $8 to $10 billion of investments over the next few years looks pretty much intact.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Haynes\n\nEquity Research Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So it kind of looks like exiting the year, your EMEA margins are now like 200 basis points ahead of America's, maybe 100x the cost pass-through. So do you think your America's margins will gain ground in 2025?\nAnd then also, as a second piece of this, I think the gap is kind of widening versus APAC. So I was wondering if you could also kind of frame the opportunity there. Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Steven. So if you go back historically, about five years ago, many of you asked the same question when Americas' margins were leading, and I think APAC and EMEA were at 17% and 19%. And we had said then, and I want to repeat again today, that our business is homogeneous, and there is no impediment to getting to the highest margins we see anywhere in our business. The one thing I often point out when we have this conversation around margins is each one of our segments has a country or a business that has a margin with a full number in front of it.\nIn many ways, we encourage our businesses, each of the segments, to push and try and understand what those successful businesses with the 40+% margins are doing to ensure that we can bridge the gap. So to answer your question, both for Americas and APAC, my expectation remains that margins will continue to improve. And again, we've said in our prepared remarks earlier on, you should expect to see margin expansion in 2025 for Linde plc overall, which obviously is an aggregation of the different segments. I'd say to you that I'd probably say that that margin expansion range is between 20 to 50 basis points.\nTypically, that's what we expect longer term. Obviously, we've been delivering well in excess of that, and that obviously sets up some expectations. But expect margin expansion. Each of those segments will continue to grow margin.\nNo impediment to APAC bridging that gap. And of course, Americas has a solid business, which will continue to expand its margin as well.\n\nSteven Haynes\n\nEquity Research Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Good morning, guys. You talk about IP being your biggest KPI, which is fair. Roughly, what is the leverage if IP is up or down 1%? How much EPS does that generally drive for you? And then if you would, maybe just take a spin around the world. What are you seeing? IP and your guiding to flat is prudent, but where do you see potentials for things to be better or worse than that?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nDuffy, I'll let Matt talk a little bit about the IP correlation, and then I'll give you a walk around the world.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, Duffy.\nSo to start, as you probably know, we split our volumes into project and base, and our project volumes solely track our startup. So that is, as you know, completely independent of any IP or macroeconomic factor, and it's purely contractual based on the fixed element. So that one is part of the capital allocation contribution of the EPS algorithm. But to your point, when you think about base volumes, as Sanjiv mentioned, we have the rental, which is fixed regardless. That gets back to the resiliency of our model. As you recall, about 65% of our revenues are fairly resilient.\nBut of the molecules that they take, whether in the cylinder or whether in the tank for liquid, and to some extent over fixed fees in the pipe, that's just going to be a function of their production.\nSo from that end, that tends to best proxy to IP. And so I would say within the base volume piece, it aligns. Now, to your point, we tend to get higher IP leverage in developing countries where they are expanding more, which you'll look at as intensity of gas per capita. Whereas in more developed nations, it's closer to a one-to-one ratio you tend to see on the IP and the base volume tracked. So that's how I would think about that. When you look around the world, I think we can all agree that how some countries report IP is not equal in all countries.\nBut when we adjust for what we feel are a little bit of some noise in the numbers, what we've been seeing is IP close to zero, maybe tens of basis points, globally weighted in our businesses is what it's been ranging at.\nBut we'll have to see how it plays out going forward. I think EMEA, a drag, as you know. Americas has been pretty solid. I think China, depending upon which number you actually want to use, it can range anywhere from close to zero to the official number of 5%. That's how we would kind of see the IP. But I'll hand off to Sanjiv. Maybe he can give you a little walk around the world just with general color on trends.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Matt. So that's helpful in just kind of grounding you on how IP plays into our equation, but also how we think about it. Duffy, let me just walk you through the world. I think it's a question I'm sure it's on many people's minds. I'm going to try and break this down and parse it by two different perspectives.\nI'll start off with the markets that we have, the end markets, and use that as a characteristic to kind of define what we're expecting, and then talk about different geographies as well. So starting off with resilient end markets. By their very nature, you would expect them to grow, and therefore we expect low- to mid-single-digit growth in our resilient end markets driven primarily by electronics and food and beverage. The industrial sector, obviously most cyclical, impacted by industrial activity and demand, we do expect lower volumes there. Versus last year, we expect flat to low volumes, particularly in metals and chemicals.\nIf I now take the other perspective and talk about geographies, and I'm going to start off with maybe the Americas. Our expectation, low single-digit growth in the Americas across the resilient end markets.\nThe industrial sector also expected to be kind of flattish against what we see last year. I will specifically talk about the US, though. And in the US, I'd say to you, our current view remains, and I've said this before, right? US volumes and sales at a high watermark. Our expectation remains that in the first half of the year, they're likely to be flattish. That's what we're hearing from our customers. But towards the back end of the year, the second half for sure, we are expecting increased momentum across the US, and we'll see that play through in how we see the Americas volumes and growth activity come through.\nOn the other hand, a bit of a contrast, unfortunately, in Europe, we expect to see continued softening. This is primarily in Western Europe, also a little bit in Eastern Europe, but primarily in Western Europe.\nThe resilient end markets will continue to grow. There is a good trajectory there, and we'll expect that. But metals, manufacturing, chemicals, energy all expected to be softer and lower volumes versus previous year. So Europe, unfortunately, is a drag at the moment. Now, as far as Asia-Pacific is concerned, I'll start off with China because I know that's on a number of your minds. I was in China two weeks ago, spent a week with a team talking to our customers, meeting a number of CEOs, and getting a flavor of what I think is going to happen in China. And I think my short summary is, from our perspective, we don't expect anything significant in China in 2025.\nWe're not baking in any kind of recovery. I think industrial volumes and activity will remain stable, but flat, no recovery in any of those sectors.\nMetals and mining specifically is likely to be negative year on year for a number of reasons driven partly by demand, but equally by some large turnarounds that our customers are taking in the course of the year. So we'll kind of see that play in Q1 and Q2. But again, metals and mining, I'm likely to see any growth. The one sector in China that is growing today and will continue to grow is their electronics sector. A lot of energy and a lot of money has been put into that sector by the government as well. So we do expect that that'll play out and continue to see some level of growth.\nIf I was looking at China a bit more broadly, I'd say to you, two trends of particular note coming out of my visit.\nThe first, that the government has recognized the need for support if it's got to get personal private consumption and the property market to pick up. It said a lot of things. Not enough stimulus has gone into the market, so we haven't seen any improvements other than the fact that the last quarter you saw a bit of improvement from industrial activity for exports. We haven't really seen private consumption pickup happen. Now, there are all kinds of subsidies in place that they're putting out there. They're small, but hopefully they will have an impact over a period of time. I'd say to you, I wouldn't hold my breath for 2025 in terms of improvement.\nBeyond that, longer term, certainly we will see the China market stabilize and probably grow at a smaller pace than we're used to.\nBut certainly, we will expect to see growth come back. The rest of Asia-Pacific is largely flat versus previous year, except for India, which is obviously the growth story at the moment. And again, given our strong presence in India, we are making the most of it, winning more than our fair share, feel really good about where that's going. That's kind of a view around what we see across the world and expect in 2025.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Huang\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, David Huang here for Dave. What are your concerns, if any, of the Praxair or Linde playbook will be now employed at Air Products given the recent management change? I guess would that be a negative for Linde as they shift away from focusing too much on mega projects?\nCould that change result in an even more rational industry pricing environment?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nYeah, but I didn't get your question entirely, but I'm going to answer it anyway. Linde has a leadership position in the market because of a number of factors. I said in my prepared remarks, you cannot replicate, and I think Matt put it really nicely, you can try and copy, but you can never really duplicate what Linde has developed over many decades. And that's built into our operating rhythm. It's built into our performance culture. And more importantly, it is built into the networks that we have developed across the world where, because of the network density we have, we're able to get the margin improvements that we see and, of course, command the strength of the relationship with the customer and have the pricing power we have.\nThat's what's demonstrated in the margin expansion that you've consistently seen over the last five years. We will continue to work on that. What others will or won't work on really is a question you will need to address to them. But I think Linde is the market leader, and we will reflect that in the behaviors we put out there in the marketplace consistently.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nHead of Chemicals Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nYes, good morning, guys. I've got a question on healthcare where I think you've been around 0% organic growth every quarter in 2024. I was wondering if you could talk about what you've seen on price versus volumes, and if there's any specific area that is providing a big headwind. And I guess if you can expand into what you're thinking for 2025 for this one.\nThank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Laurent. You've heard me say this before, that in the healthcare space, we expect long-term kind of mid-single-digit growth, and that's what we would expect. Now, you know the healthcare sector is made up of two subsegments, if you like, the hospital care business, which is growing reasonably well and well on its way, and then obviously the home care business around the world, which tends to be moving forward as well. Now, we have, as you're aware from past calls, we've said that we were doing some portfolio rationalization in our home care business out of the US.\nIn many ways, what the numbers you're seeing at the moment are reflecting some of that rationalization that has been done in that Lincare business. That is moving forward well.\nAs you know, the home care business in particular, given the inflationary environment that we see, has to work really hard on productivity efforts. I'm happy to see that at Lincare, we are really seeing that progress being made. So it's looking pretty robust and resilient as things stand. At some stage, we will lap these portfolio actions, and you will see the long-term kind of low to mid-single-digit growth that we would expect from healthcare overall.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nHead of Chemicals Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you. If I can have a follow-up on the project side, you talked mostly about decarbonization-related projects that could be signed in the future. You didn't mention electronics. Is there a specific reason for that? I don't think we've seen significant new FIDs in electronics on your side over the last couple of years. Is this an area where we should be expecting new projects?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nLaurent, I'll only tell you that 20% of my all-time record sale of gas backlog is electronics. We are executing on electronics projects as we speak. I'm more than happy to tell you that we'll be announcing new wins very shortly as well. So I'm not sure whether that question really addressed a specific point, but I feel really good about electronics and our specific position in there. In fact, we took our board recently to our Phoenix facility, which serves TSMC, which you know has been a very successful project for TSMC. So I feel really good about it, executing a number of projects as we speak.\nThey're starting up and providing impact, and we continue to win more than our fair share.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nHead of Chemicals Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much.\nIn 2024, your cash flow from operations was up 1%, even though your EPS grew about 10%. Was that a depressed number? And so when you look at 2025 and your EPS growth of four to seven, is cash flow from operations going to grow higher or lower? And then secondly, in terms of market share in the overall industrial gas market, is market share pretty much constant for all of the major players? Or are you gaining share overall or losing share? Is there any share shift?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks. Jeff, I'll let Matt talk about the cash flows, and then we'll talk about the market.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYep. Yeah, Jeff. So on the OCF, to your point, yeah, we tend to look at EBITDA rates to OCF rates. So similar to what you're saying, but instead of EPS, EBITDA. And to your point, though, they should grow similarly.\nAnd the ratio we tend to always look to achieve on OCF to EBITDA is usually in the low 80s. And to your exact point, what we had occur over the last probably, I would say, 24 months, give or take, is this unwinding of our engineering portfolio as we worked out the sanctioned projects. And so what that created was you had a large influx of deposits of cash that stopped, and then we had to settle the payments to basically suppliers, and you had a very rapid acceleration of an unwind. So that created a large outflow of cash associated with the engineering business.\nAnd that's what created a slower growth of OCF relative to EBITDA because essentially what you had was some liabilities, which are the contract liabilities, if you look at that specific line, has been quite unfavorable.\nAnd what it is is these liabilities are unwinding on the wind down, but they're not cash generative. So that's why they create that unfavorable aspect on the working capital line that you see. So that is what's been driving this inability for the EBITDA and OCF to grow together. We've substantially gotten through all that in our engineering business. I expect 2025 to be a lot closer aligned on those growth rates. But normally, this is how the engineering percent completion business works. Normally, it's spread over a four-year build cycle, so you don't notice it.\nBut given the events of the sanctioned projects, it got compressed into a much tighter structure as we had to deal with the sanctioned projects.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Matt. Let me talk about market share. So actually, Jeff, to be honest, we don't spend a lot of time thinking and talking about market share.\nI think it's something that we can segment down and talk about specifics. That's what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to start off by just reminding you, record sale of gas backlog of $7+ billion, right? That's a good test of where market share is headed. To be honest, we're winning more than our fair share of those large projects, which are, as I'll remind you, and as we said in our prepared remarks, these are contracted growth with good solid terms and conditions, including termination, guaranteeing a minimal return on capital that is guaranteed.\nJust as a reminder, that very rigorous definition of backlog, where we are excelling today with our record backlog, kind of demonstrates on the larger project side how we are positioned in terms of market share.\nFor the merchant and package business, the concept of market share is less relevant. What is more important, and which is where we spend most of our time, is thinking about network density. Clearly, if you have network density, you are the leading player in that market, usually by a mile. It is very important to make sure that network density is what you drive through the decisions you make and in terms of how you manage your business on a day-to-day basis.\nI feel pretty good about the networks that we've developed and the strength of our market position in each one of those networks, which actually results in, as I said earlier, getting the margin expansion that we look for, and getting the market position, and the strength of our relationship with our customers because of those networks that we've developed.\nSo I'll just summarize by saying Linde remains a market leader, and we expect that leadership to continue to move forward given these elements that I just talked about.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. I was wanting to better understand the 59 small on-site wins, and maybe more specifically, how would you compare the contract terms of those small on-sites versus the large on-sites? I would assume these are long-term take-or-pay agreements. Some of them maybe even have your own employees on-site. So how would you compare the returns on these projects versus the big ones? And can you comment on what are the gases that are driving these small on-sites, i.e., is this oxygen for oxy-fuel, or is this hydrogen, et cetera? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThat's a fantastic question, Steve.\nAnd I really wanted somebody to raise it. So thanks for doing that. 59 long-term contracts. You would have read we signed 59 long-term contracts and are building 64 plants. All of this happened in the space of the last 12 months. So I feel really good about breaking that record. Now, let's talk about the profile of the small on-sites. I get excited about small on-sites because from so many different perspectives, they are actually a perfect way of generating annuity income for this business. And you can imagine this. Building 64 plants, we'll be starting off more than one plant a week to make sure that that revenue and cash generation happens.\nLet's talk about returns, terms and conditions, and the types of gases. So I think good to start with the types of gases.\nWe use both oxygen, nitrogen, and indeed, in the future, we expect to see electrolyzer-based hydrogen, which is currently not included in our definition for small on-site wins. But at some stage, we'll see that as a developing portfolio element to be added onto the small on-sites. Oxygen and nitrogen largely. Oxygen, I'll give you a great example. So we've been working with many customers. I'll take one Owens-Illinois, where we've been supporting them on their decarbonization efforts.\nAnd in this particular case, we have a piece of applications technology called OPTIMELT that we have developed, and we have deployed that successfully across a number of glass customers. Owens-Illinois being a good example of one of those, where we are able to do heat recovery, which allows them to get significant efficiencies, reduce natural gas consumption, and run the throughput of their furnaces at a significantly higher level.\nThat's a good example of small on-site, goes on-site and she provides that. We do the same with paper and pulp. We do the same with electronics, et cetera, which is where we would largely use nitrogen as an example. So both of these gases drive our small on-site portfolio and are kind of largely equally split between the different technologies that we apply and win. The terms of these small on-site contracts range between 10 and 15 years, exactly identical to what you would typically see on the large on-site piece.The terms and conditions are almost identical as well.\nSame fixed fee elements that we talk about, similar profile in terms of cash flows. What tends to happen, though, is that the execution timeline for these projects is much shorter. Typically, we'd be able to deploy a small on-site anywhere between nine to 15 months.\nAs you know, the large on-site projects or the larger projects that we do tend to take longer in terms of their construction commissioning period. So again, a very, very nice piece. Often on the small on-sites, we're able to de-risk the execution as well because the execution or a portion of the civils is carried out by the customer. And again, it helps us both implement and construct quickly, but also have the customer take the risk around the civils piece as well. That brings me in the end to returns. And our returns typically for small on-sites are above what we would see on average for some of the large projects. So I feel really good about the returns, highly accretive to our portfolio.\nAgain, you've been seeing over the last four or five years, we've put a lot of focus on developing this part of the portfolio and are really seeing the benefits of that in these 59 long-term contracts we signed and the 64 plants we're building up. All in, I think really a good part of the portfolio we have. Very excited about it.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Bank of America)\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, this is Abigail on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. This was sort of touched on earlier in the call, but I wondered if you could just clarify the contributions from pricing versus productivity and cost management when we're talking about forward-looking guidance for the quarter and for the year. Thanks.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nHey, Abby. It's Matt.\nSo we don't split that out, but as Sanjiv mentioned earlier. So we've got 10+% in the combination of the capital allocation contribution and the management action contribution. And for purposes of guidance, I'd say roughly split 50/50, just say 5% at this stage. Historically, management actions have been the larger contribution, but we always need and want to think about that as a spread, right? To think about one in isolation to us doesn't make a lot of sense because you'll see very different inflation levels in different countries.\nSo the local spread of price to cost inflation is a critical metric for us because that positive spread is what's part of the compound value creation of the model. So I would say it's a very, very local discussion, but the spread needs to remain positive.\nThat's a big component of the margin expansion, the long-term margin expansion as well. But I'd say for purposes of the guidance right now, just assume it's roughly half from management actions of the 10% and half from capital allocation of the 10%, so 5% and 5%. And as Sanjiv mentioned, we're obviously going to continue to take actions to try and improve on that, but that's what's laid out in the guidance at this stage.\n\n[Analyst] (Bank of America)\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nChemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So a question around the $10 billion backlog between Sale of Gas and Sale of Equipment.\nHow much of the equipment at this point is locked in where we don't have to worry about tariffs or maybe the benefit of the strong dollar, and how much of it is there a little bit of exposure on? How should we be thinking about that?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, John. So again, as you said, $10 billion in backlog, about $3.1 or $3.2 of that sits in the SOE side, the Sale of Equipment side, and the balance $7 billion plus sitting in the Sale of Gas side. So as far as tariffs are concerned, obviously, we've been looking at the portfolio. On the SOE side, our contractual protection typically takes care of that. So we go in with firm pricing with our contractors, and wherever necessary, we'd have contractual protection to make sure that events like tariffs, et cetera, get adequately covered.\nOn the sale of gas side, where we're doing a lot of the procurement, we're obviously managing and tracking that quite closely. We did that study recently for US projects, and actually, the impact of the tariffs is de minimis. So really, we are not seeing any impact there. Now, our experience of the past has been, and there have been tariffs for a while now, including the first round of the administration a few years ago when we dealt with this. One of the things we found was when tariffs did get introduced, typically, they didn't really impact our firm offers that we put in on the procurement cycle.\nBut also more importantly, we got some benefit typically out of devaluation of currencies that more than offset the tariff impact if there was impact of any significance.\nSo all in, I'd say to you, we've looked at tariffs. It's part of what we've done in the past, and we kind of managed it adequately. At this point in time, we feel pretty good about where our projects stand.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nChemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Clark\n\nHead of Global Chemicals Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nYes, good morning, everyone. I got kicked off, so I hope I don't ask something that's been asked before. But I'm not terribly surprised with the guidance, but maybe I was a bit off on the forex. And using the sales line, I get slightly lower, but I'm assuming you've got some very profitable markets in there that are being hit very hard with the currency. I'm thinking Mexico, maybe Brazil a bit. Just wondering if there's an element of that in that guidance.\nAnd then allied to that, the tariff risk. I know gases don't travel. I know it's mostly for customers in the region. But again, some of these very profitable markets are ones at risk in terms of tariffs. And again, Mexico would be a classic in terms of that. Just how you think around that as well. Thank you.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde",
    "content2": "Hey, Peter. It's Matt. So we'll start on the FX. Yeah, you actually hit on the two bigger ones. Brazil and Mexico were the larger ones. I would say if you think about the evolution of FX through 2024, some of the European-based currencies, as you probably know, were almost quite favorable to flat in the beginning of 2024. But unfortunately, what you were seeing were a lot of LATAM currencies devalue fairly materially.\nThe Mexican peso being one, the Brazilian real, and then Argentinian peso, as you can imagine, which is on a managed devaluation, which uses hypercurrency inflation. So the LATAM currencies were probably seeing more of the brunt in the first half to two-thirds of the year. But what we saw in Q4, just given some of the geopolitical and political events, was a significant flight to the dollar. I think DXY index is probably the best indicator of that. If you sort of look at DXY right around the beginning or prior to the US elections to where it ended in the year, it appreciated almost 10%.\nAnd I think you gave a pretty good indication of the six major basket currencies of which that index is comprised of, how much those major currencies you saw that move.\nSo that was, I would say, was a two-stage impact on the rates. And then what that ended up with was some of the more larger currencies like the euro, the sterling, and the Aussie dollar, et cetera, really devalued in the back half of the Q4. So I'd say that was the dynamic we saw. It'll be what it'll be, right? Well, obviously, as we mentioned, you book on the average rate each month, and then we'll see if the devaluations do create inflationary aspects. I think Sanjiv had mentioned the tariffs. And as you could imagine, our impact on the tariffs is really indirect.\nSince we're so localized, to your point, we don't have much direct impact. Sanjiv mentioned the equipment, which is small, and that tends to self-correct.\nSo it really just comes down to a function of the customers that we supply and what production levels they have. Given our leading density positions in a lot of these economies, we feel quite good that we are there to capture where the products move to. Because I think at the end of the day, what you have to ask yourself with these tariffs is, is production shifting, or will there be a reduction of production? But in a shifting basis, we feel quite good we'll capture where it goes. And if there is a net reduction, the question will be from where. So time will tell on that, but this is more going to be a function of that IP we talked about, and we'll see how it plays out.\nBut given the guide we gave on basically a zero IP at the midpoint, we'll have to see how things play out on that.\n\nPeter Clark\n\nHead of Global Chemicals Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. Just on the step-up in CapEx for 2025, is most of that being driven by the two large projects, and is this step-up from those projects more meaningful in 2026 as well? Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nPatrick, we just referenced the Sale of Gas backlog being an all-time high at $7.1 billion. Clearly, that's the reason why you're seeing the step-up in CapEx. And obviously, sitting within that are the two large projects that we're executing around the clean energy piece, but also a number of electronics projects, et cetera. So that is really, that's all that's driving the CapEx number as things stand.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nYeah, thank you. Your competitor had a large non-recurring helium sale in the quarter. Did that take down industry helium prices, or how would you characterize the helium market?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nJohn, I think the helium market continues to display exactly the characteristics that we've been seeing for most of 2024, in fact. As I look at the helium market today, I'd say to you that there are parts of the world where helium is long. Asia is one of them. As you know, about a third of all the imports into China are coming out of Russia, which obviously has unbalanced that market to some extent. Demand side on helium remains flattish.\nWe see some softness around electronics and maybe MRI, but that tends to kind of pick up during the course of the year. Pricing, as things stand, remains stable. We're not seeing any significant movements on pricing. Corrections had happened, as you know, about a year, 18 months ago. There's nothing unexpected happening. You're referencing a transaction that I won't comment on at this stage, but there are shifts in helium supply and demand all the time. There is nothing new happening over here that would impact the market itself.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Horan\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nHi, this is Matt Horan for Kevin McCarthy. Regarding the new CCS hub in Jubail, could you provide more details on the scope and structure of your investment in the project? How large is the investment?\nDo you see this project being foundational in nature in that it could turn into a base hub for additional follow-on investments with the goal of increasing regional asset density?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Matt. Essentially, I'm going to give you a high-level view of the project. It hasn't gone to FID. When it does, you will hear us talk a bit more about it. Essentially, it's a three-way joint venture that is developing, which will be, in its first phase, a very large CCS project in Saudi. The three partners are led by Saudi Aramco, SLB, and Linde, each kind of contributing their skill set into that project. The first phase of that project is between nine to 11 million tons per annum of CO2 being sequestered. There is an expectation that there will be two more phases.\nBy the end of the third phase, when it gets completed, this could well be the world's largest CCS project at 54 or 53 million tons per annum of CO2 being captured and sequestered. So yes, there is potential for growth beyond. Obviously, we will assess those phases when they happen. At this point in time, this joint venture structure is developing the project. The feed has been completed. The capital is being assessed as we speak, so I'm not going to give you a firm number just yet. I expect FID in the next few months, and once that happens, you'll get a lot more detail around it.\nBut it is a fairly significant project with some exceptional partners in a part of the world where Linde will strengthen its position, and obviously, there will be a future opportunity to continue to grow with this.\nAlongside this project, we will also look at developing a blue hydrogen project, which would leverage the CCS infrastructure that has been developed in this project. But again, when that goes to FID in due course and meets our investment criteria, and we have a project worth talking about, you'll hear us talk a bit more about that.\n\nMatt Horan\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now take our final question from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nDan Rizzo\n\nSenior Vice President and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, this is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. I was just wondering what your view is on the depth of the pipeline of potential hydrogen projects, particularly in the EU and Japan.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSo I said this earlier, and I'm going to maybe just quickly recap my earlier comments and then talk specifically about the markets you've mentioned.\nSo we have seen that people are being more rigorous and applying more diligence before they take on FID decisions for these large projects. When I think about our pipeline and the context of that, I feel really good about the strength of the high-quality projects we have in our pipeline that we are developing. We're developing those projects, as you would expect, in the US, in Canada, so in North America, in the Middle East, largely in Saudi Arabia, but also potentially in Emirates, in Europe, particularly with partners like Equinor, where potentially we have an opportunity to provide low-carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen into the European network.\nThen we are looking at some projects in Asia which are localized for local markets.\nYour specific question around Europe and Japan, I would say to you that the projects in Japan are minimal, other than the fact that Japan is a very important market from an import perspective, that they would want to import in either clean hydrogen or derivatives such as ammonia or methanol into their market for a host of applications that they've determined are needed for their decarbonization efforts. So everybody's looking at Far East from a point of ability to export into that market, which is why it remains an important market, alongside Japan, as well as Korea, as well. But the development itself in Japan, I think, is minimal.\nAs far as Europe is concerned, obviously, you see a lot of discussion around clean hydrogen in Europe, including green and including blue and so on and so forth.\nThe reality is the regulatory framework is so difficult that to be able to get to a decision point on a very large substantive investment requires a lot of time. And I think we're seeing that play out in Europe as things stand, which is why there is a real fear that the European aspirations for the amount of hydrogen they need for that market will not be entirely met because the combination of the time to kind of decipher the regulatory framework and to make investment decisions in this environment is obviously a little more challenging.\n\nDan Rizzo\n\nSenior Vice President and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nAbby, thank you. And thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out directly. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded, and after the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nAdam, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our Q2 2024 Earnings Call Webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer, and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's Q2 financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone. Linde employees once again delivered high quality growth despite the stagnant trends of global industrial activity. Q2 EPS of $3.85, operating margins of 29.3%, and return on capital of 25.7% all reached new highs driven by the unwavering efforts of our 66,000 employees who actively manage what we can control.\nTurning to volume trends, you'll notice we were flat year on year. Last quarter we described potential challenges in the industrial macro, and for the most part it has played out as expected. This is why we initiated the self-help actions which enable us to create shareholder value in any environment. That being said, the current quarter experienced a 3% sequential volume growth, and while some of this relates to seasonality, certain regions had organic volume improvements. While this is a positive sign, we're still not assuming any meaningful economic recovery in the guidance.\nSome may view this as overly cautious, but given the uncertain environment, I believe it's prudent to take this approach. As you know, when industrial activity recovers, our network density will enable us to supply that additional volume to our existing and new customers. Until then, we will continue with disciplined pricing and proactive actions to ensure earnings growth in this environment. Slide three provides more color on end market growth trends.\nStarting with consumer related end markets. Food and beverage continues the strong resilient growth trend at 8% over prior year, in part attributed to Linde's total systems approach. This includes growing demand for higher quality and more innovative frozen foods, food packaging safety, and dry ice for meal delivery services as consumers opt for convenience meals. In addition, beverage carbonation and associated services continue to grow as consumers dine out.\nOur electronics sales represent 9% of our consolidated sales, but there's a substantial portion of our 50% non-consolidated JVs that supply this end market and are not included in this number. Primarily in Taiwan. The 7% growth sequentially and year-over-year was driven by a combination of project backlog startups and base growth in the US and Asia. In the US, we started up our Phase 1 supply system in Phoenix, Arizona for TSMC. Due to this, more than half of this project CapEx has now been removed from the backlog, driving the slight net decline versus prior quarter. I've always said that a healthy project backlog is one that turns over frequently with projects starting on time contributing to earnings as per contract.\nIn addition, base volumes improved moderately in the US, China, and Korea. As you know, from the last quarter we signaled this was possible, so I'm encouraged to see volume levels starting to recover now. Healthcare is down 1% from prior year and flat sequentially consistent with last quarter. This is primarily due to our efforts to continue rationalizing home care products and service offerings that don't meet the business criteria, especially in the United States. We still anticipate the underlying demographic trend to drive mid single digit percent growth, but some of the ongoing portfolio pruning will partially offset that.\nTurning now to the industrial end markets, chemicals and energy grew 5% from North American activity, primarily in the US Gulf Coast hydrogen, as well as Mexican energy services. We supply some of the most cost competitive customers in the world, and their higher production rates reflect their share of the global market. Looking forward to this end market will likely be the largest beneficiary of the project backlog, especially around clean energy projects. While OCI represents just one example, there are several more that comprise the $8 to 10 billion of near-term pipeline opportunities which we are pursuing and making good progress.\nMetals and mining is slightly down year-over-year, mainly from North American steel volumes, which have decreased, primarily serving the automotive and construction markets. This is a normal cycle we've seen over the years, not unexpected, although there could be some future growth opportunities as more infrastructure and energy projects break ground. Finally, the manufacturing end market is trending up 4% primarily on pricing actions as volumes are fairly steady across most geographies. Aside from some specific manufacturing sectors like aerospace or battery production, this end market mostly coincides with global industrial production which remains flat.\nOverall, Linde employees continue to do what they do best, manage an industrial gas business with leading results that create value for our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. Despite the challenging conditions, Linde delivered high quality growth, executed on 8 billion project backlog, and further positioned the company for future growth. I remain confident in Linde's ability to successfully navigate the near-term uncertainty while ensuring longer-term leading performance that our owners expect. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Slide four provides consolidated results for the Q2. Sales of $8.3 billion were up 1% from last year and 2% sequentially. Foreign currency and cost pass-through both continue to present headwinds at -3% year-over-year and -2% from the Q1. As a reminder, contractual cost pass-through is simply the energy cost variance we bill to on-site customers and thus has no impact to operating profit dollars. Furthermore, FX translation likely will remain a headwind as the US dollar continues to strengthen against the majority of foreign currencies.\nExcluding these items, organic sales are up 3% over last year and 4% sequentially. Pricing trends continue to follow globally weighted inflation with the strongest contribution from Americas, and EMEA. APAC levels are more stable as lower helium prices mostly offset increases from the remaining countries with no contribution from China due to deflationary conditions. Volume was flat from 2023 as growth from the project backlog was offset by weaker base volumes. As Sanjiv mentioned, we did experience a sequential volume improvement of 3% from a combination of project startups, organic growth, and seasonality. Time will tell if the organic growth trend persists, but for now we are excluding any further improvement in the earnings guidance.\nOperating profit of $2.4 billion grew 6% resulting in an operating margin of 29.3%. All gas segments expanded margins year-over-year and sequentially with EMEA leading at 33.7%. As we stated many times, each segment has opportunities to improve margins, and there are no structural reasons why laggards cannot converge to the current leader over time. EPS of $3.85 increased 8% or 10% when excluding the 2% FX headwind. Further details of cash flow and capital allocation can be found on slide five.\nYou can see the operating cash flow trend to the left, including this quarter's $1.9 billion, which is 10% below last year. The primary driver relates to unfavorable timing of our engineering project prepayments. When you look at the face of the cash flow statement, you can see that contract assets and liabilities, which represents these project prepayments, are unfavorable more than $300 million. This quarter to quarter volatility is a normal part of the engineering project cycle.\nAside from the engineering projects, we are seeing more seasonal effects on interest and tax payments. We have significantly more Eurobond cash payments which are once per year as well as cash tax payments in the first half of the year. This will result in more back end loaded operating cash flow similar to last year. Overall, I remain quite confident on cash generation of the gas business, but I do expect continued volatility regarding timing of customer prepayments for engineering projects. As far as capital allocation year to date, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders and invested $2.3 billion into the business.\nRegardless of the economic climate, we'll continue to adhere to our time-tested capital policy of an underlying mandate to maintain a single A credit rating while raising the dividend every year, a priority to invest back into the business subject to our long-term investment criteria, and a commitment to sweep remaining funds towards stock repurchases. I'll wrap up with guidance on slide six. For Q3 we're providing an EPS guidance range of $3.82 to 3.92 or 6% to 9% growth when excluding a 1% FX headwind consistent with prior quarters. This assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint.\nThe updated full year range is now $15.40 to 15.60 or 9% to 11% growth when excluding a 1% FX headwind for the full year. We simply raised the prior guidance range by $0.10 on the bottom end while leaving the top end. As is consistent with statements last quarter, we have not seen enough encouraging signs to be bullish on the second half economic activity, so we are essentially leaving the guide intact while raising the bottom end for our recent Q2 performance. Rest assured, if the economy does better, we will capture that incremental benefit. And if it does worse, we will take actions to mitigate the impact to earnings. Here at Linde, we have a culture to plan for the worst but hope for the best. Employees around the world have been taking proactive measures to ensure we can deliver on our commitments regardless of the economy.\nThis disciplined operating rhythm, coupled with our relentless focus to create shareholder value, gives us confidence to once again weather the uncertainty and maintain industry-leading results. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Leithead at Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning guys. Big picture question. When we look at your results and your peers, it doesn't seem like there's much industrial gas demand out there right now. Linde's done a great job the past few years of continuing to grow earnings double digits despite that, in large part, some of the self-help actions you've taken. I guess if we're stuck in this no growth environment for a bit here near term and we're already at a pretty efficient baseline, can you just talk through your confidence and how you expect to continue driving 10+% earnings growth just in this macro backdrop?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks Mike. You're right. I think the macro isn't really very supportive at this point in time. What I'd like to suggest is, you go back maybe four or five quarters. Now, we've seen the macro environment reflect that. In fact, over that period, we've seen what I call industrial recession. While people debate around what the GDP does or doesn't, we are very focused on what the industrial production index is doing, and we've seen industrial recession over that period, and we've managed right through that to not only deliver that EPS growth that you just referenced, but also consistently ensure that our organization is ready to take the actions ahead of the curve in most cases. As we see these indices, one of the good things we have is our ability to see across different end markets and geographies and to take action quickly.\nSo I think that in part is the reason we are where we are today. Delivering on that EPS growth consistently over an extended period of time. My view is that is exactly the MO that you would expect from us going forward as well. It's something that we have understood well. It's a muscle that we know how to flex well, and I think you'll see that play out. I'll take you right to the EPS algorithm that we've spoken about a lot in the past, Mike. And I think that's what gives us confidence that we will be able to continue to provide that 10+% EPS growth through most economic environments, if not all. So I'll recap that for you. There are four contributors to how we get to that 10+% EPS growth.\nThe first backlog. That backlog and the startups that are happening. And you know, we've been consistent in starting up the backlog. Those startups contribute anywhere between 1% to 2% of IPA's growth. Backlog is trending up, and I expect to see that 1% to 2% contribution to trend up alongside that. The next factor is what we are, you know, what we practice every day. This is pricing and productivity. We've explained this in a lot of detail to you guys. I won't kind of recap all of it, but to say that we expect about more than half of that EPS growth to come from proactive management actions related to pricing and productivity. So about 4% to 6% of that EPS growth comes and contributed from pricing and productivity. Next, volume. Obviously at this point in time you've heard us say that our guidance has zero volume assumed at the midpoint.\nSo if there is a volume uptick, even a little bit of a tailwind on industrial activity, obviously we will pick that up. There's a multiplier effect that you've seen. We've demonstrated that in 2021 we constantly remind people that even with a little bit of a rebound on the industrial side, we were able to deliver 30% EPS growth in that year. But in the absence of that, our algorithm still suggests with zero contribution, we will continue to deliver that 10+% EPS growth. Last but not least, we have a lot of cash that we generate. Surplus cash after investing in the business is swept into share buybacks and they contribute about 2% of that EPS growth. Put that together, that 10+% EPS growth I can say with a high degree of confidence is where we stand in terms of our business for this year and going forward.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning, Sanjiv and Matt. The sequential volume growth of 3% in the quarter was positive. The volume comparison in Q3 is not hard, maybe even easy at -2%. So why wouldn't we see volume growth for Linde in Q3 year-over-year?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nHey David, it's Matt. I think to your exact point, we absolutely see the comps getting easier in the back half. So on a year-over-year basis, you might see neutral to positive, just because the prior year comps a little easier. But our view of no macro improvement that we're laying out is more on a sequential basis. So to your exact point, even if you see little to no macro improvement sequentially, it still could result in, you know, potentially neutral to positive year on year just because of the comps that you're, you're up against. So the comps do get easier in the back half. That's absolutely correct on a year-over-year basis. But we're taking our standard approach, which is on a forward looking sequential basis. Assume no economic pickup, and then we'll just need to manage to the reality of whatever happens, good or bad.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust one more question. The order intake was the lowest, I think since Q2 2020 at $300 million. I know it's lumpy, but is bidding activity lower or less than it was six or 12 months ago?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nDavid, our folks in engineering are very busy, and there is a lot of front-end work currently that is happening around studies, feeds, and so on and so forth. We're seeing activity at the front end being very, very busy. What we aren't seeing at the moment. The delay tends to be moving from that front end activity, which is whether it's a feed or a study, to actually getting to FID. And we certainly see customers taking a little bit longer to getting to that FID piece. So a lot of activity isn't translating just yet to FIDs. We've said this before the last call as well. We are seeing people taking a little more time before they get to an FID decision on some of these large projects.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Chemicals, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Good morning, guys. Can we dig in a little bit on health care? You know, again, traditionally you think about health care kind of growing year in and year out a little bit. How much pruning do you have left? Roughly how much of the portfolio needs to go away? When do you think that's done? And then when you get to that mid-single digits, what's the breakdown of that price versus volume? And can you recoup inflation in that business like you can in your other businesses?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nAll right, Duffy, so let me first explain what's happening the pruning, then we'll talk a little bit about how the growth around healthcare happens. So as far as pruning is concerned, we have been looking at that portfolio. We've been acting on it. You've heard us speak about it in the last quarter. Those actions continue. My expectation is by the end of the year you'll see some of those actions getting lapped out. So that's what you should be thinking about long term, mid to long term. I'd say demographics will support that mid-single digit expectation of health care growth. We see that currently on par. And that demographics obviously drive both the hospital care, which is obviously a large part of our business, as well as the home care business which is in some selected geographies where we operate.\nAs far as inflation is concerned, this is a business that relies enormously on productivity actions and therefore we always find that inflation and productivity will have to go hand in hand for us to get the pricing that we need and keep that business at an attractive margin level.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Chemicals, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Peter Clark with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Clark\n\nHead of Global Chemicals Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nYes, good morning, everyone. Two questions, but sort of one related. It's on the ExxonMobil contract that Air Liquide announced. Obviously one of the things that they're getting to the return hurdle is the big ramp in Argon merchant where they're claiming 50% increase in their merchant availability. I know it's not quite fit. I know it could be four years plus away, but what sort of impact could that have just in the market?\nI know Argon's been tight, but it's quite a slug of capacity that would come pretty quickly. And related to that, obviously part of that deal, they're allowing access to the pipelines. They probably got capability to do that. I think you're probably sold out a bit more than them on your Gulf Coast pipelines. Is that something you would consider in some regions access to pipeline for the right sort of contract? Those are the two questions. Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThank you, Peter. So, as you know, the US market is one of our largest merchant markets and therefore there is current growth in demand on the demand side, in fact, we are actually putting in some capacity as well. And we see the market remaining short on argon for an extended period of time. From my perspective, obviously what Air Liquide has done with their economics is something you need to ask them. But from our perspective, it's a stable market. There is growth in the market, the molecules get absorbed fairly quickly. Our view of the market continues to be fairly bullish and I expect product as it comes on will get placed in the market at a reasonable pace. As far as pipeline access is concerned, I'll just give you our view.\nI'm not going to try and comment on what the strategy or the view from might be from our perspective. We have over a period of maybe three or four decades now developed a very significant pipeline network that underpins significantly the kind of business and growth that we've developed in the US Gulf Coast. We see that pipeline network as being critical to continue to deliver growth through that very network in that very exciting part of the world where we see growth, particularly as it's driven in the future with low carbon hydrogen developments as well. For us, in many ways our competitive advantage lies in the infrastructure that we've invested in and developed over three decades. We want to fully leverage that infrastructure as we did with the OCI project, to make sure that we continue to win and actually grow that business significantly.\nI remain very bullish on the opportunities I see in the US Gulf Coast and I see us developing and actually developing that infrastructure further. Building further caverns as an example is something that we are progressing with and using that for future growth.\n\nPeter Clark\n\nHead of Global Chemicals Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nThank you. You didn't surprise me with your answers.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThat's good, Peter. Consistency is what we strive for.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning. I don't ordinarily think of your business as being interest rate sensitive, but we have had an unprecedented increase in rates in a short period of time, and now it seems like we're pivoting to a decrease in rates. So, wondering just what your thoughts are on if we assume rates come down over the balance this year and through next year. Will that change your macro-outlook at all, and do you think it will change your customers' behavior in terms of their ability or desire to move forward in FID projects that they would work with you on?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nVince, I'm going to let Matt talk to you about this. It's a topic he's very passionate about, and then I'll maybe add to that. Go ahead, Matt.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nHey Vince. Thanks Sanjiv. You know, obviously, as you know Vince, it's speculation at this point, nobody knows for certain, but obviously we have an opinion like everyone else. And to your point, I mean my, my personal opinion on this is, you know, as interest rates rose rapidly, the area that was affected most were large durable goods, large capital deployments. So our customers that may enter into that area, even when you think about something like the consumer, home loans, auto loans, those in some cases effectively doubled and changed the dynamic on that purchasing power of those more durable goods which tend to have more plastics in them, more metals, more glass, cement, the kind of more industrial infrastructure you tend to see.\nTherefore, I think this, in my opinion, was a driver of the very weak industrial production PMI numbers you've seen over the last 18+ months. As Sanjiv mentioned to some extent, in many countries in the world we've been in an industrial recession. I believe those customers that were affected by that were the more interest rate sensitive. I think on top of that you add, I would argue, probably a little bit less government infrastructure spend than what you normally see because a lot of it was tied up more in various incentive packages that needed a lot of clarity. So that clarity, lack of clarity, stretched these out. Conversely, the consumer was stronger throughout that time in non-interest sensitive areas of consumption.\nServices. But at least based on what I'm seeing now, it seems like that aspect of the consumer is starting to slow. In theory, what's possible, maybe you start to see GDP contract, which then would actually define a real recession. And at that point to your exact point, if interest rates decline, hopefully what that could do is thaw out some of the durables, some of the larger capital-intensive purchases, and start to help that environment. Because what we're seeing today on some of these projects, the customers are committed, they want to do it, but the CapEx costs are high and I think that's a function of the inflation, that's a function of the rates working their way through.\nIf that were to reverse, it could probably bring a little more stability and a little more reasonable pricing, which I think could cause some projects to finally clear the FID and sign the contract. It's speculative, right? Nobody knows for certain, but that's how I would at least view it at this state and I would view it as positive with the lower rates to try and move some of these projects over the final signature hurdle.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nSenior Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you. Good morning, all. My question is around electronics. Sanjiv, you mentioned the TSMC startup and I was thinking that we haven't seen any announcements of new projects in electronics in a while. I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity from here for new projects and also if there's anything you can see or say on the incremental opportunity from AI and data centers. Thank you.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Laurent. Both of those questions are excellent, and something that we kind of referenced in the last call. Just saying that, look, we were seeing a buildup of some early signals around a recovery in electronics. I'd say to you that we have seen that in the course of the quarter, but these are early signals. There is still more to happen in the course of the balance of this year. Let's talk a little bit about projects now. We started off Phase 1 of TSMC in Phoenix. We are very advanced in our build on the Samsung project in Taylor, Texas, and we're building a number of other plants, some for Intel around the world as well. We also see growth going back in terms of the Asian demand.\nWe're also seeing growth in the Asian demand starting to pick up and new projects getting announced there as well. So over time as these projects get signed up and contracted, as you know, we have a very high level of discipline around what we will announce, but you will see announcements reflecting a number of these investments that we would make as those contracts get signed out. I expect electronics will continue to see momentum in terms of new investments, new fab capacity. And to your point, this will be driven in part by large data requirements, also driven by AI requirements. I know AI have the hype, the shine's off a little bit at the moment. But the reality is AI will prove to be a tool that will be significantly and, in some cases, transformative for industries and markets.\nAnd you will see investment underpinning that coming through data centers, helped and supported then by chip production that happens out of the fabs. I still expect that that momentum will be there. I still expect the large major semiconductor manufacturers to continue to make that investment. Obviously, there are some that are kind of seeing some short-term challenges, including some news today that you would have seen. But the long-term outlook remains very robust, and we continue to be very well positioned to win more than our fair share in that space.\n\nLaurent Favre\n\nSenior Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. Matt. You mentioned in your remarks about challenges in helium in your APAC business. Just curious whether that is stabilizing or do you see further erosion in either pricing or volumes there? And perhaps, more broadly. Can you talk about your helium fundamentals in the other regions? Are they quite different from the impact from this Russian supply? And what exactly is the portion that is in your corporate segment? I assume that's some kind of export volume. Perhaps you can highlight what exactly is the driver there.\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nSure, Steve. I think on a couple things just for some baseline data. So, helium is low single-digit percent of our global sales, just to put in perspective the component that it makes up for us. Furthermore, to your point, helium is one of the very, very few molecules that is truly global pricing supply-demand driven. As you know, the vast majority of our projects, our products price to inflation contractually. But helium is a difference as it is more supply-demand driven, given the nature of that molecule. So, with that as the backdrop, I think to your point, you are seeing different regional aspects of pricing, with APAC seeing the most pressure from this Russian supply. Now, we have no participation in that Russian supply. We are not using Russian supply. We canceled that contract per our allowance a couple years ago.\nSo from that perspective, it is finding its way primarily into China. But as you can imagine, APAC is a larger consumer of helium, primarily because of the electronics sector. So given the electronics sector in certain parts, especially like Korea, may be a little slower, coupled with this Russian supply, it definitely created some pricing pressure. I would say now it is stabilizing, but it's something you still got to keep an eye on. But the way we always think about this, and it's been true in this business going back decades, is you have to have a significant diversity of supply. You have to have all supply modes to move the molecules and you have to have a very robust global business across all end markets. And when you have all those things, it gives you much more stability and a healthy business.\nThat always has been the case for us, and I expect it will always continue to be the case. As far as the helium component of the other segment, just to clarify what that is. So given helium is more of a global business, we sell it intercompany to all of the gas segments since we operated as a single global business. So the intercompany transfer pricing aspect is what we show in the other segment. So that'll just be at a cost plus transfer price that's eliminated. And the actual majority of the helium profit will be represented in each of the gas segments. So it tends to be somewhat stable, with the one exception that, as you see swings in the cost of helium up or down, that will reflect more in the other segment. Whereas pricing dynamics tend to reflect more in the gas segments, the geographic gas segments for the end market pricing. So that's how to think about that, just as in terms of how we structured our segments.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nVery helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMy next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Just curious, Sanjiv, if you think about the ISM and stuff, it didn't look really great the last couple days. What if things get worse sequentially into the third and the fourth? How do you think your portfolio or strategy will change? And how does that sort of change the maybe order backlogs and stuff? Thanks.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nAll right, Mike, so maybe I'll break that up into a couple of different conversations. Let's talk about the business itself. I think you'll recall, Mike, we had a conversation a few quarters ago when we described the profile of our business as being defensive. I think in that, in doing that we'd explain that a combination of factors ensures that we have the robustness and the resilience that sits in the business portfolio that we have. So part of that we said was obviously our contracted on-site business. As we've seen through some difficult, you know, the period of energy crisis in Europe, as an example, that's held really well, contracts have been honored. I think that that defensiveness of that and the resilience, you know, has shown through in many ways.\nSo that's one part of, you know, that defensive nature of our business. The other is the resilient end markets that we supply, which are not prone to manufacturing, PMIs, and so on and so forth. Being food and beverage, again, you saw that 8% year on year growth in food and beverage. I expect to see continued growth in that segment as well. In addition to that, health care, which we are now kind of sorting out some of the portfolio issues, but underlying health care, mid single digit growth expectations going forward, that resilience will continue to be there, again secular in many ways of what happens to manufacturing and industrial activity. So that portion of supplies to the resilient business. Add to that we have contracted rental streams that come in in respect again of activity levels.\nIf all of that together, you've got a business where nearly 3/4 of our business is contracted in or locked in through these various mechanisms, giving that defensive nature, irrespective of what happens to the industrial activity and manufacturing PMI that everyone's referencing at the moment, the reality is that defensive nature will continue to be very resilient as we move forward.\nThe other part of your question was what happens to backlog, right? And again, I just want to say backlog at $7.9 billion, you know, we're working our way through that. We're starting up this year between $1.5 and 2 billion worth of projects. In the first half itself, more than about half of that's already been done. So that backlog is contracted growth. Usually it's, you know, it's date certain. So irrespective of what is happening with the customer's project, we get a stream of revenues through that project coming through. And you know, we see that as a very robust part of, you know, our future growth plans, which are locked in and contracted. And we feel really good about the quality of that backlog that we're currently executing.\nAs I said before, backlog, you know, is, as an example, this quarter itself, we started up the TSMC Phase 1 project and that's going to start contributing to earnings based on the contracts that we have. So again, a very resilient part of that. So I think you look at that; I think that kind of gives you a flavor of what we're looking ahead to in terms of how we think about the resilience underpinning the business.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director and Chemicals Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about pricing specifically in the Americas. I think it's been a source of strength for you guys and some of your competitors that have reported. So just curious, one, if that's more of a US phenomenon or if that's more South or Central America where you're getting more pricing. And two, I guess with energy prices, semi stable demand, kind of semi stable, what's driving some of that sequential acceleration in pricing within the region? Thanks.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThanks, Josh. So again, I think pricing is, and we've said this a number of times before, Josh. I'm just going to maybe go back and recap that very briefly. We've said if you go back and look at the long-term pricing trend, we track or are slightly ahead of globally weighted CPI. For us, that trend has been consistent over an extended period. I go back 15, 20 years; we've demonstrated positive pricing across that period aligned with what we think global CPI has done. And that is actually a great proxy to think about how we continue to see pricing going forward. So I want to just as you're thinking about pricing and as you're looking ahead, I want you to just keep that in mind because that I think in truth is really where our pricing efforts will continue to yield results going forward.\nNow, pricing continues to be robust in the Americas. I think we are seeing positive pricing both in the US as well as in our Latin American businesses. And this again, the trend itself is not inconsistent. It's a trend that we've been able to, you know, we have seen through the course of the last many quarters and in fact consistently proven over the last five years as well. So again, there's nothing happening over there that's exceptional. All we're doing is management action drives pricing is how we think about it. And I think management action is driving the pricing efforts that we see in the Americas at the moment. Both Americas and EMEA are tracking globally weighted CPI for their respective regions in APAC.\nI would say to you that I think we're finding pricing a little bit shorter at this point in time, and that's where currently the push is to make sure that we get that over, over the line. Obviously China is in deflation, so that doesn't help. But again we've got pricing efforts continuing in that space as well.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director and Chemicals Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. I mean, that's helpful, I guess. Maybe one more follow up around that is just. So when I think about CPI and that being something to look towards again, I guess, focusing on the Americas, I mean, with your mix, your pricing is up, call it mid single digit year-over-year in Americas. Is it. Maybe it's up, I don't know, 3% to 4% on a merchant level sequentially, I guess. What CPI indicator is going up at that rate on a quarter-over-quarter basis?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, sure, Josh, it's Matt. I think you have to remember when you think about Americas, you have all of South America to your point, which we have leading positions in just about every country there. So whether it's Brazil, Central America like Mexico, other countries in South America, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, you are continuing to see inflation rates that are much higher than what you would see in a US scenario. So that is all aligned and relative to that, and something we do track consistently, as you well know. Just look at recently the devaluations you've seen across a wide basket of Latam currencies, and that is being offset through higher inflation locally in these countries. So it is driving that.\nIt is part of that now at times, yeah, you may see some different quarter to quarter sequential variances just because on the timing the pricing goes through to inflation, that could create a little bit of a noise. But when we look at the CPI tracking, we tend to look at it in an annualized basis because that's a little bit cleaner on timing. But as Sanjiv said, it continues to track quite closely. It's something that we look at country by country, and when you look at the balance of inflation levels you're seeing especially in Latam, they continue to be elevated, especially vis-à-vis a country like us or a region like Europe.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director and Chemicals Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. I think a couple of years ago you talked about a 3 billion investment opportunity to decarbonize Linde, and I think the direction was to produce more blue hydrogen to change over to ATRs or change your SMRs. How much have you invested, and does that $3 billion number still look good? Have things been stretched out in time? Are they according to plan?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nThank you, Jeff. So yes, we had laid out our decarbonization strategy and roadmap, if you will. As part of that, we said there were three levers. The first lever was, and this was out of a $50 billion investment over 10 years. We had said in the past, first lever was decarbonizing our own operations with that $3 billion estimate. At that point in time, we said a bulk of our deployment would be enabling our customers to decarbonize, which is the second pillar. The third pillar was just some new opportunities for hydrogen to act as an energy vector and for export purposes, et cetera. The first pillar, which is, which you are referring to at the moment, is where a lot of our work at the moment is happening.\nAs you know, we have a large fleet of steam methane reformers or SMRs in the US Gulf Coast. They are part of that network that connects that 500 miles of pipeline that we have and serves between 60 to 80 very large customers for the hydrogen requirements. We are currently in various stages of feed studies for those SMRs to understand the best opportunity for us to do decarbonization on the SMRs. Technically speaking, there are different ways to do that. We can do post-combustion capture, we can do syngas capture. The feed studies are ongoing at this point in time. My view is that we will actually progress with those probably over the next few years. They are in line and on track with our 2035 targets that we set for ourselves.\nI expect to see those business cases be developed as we get to a more technical conclusion. As far as the feed study is concerned, whether that's 3 billion or more, I think the feed will tell us that. So I think we'll wait for the feeds to come through, but order of magnitude, I'd say to you that's in about the right ballpark.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, and then quickly, I realize that your volumes in the United States year-over-year were flat, but if you had to, I'm sorry, in the Americas, but if you had to break it up into packaged, merchant, and on site and compare the volume changes, what would they look like? For Q2?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nJeff, why don't I just talk a little bit about what we're seeing in America. I think this is a good lead into that because I think it'll give you a flavor of where the volumes are. I think hopefully answer your question as well. So I'll start off by just saying that the US market has been incredibly resilient. Right? I mean it surprised most people, but we are now seeing industrial activity being more sluggish. It is reflecting the softer demand growth that is there in the marketplace. And obviously everyone's quoting the PMI, etc. In the last quarter itself we'd reference that we were starting to see that sluggishness in the market. So an exception to that, a notable exception to that is hydrogen demand. Hydrogen volumes are at very high levels and I expect them to remain strong for the rest of the year.\nSo again that is a reflection of what's happening in the chemicals and energy space. Again the on-site piece, which I think you acquiring is one of the key elements of that comes out of those HyCO volumes that we've seen. The other indicator that I watch carefully is the hard goods out of the US packaged business. You heard me say before, I consider hard goods a leading indicator of what is happening in manufacturing and industrial activity. Again, during this quarter we saw hard goods sales decline year-over-year in the low single digits. Clear indicator that you're seeing softer manufacturing environment. I expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters at least. Now hard goods were sequentially flat though.\nSo I think it wasn't that you were seeing sequential worsening, but you were seeing softer year on year movements as far as hard goods were concerned. Again, that gives you an indication what's happening around our package business. I'd say that between those two, I mean, that's a fair view of where we are seeing that volumes played out in terms of what we see between onsite merchant and package.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nEric Zhang\n\nSenior VP and Application Development Tech Senior Lead Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. This is Eric Zhang on for Patrick. Deflationary conditions in China continue to be an issue. Can you talk about the cost actions you are taking in the region and how has pricing trended?\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO, Linde\n\nSure. So I'll begin by just kind of reminding you that in China we serve some of the tier one customers who tend to have the best cost position in their fields and have been quite stable through this downturn. I think it's just as a starting point, having a high-quality customer in China actually is very, very important for the stability and performance of that business.\nIf I talk specifically about cost actions, I'll say to you, you could probably go back, I'd say about 18 months now. When we first talked about concerns around growth in China and the fact that we were treating China business as a mature business and ramping up activities both on cost management around the fixed cost base and enhancing productivity actions as well, and that's been ongoing for about 18 months. It isn't new; we're not acting on it now. We have been undertaking this and using this as an opportunity to reset the cost base in China. Much of that action has already been completed. I feel pretty good about where we stand with the cost base.\nThere is obviously more we can do, and the productivity programs we're running in China, leveraging AI and so on and so forth, are good examples of how we are managing that. I'll give you one very simple example. So most companies in China, most operations in China, for instance, following recent regulatory requirements, have had to recruit between one to five safety officers to go and walk around the plant and take readings and record them so that the authorities can come and audit them.\nNow, most other companies have done that. As you would expect, Linde thought long and hard about how best to accomplish that. At the moment we're rolling out a program called Smart Plants where we're using a combination of drones and robots to do much of these reading of gauges and pressure points within the plant to make sure that they are then automatically recorded. Now that's a productivity project where we've used technology, create a digital solution, and applied that broadly across our fleet of plants in China. Clear productivity benefits. You obviously don't increase your FTEs or your employee costs as a result of doing that. That's just one example of many that I'd give you in terms of the actions that are being taken, which are both smart but also addressing the cost base itself quite, quite significantly. On pricing, China is in deflation.\nSo pricing, if we say we want to kind of keep ourselves at that 2% mark that we'd like to see happen, that's where the team is currently pushing to try and get pricing to continue to move up. There are two elements to the pricing on the industrials, merchant, and package. In particular, we are seeing positive pricing movement there. It is, however, being offset by lower pricing on helium and rare gases, partly driven by lower demand from the electronics segment and partly because we are obviously seeing pressure of helium coming in from Russia into China, which has made China long on helium and has had an impact on pricing there. But beyond that, industrial pricing action continues to be strong and I feel good about the momentum that the team has got over there and we'll continue to see that move forward.\n\nEric Zhang\n\nSenior VP and Application Development Tech Senior Lead Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners",
    "content2": "Yes, thank you and good morning. A few questions on capital deployment for Matt. Your pace of repurchases accelerated a bit in the quarter, and in the prepared remarks, I think you talked about potential harvest of some project prepays in the back half of the year. Could you comment on the likely glide path of repurchases that you would foresee in coming quarters, and maybe contrast that with potential for bolt-on deal activity within the guardrails of your single A rating?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nSure, Kevin. I think obviously I stated our capital allocation policy, which you know well, in the prepared remarks, and that's been consistent going back many, many years and we expect it to remain consistent. And within that repurchases are absolutely an integral part of that and it's something that we expect to be every day in the market. To your point, we have a significant amount of room on the single A rating. That's obvious given our metrics, where they stand right now. And I do expect, as I mentioned, to see a fairly nice pickup in operating cash flow in the back half of this year, just given some of the timing of things that are going to be better in the back half than they were in the first half.\nBut that all being said, you know, our repurchase plan will look out generally for four quarters forward. We will determine a number that we want to deploy in cash based on the capital allocation policy, and then we'll execute inside the quarter. And sometimes we'll accelerate when we see opportunities in the stock. And we definitely saw that this last quarter. So we did accelerate, and we repurchased $1.4 billion recently, and we got good execution and we felt good pricing.\nSo the overall plan will continue to be part of the equation and our cash and our capital allocation. But day to day we will accelerate or change our patterns based on what we see in the market. And as you know, we did that back during COVID times. We did that back during the great financial crisis where we saw some significant opportunities to come in. If we see anything like that again, we absolutely will take advantage of it going forward.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nMatt, any thought on bolt-on deal potential?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nFor M&A? I mean, that's something we're always going to be evaluating for tuck-ins. You could see here in our recent cash flow statement that we had out here that we did do continued more M&A activity. It'll mostly be probably North America, maybe some in our APAC packaged gas business. These are great tuck-ins. They are justified on synergies. So they have a very low risk threshold, and I think that's something between that and DCAPs we are seeing more DCAP opportunities, but our investment criteria for them remains the same. So we'll see if opportunities present themselves with our tier one customers. But that's a consistent aspect of our capital allocation policy to invest back in the business with our investment criteria, and M&A is absolutely part of that.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now take our final question from John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks. Matt, I think you've talked before about return on invested capital plateauing here. Does it stay high or maybe even drift a little higher as long as earnings are driven by productivity in the consumer-based markets, and then when the cyclical markets start to recover and the energy transition investments come in, it starts to come down? Or do you think it plateaus high here even when cyclicals do start to come back and the energy transition investments come in?\n\nMatt White\n\nCFO, Linde\n\nYeah, sure, John. I think to your point, look, when you look at both our margins and our return on capital, we have industry-leading. In the case of return on capital, probably 2x or more to the next, to the next competitor. So the way we view that is we want to continue to grow and grow quality, which means maintain or potentially improve some of the margins and ROC while growing and growing in high quality. Obviously, margins, as I mentioned, we have more room. We have room in each segment. We view them eventually converging, and so that opportunity will continue to take advantage of on the ROC. You're absolutely right. It's just a metric of a numerator with no fat and a denominator of the capital base. For my earlier comments, you know, with Kevin, I mean, our capital allocation policy is very consistent.\nThat won't change. So I feel quite good about the denominator, which is the long range of that equation, on the numerator. It's just going to be a function of our growth rate. Obviously, the higher we grow, you're going to see accelerations in that number. And if your growth is a little lower, then it may be a little more stagnant. So we feel good to maintain these levels. Time will tell if we increase them. You know, we did increase it here another 10 or 20 basis points just given our growth rate. So we'll see. But I am happy at these levels. But to be clear, by no means does ROC drive our investment criteria, right? We look at cash IRR unlevered after tax. That's how we make decisions on incremental investments, whether it's M&A, whether it's projects.\nThat is more driven as a function of getting a premium to our WACC and risk adjusting accordingly. This will not affect our growth in any capacity. But it is a backward-looking accounting metric, and it's important for us because we view return on capital as a key investor metric for our owners, and it's something that we're going to continue to lead the industry on.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for any additional closing remarks.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Linde\n\nAdam, thanks. Nice job. Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out. Stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. You may now disconnect. Thank you."

Welcome to the Linde's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Linde Plc\n\nAbby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for attending our 2024 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of the presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's first quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up the Q&A.\nLet me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nThanks, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone. The Linde team delivered another solid quarter despite stagnant economic conditions across most regions. EPS of $3.75 grew 10%. ROC increased to 25.6% and operating margins reached 28.9%. These all represent record levels even though volumes declined 1%.\nOver the last few quarters, we have seen a row of negative base volumes, which are tracking the stagnant to declining manufacturing environment, especially in EMEA. While volumes continue to track local industrial production, we know there is more we must do to grow. So while pricing remains an important lever for us, we're also focused on other growth opportunities like small on-site, applications technology and investments, including acquisitions, to grow our network density, even as we trim certain areas of the portfolio, like equipment hard goods, which typically suffer in economic downturns. Add to that, the contracted backlog, and we have a solid growth pipeline for the next few years ahead.\nLet me provide you with some additional color on the trends and opportunities by key end markets, which you can find on Slide 3. I'll start with the consumer-related markets, which have proven their resiliency time after time. Health care has been quite stable year-on-year. While we continue to see sleep, respiratory and oxygen demand growing, sales have been partially offset by some rationalization of home care equipment offerings in the Americas and EMEA, which don't meet the investment criteria.\nFood and beverage grew nicely at 6%. This is mostly driven by food freezing, beverage carbonation and aquaculture. We continue to see opportunities associated with the high quality and more sustainable foods. Even though we don't talk much about our food and beverage business, I'm excited to see good growth opportunities ahead. Electronics is up 1%, with two key trends, which mostly offset each other. On the one hand, we continue to see good growth from project startups, which have delivered fairly steady results mostly in APAC. On the other hand, this growth was offset in part by lower packaged and merchant volumes to fabs as production levels were softer. The current trend suggests that this has largely bottomed out with expectations of recovery growing. From where I stand, I have some optimism that we'll see volumes pick up again in the second half of the year. Some of this will be driven by the growing demand for AI chips and new data centers. This is not baked into our guidance at this time.\nTurning to industrial end markets. Metals and Mining are flat as pricing increases are offset by volume declines. EMEA steel mills account for the majority of volume reduction due to weaker industrial activity but protected by strong contracts. At the same time, we are seeing project backlog opportunities pick up for new low-carbon electric arc furnaces or EAFs as well as existing steel customers exploring ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Linde has recently signed a long-term agreement with H2 Green Steel to supply industrial gases for the world's first large-scale green steel production plant in Northern Sweden.\nIn addition, Tier 1 producers like [ Bao ] in China have expanded their relationship with Linde, by decaptivating their ASUs into our existing supply network for the increasing supply reliability and efficiency. We continue to work closely with our steel customers on a range of projects from supporting expansions to decarbonization. Chemicals and Energy were up 4%, driven mostly by higher on-site volumes in the Americas and APAC. U.S. Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical customers ran better this quarter when compared to the planned outages last year, helped today by healthy spreads and access to low-cost natural gas. Furthermore, we continue to see growing interest around decarbonization projects.\nThe manufacturing end market was up 1%. Most of that is pricing. Manufacturing volumes are down year-on-year. The volume decline is split between EMEA and the U.S. EMEA has experienced broad-based declines in industrial production due to geopolitical and energy challenges. In the U.S., manufacturing sales are about flat when excluding the timing of gases supplied to the aerospace sector. Elsewhere, underlying manufacturing volumes have been stable to slightly up across a variety of key sectors, including battery manufacturing, pulp and paper, and merchant scale clean energy opportunities. A good example is our recent announcement to invest in an electrolyzer to grow our merchant hydrogen network density in Brazil and help customers decarbonize.\nLooking ahead, our base volumes are expected to track local industrial production, including in there are some encouraging secular growth trends such as batteries, aerospace and clean energy. Also, resilient end markets such as food and beverage and healthcare will continue to grow mid-single digit, driven by demographics and consumer demand. Furthermore, we have a healthy backlog of approximately $5 billion which will continue contributing to earnings for the next couple of years. However, I'm not expecting near-term improvement in industrial production, especially in certain parts of EMEA. These flat economic conditions are embedded in the guidance assumptions at the midpoint, which Matt will discuss in more detail.\nOverall, I remain confident that we will continue to be nimble and actively manage the balance between volume, price and productivity to grow earnings even in the sluggish economic conditions. And when industrial production levels rebound as they always do, Linde will be very well positioned to leverage this growth.\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through the financial results.\n\nMatthew White\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Slide 4 provides consolidated results for the first quarter. Sales of $8.1 billion declined 1% from prior year and 2% sequentially. When excluding the impact of cost pass-through and engineering project timing, Underlying sales increased 1% over last year but remained flat sequentially.\nPrice continues to drive underlying sales growth with a positive contribution of 2% year-over-year. As discussed in prior calls, pricing is localized for most products and thus is highly correlated to local inflation levels. And while we've seen some disinflation, including deflation in China, levels have stabilized as evidenced by the small sequential price increase. Volumes are down 1% versus prior year and the fourth quarter. While we continue to see positive growth from the project backlog, base volumes are down primarily from negative industrial production, as mentioned by Sanjiv.\nIn addition, we've pruned some noncore offerings in industrial and home care hard goods based on distribution economics, which is consistent with historical approach. Despite lower volumes, operating profit of $2.3 billion increased 6% from 2023, resulting in a margin of 28.9% or 200 basis points higher. You can see margins by segment when excluding the effects of cost pass-through with EMEA continuing to lead due to a combination of price and cost management. EPS of $3.75 increased 10% as a lower share count and favorable tax rate were partially offset by higher net interest. CapEx is 26% over prior year, driven by project backlog timing. Despite this, we are taking actions to tighten overall CapEx levels and thus have lowered the 2024 full year estimate to $4 billion to $4.5 billion.\nSlide 5 includes more detail on capital management, including operating cash flow trends. OCF of $2 billion was slightly above last year, but 28% below the fourth quarter. There are 2 important points to highlight regarding this trend. First, Q1 is always our lowest seasonal quarter due to timing of working capital and incentive payments. Second, 2024 had Good Friday as the last weekday of March, resulting in unfavorable collection timing. This appears on the cash statement as more accounts receivable outflow. But we've seen a recovery in April, which should get us back on track by the end of Q2.\nDespite this timing issue, free cash flow remains healthy as we continue to execute our proven capital allocation policy, including $1 billion of share repurchases in the quarter. We also issued EUR 2.3 billion of long-term debt at attractive rates, enabling us to term out more expensive U.S. dollar commercial paper. These actions continue to reinforce that Linde's strong balance sheet and steady free cash flow are invaluable, especially during times like today.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. For the second quarter, we're initiating an EPS guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80 or 5% to 7% growth when excluding a 1% assumed FX headwind. Consistent with last quarter, this assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint. For the full year, we're updating our prior guidance to a range of $15.30 to $15.60 or 9% to 11% growth excluding a 1% FX headwind. We slightly adjusted the prior range by narrowing both the top and bottom ends by $0.05. Thus maintaining the midpoint, which still assumes no economic improvement.\nWhen looking at the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape, we have not seen any catalyst to warrant a meaningful change in the guidance range at this time. We believe it's appropriate to remain cautious on the remainder of the year until we see tangible evidence of an industrial recovery. Until then, you can rest assured we'll manage the things within our control to continue driving compound shareholder value.\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2023 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast.

By all measures, 2023 was another successful year, thanks to the hard work and dedication from Linde employees around the world. And despite the economic and geopolitical challenges, Linde once again delivered on its commitments with industry-leading results.\nAs I've said before, this doesn't happen by accident. It's a daily grind across the entire organization, underpinned by a disciplined operating rhythm. An important tenet of this rhythm is to maintain a results-driven culture, where we consistently focus on performance metrics that drive shareholder value.\nSlide 3 provides an overview of those areas I view as critical to running a leading industrial gas company. It starts with people. We have a top-notch team who run a safe, reliable and efficient industrial gas company. During 2023, we made meaningful progress towards our goal of highly engaged, diverse workforce and further supported communities we operate in, all while maintaining world-class safety results. I'd like to thank our employees around the world for delivering these results.\nSupporting the environment is more than just lip service at Linde. We've been working on it for decades. Last year, we reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions while increasing our active renewable energy purchases by 1 terawatt hour. It's a good start towards our long-term goals, and I'm pleased to see acknowledgment of this progress in our external recognition.\nWe also positioned the business for high-quality future growth. The OCI project with CapEx of approximately $2 billion will produce 300 million cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen, which will be sold under standard industrial gas supply contracts, while partnering with ExxonMobil for CO2 sequestration. And I continue to be confident about winning new backlog projects in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific, both around $8 billion to $10 billion in the next few years.\nRecently, there have been some updates and indeed some confusion regarding the IRA regulations. We've included a slide in the backup to help explain our views. I'm happy to respond to any questions on it, but let me reiterate the key message. We expect future U.S. on-site clean hydrogen projects to primarily leverage 45Q credits since we have not yet identified any large on-site green hydrogen projects that meet our investment criteria. I expect to see small to midsized green hydrogen projects primarily to serve merchant-type demand, but these will likely not meet our backlog definition.\nAside from clean energy projects, we continue to position the base business well, as evidenced by our traditional on-site merchant, small on-site investments, indeed, where you'll see we have another new record. Finally, we delivered on the numbers. After all, management's primary purpose is to be a steward of shareholder capital. We've listed a few key accomplishments, but I believe the 4 most important financial metrics to create shareholder value can be found on the next slide.\nIt's easy for management to get distracted by a myriad of financial metrics through which performance can be measured. However, one cannot lose sight of the ultimate objective, to increase shareholder value, which can best be represented by total shareholder return, or TSR. From my perspective, the best way to deliver superior TSR is to have industry-leading results in EPS growth, operating cash flow growth, operating profit margins and return on capital.\nROC and operating margin demonstrate the quality and health of the business. And while both have theoretical limits, sustaining them at leading levels while growing EPS and OCF is the best combination for compound value creation. Each chart shows the 5-year trend against 2 members in the industry. Linde has led all of them, in some cases by a wide margin. We maintained leadership despite volatile economic and geopolitical conditions, including unprecedented global events. Linde is an investment for all seasons, and I think these charts demonstrate that.\nSo what about the shareholder? How about metrics that impacted TSR? Well, you can find them on the next slide. This graph shows the 5-year TSR for Linde to members of our industry and the S&P 500 Index. First observation is that Linde has far exceeded all 3 with almost double the shareholder return. But equally important, Linde is one of only 12 companies in the entire S&P 500 to deliver positive alpha for 5 successive years, and the only company in our sector to do so. During good years and bad, Linde consistently outperformed the benchmark to reward our owners.\nThe performance culture and the corresponding compensation programs at Linde are designed to optimize these 4 metrics at all levels of the organization. Year after year, we've proven how they positively correlate to superior TSR and positive alpha, 2 important ways to gauge shareholder value creation. Because of this, I remain confident in our ability to continue creating long-term shareholder value regardless of the economy.\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our financial results.\n\nMatthew White\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Slide 6 provides a summary of fourth quarter results. Sales of $8.3 billion grew 5% over prior year and 2% sequentially. Versus prior year, sales declined 3% from contractual cost pass-through due to lower energy prices in EMEA and Americas, which has no effect on profit.\nForeign currency translation was a 2% tailwind from a weaker U.S. dollar. Acquisitions improved 1% from the nexAir packaged gas purchase, and Engineering increased 1% from project backlog execution. Excluding these items, underlying sales increased 4% from higher prices, which continue to track with globally weighted inflation.\nYear-over-year volumes were flat as contribution from the project backlog was offset by softer base volumes, primarily in EMEA. Versus the third quarter, sales grew 2% from Engineering project timing. Underlying sales were sequentially flat as higher prices offset seasonally lower volumes.\nOverall, economic conditions have been stagnant, as the estimated industrial production growth for our weighted countries was close to 0% for the fourth quarter. Operating profit of $2.3 billion was 14% above last year and resulted in a 27.4% operating margin.\nExcluding cost pass-through, operating margins expanded 130 basis points from last year, but declined 80 basis points sequentially driven by EMEA and Engineering. The EMEA trend mostly relates to seasonality, but Engineering margins are returning to the normal run rate of low to mid-teens percent as we begin to lap the impact from sanctioned projects. However, I still expect global operating margins to expand in the future, including 2024.\nI'd also like to point out a onetime unfavorable impact embedded in this quarter's results related to the Argentinian peso, which devalued over 50%. As a hyperinflationary country, we recorded a charge of $10 million to the Americas operating profit and another $20 million to the interest line, or about $0.05 of total EPS. This impact is not reflected in the sales FX translation summary as it only impacts other operating income and net interest. We fully expect to recover this over time as our pricing aligns with the subsequent local inflation.\nEPS of $3.59 was 14% above last year as pricing net of cost inflation, backlog contribution and a lower share count more than offset lower base volumes. The 1% sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonal factors and the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. Disciplined capital management is a hallmark of Linde's stewardship, and 2023 was no exception. Return on capital finished over 25% against the backdrop of healthy operating cash flow.\nSlide 7 provides further detail on full year capital allocation performance. Operating cash flow of $9.3 billion grew 5% over prior year despite the significant working capital outflows related to wind down of engineering projects. Most of this has passed, which should enable a future OCF-to-EBITDA ratio in the low to mid-80% range.\nOn the right, you can see uses of cash, which is consistent with our long-standing capital allocation policy of an underlying mandate to maintain a single A rating while growing the dividend, a priority to invest in projects which meet our criteria and the opportunity to sweep all remaining capital towards share repurchases.\nWith that approach, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while investing $4.7 billion back into the business. But investing in the business is much more than just a dollar number. One of the most important responsibilities of management is to ensure capital is invested for an appropriate risk-weighted return. Across Linde, we understand this concept and have integrated it into the culture so our owners can sleep well at night.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 8. We're initiating 2024 full year EPS guidance at $15.25 to $15.65, or 8% to 11% growth when excluding an assumed 1% FX headwind. Consistent with prior approach, this assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint. Therefore, if the economy grows, there would be upside. And if there is a recession, we'll take actions to maintain this range.\nFor the first quarter, this translates to a range of $3.58 to $3.68, or 6% to 9% EPS growth, excluding FX. While the economic assumption is similar to the full year, the first quarter is traditionally our lightest due to seasonal factors. Heroes aren't made in February, so we believe it's appropriate to remain cautious this early in the year. However, regardless of what 2024 brings, investors can rest assured that we will manage what matters most to create shareholder value.\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Welcome to Linde's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Abby, and thanks for pronouncing my name correctly.\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast.\nI am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section.

After which, we will wrap up with Q&A.\nLet me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nThanks, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone.\nLinde employees delivered another solid quarter despite the economic headwinds. Earnings per share grew 17%, return on capital closed at 25.6%, operating cash flow was $2.5 billion and operating margins expanded 550 basis points, finishing at 28.3%, and we delivered these results, while continuing to responsibly deploy capital for high-quality growth opportunities and consistent shareholder returns. This is what our owners expect. It's not new and not a surprise.\nTime and again, through recessions and global economic shocks, Linde has consistently delivered industry-leading results through a relentless productivity culture, while increasing network density. And I see no reason why that won't continue going forward. In fact, rather than waste time trying to predict what will happen, we are constantly striving to perfect the model for all seasons.\nHere at Linde, we acknowledge the world is a volatile place. And as stewards of shareholder capital, we are focused on running an organization which can sustainably deliver on owner expectations. Quality earnings growth, leading return on capital and strong cash generation are hallmarks of our history and will be integral to our future performance.\nI think it's important to remind investors of these key tenets at Linde, especially during uncertain times like today. The combination of inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical tension is curtailing risk appetite, and hence, overall economic activity. However, I remain confident in Linde's ability to weather any economic downturn based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and long-term contracts, which is further demonstrated on Slide 3.\nWhen you read the news of government statistics, I know it's hard to be bullish on the global economy. However, when looking at underlying trends by end market, we see a mix picture, with some increasing, while others are flat or slightly down. Overall, underlying sales were up 3% with base volumes down low single-digit percent, which was more than offset by pricing and contribution from project backlog. In other words, the Linde operating model allows us to quickly adapt to maintain steady and compounding value creation, regardless of the macro environment.\nThe resilient consumer-related end markets, which represent about 1/3 of sales, saw solid growth in Food and Healthcare, but a mid-single-digit percent decrease in Electronics. Now, on-site electronic volumes remained stable, with reductions in merchant and packaged gases, primarily from rare gas sales in Asia. Based on customer feedback, I believe we'll begin seeing signs of recovery in the first half of 2024 due to growing AI demand and inventory levels stabilizing.\nIndustrial-related markets make up the remaining 2/3 of sales, and similar to the other sectors, we're seeing mixed trends here. Manufacturing and Chemicals & Energy are both up, primarily led by the United States. We continue to see U.S. packaged gas volumes stable at a high watermark, including met fab as well as the recovery in Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline volumes which have carried into the fourth quarter as well.\nConversely, Metal's end market volumes are down slightly from weaker economic conditions. Overall, higher prices and growth from contractual project backlog more than offset weaker base volumes. This is because our long-term customer contracts stabilize results through inflation adjustment and fixed payment clauses. Said differently, we have the right business model and operating rhythm to weather any storm.\nLooking ahead into the fourth quarter, the U.S. economy continues to navigate at high levels, with pretty much every end market expected to grow year-on-year and remained stable sequentially. China volumes are expected to remain flattish even at Manufacturing, Chemicals & Energy end markets may show a mild recovery, while Steel and Electronic volumes continue to remain flat.\nRegarding Europe, we have not yet seen an inflection point, so the expectation is that volumes will hold around the third quarter levels, ex some normal seasonal impact. Despite the softer macro environment and higher interest rates, proposal activity continues to be robust, and our backlog has increased by $300 million to $8.1 billion, of which $4.5 billion are sale of gas projects. In addition, our clean energy projects continue to progress well as our customers remain committed to decarbonizing their assets.\nFinally, our priorities remain intact. Be best-in-class in safety, compliance, sustainability and talent development, while maintaining a high-performance culture which remains focused on delivering on our commitments. So although the global economy seems tepid, I can only tell you that Linde will continue to deliver on its commitments.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial results.\n\nMatthew White\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Slide 4 provides a summary of third quarter results. Sales of $8.2 billion decreased 7% from last year and 1% sequentially. Although these numbers are not indicative of underlying trends. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances to customers, decreased 6% from last year, but had no effect on profit. In addition, the Engineering business decreased 4% from prior year and 1% sequentially due to timing of project billings. When excluding these items, along with impacts from FX and net divestitures, underlying sales increased 3% over last year and 1% over the second quarter.\nPrice increased 5% over prior year and 1% sequentially, as the business units continue to contractually recover higher levels of inflation. In fact, globally-weighted CPI for our countries of operation also increased 5% in the third quarter, further validating this correlation. Volumes were flat sequentially and decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by the Electronics and Metals & Mining end markets.\nOverall, year-to-date volume trends have tracked closely with globally-weighted industrial production. We regularly monitor tank and cylinder returns to validate this correlation and have not identified any material differences. In other words, the volume decline is driven by existing contractual customers requiring less gas refills since their production decreased proportionately with industrial activity in their local economy. I fully expect volumes to recover in line with each local economy.\nOperating profit of $2.3 billion increased 15% over prior year and 1% sequentially. Operating margin expanded 550 basis points to 28.3% as price actions, cost productivity, and fixed payment contracts enabled greater leverage from the 3% underlying sales growth. Excluding cost pass-through, operating margins expanded 400 basis points across all business segments, led by EMEA at 600 basis points.\nNote that America has experienced elevated power cost in the third quarter, which had a negative impact to merchant and packaged margins. However, this will be recovered over the next 1 to 2 quarters. EPS of $3.63 increased 17% and as we continue to deliver on the stated goal of double-digit percent EPS growth. CapEx of $950 million increased 24% from last year, primarily due to project CapEx spending in support of the $4.5 billion sale of gas backlog.\nAs a reminder, the Linde definition of project backlog is unique and the most stringent in the industry. Inclusion requires assured growth, a customer contract with fixed fees and explicit termination provisions to ensure investment returns. Furthermore, the $600 million of base CapEx includes $320 million of additional growth investments to increase network density.\nDuring uncertain times like today, shareholders want to sleep well at night knowing their investment is safe in management's hands, which is further supported on Slide 5. Proper capital management and quality cash generation have always been at the core of our operating rhythm. We've been following the same capital allocation policy for decades. It starts with generating true operating cash flow because contrary to what some might think, working capital does matter.\nYou can see the stable trends, with the most recent quarter coming in at $2.5 billion. Recall that we had some cash tax timing impact in the first half of the year which we've now lapped. Therefore, I expect the operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio to remain in the low to mid-80% range.\nWhile our mandate is to maintain an A credit rating and grow the dividend, the priority for our capital is to invest into the business. This follows our time-tested investment criteria, which has enabled Linde to consistently achieve industry-leading ROC year after year. After investing into the business, surplus cash is used for share repurchases. Having a strong balance sheet, stable cash generation and an active stock repurchase program enables value-creating opportunities during turbulent markets.\nIn fact, our best stock repurchases happen when equity markets overreact. This is why we recently announced a new $15 billion stock repurchase program, allowing us to optimize our excess free cash flow and robust balance sheet. We'll continue to take advantage of stock market dislocations and return capital to our owners in a tax-efficient manner.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. For the full year, we're raising guidance to a range of $14 to $14.10, representing a 14% to 15% growth rate. Consistent with prior quarters, the upper end assumes no sequential economic improvement. The updated full year guidance implies a fourth quarter range of $3.38 to $3.48. Excluding FX, the midpoint is down 4% sequentially due to engineering project timing and base volumes, including seasonality, although we are taking actions to improve this range.\nAs Sanjiv mentioned, global volatility appears to be the norm these days, so we must run our business in a manner which navigates the uncertainty, while executing the strategy and delivering on commitments. And while no one can predict what will happen tomorrow, let alone next year, Linde owners can rest assured knowing their capital will be properly managed for sustained compound growth in any environment.\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Please read the forward looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides.\n\nAnd note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.\n\nThe reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation.\n\nwill provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on second quarter financial performance and outlook.\n\nAfter which we will wrap up with Q&A.\n\nLet me now turn the call over to Sochi.\n\nThank you everyone.\n\nAnd a very good morning, everyone.\n\nLinda team once again delivered strong results despite the challenging environment.\n\nThe second quarter, we grew EPS ex FX by 16%.\n\nExpanded margins 440 basis points and increased return on capital to 24, 9%.\n\nThese results don't just happen on their all.\n\nThey require a strong execution culture, and operating rhythm, which ensures that all 66000 employees are aligned towards creating shareholder value.\n\nRoute of how we've demonstrated this resilience quarter after quarter, regardless of the economy.\n\nTo this end we are seeing some economies stagnate will start to soften as evidenced by recent data.\n\nI'm not going to try and predict what the future is going to do because nobody really knows.\n\nBut I can tell you with some confidence that Lindsay will continue to manage what we can control and deliver on our commitments, which is reflected in our guidance for the year.\n\nFor example.\n\nWe are managing inflation by contractually passing through energy cost variances, while securing price increases which are aligned with local market trends.\n\nThis was a key part of our contractual structure and operating discipline that we've consistently demonstrated for decades.\n\nAfter that our backlog that fuels growth.\n\nWe are currently executing our seven 8 billion dollar project backlog on time and on budget.\n\nFor me a healthy backlog contains quality customers with secured returns and is constantly turning over.\n\nIn the last 12 months alone we.\n\nWe started up 22 projects valued at $2 $1 billion.\n\nWinning 38, new projects valued close to $3 billion.\n\nLooking ahead investors can rest assured we'll win projects that add value commensurate with the risk.\n\nWith this in mind, we continue to make good progress on the $50 billion of clean energy opportunities of which I expect 9% to $10 billion to be decided in the next few years.\n\nWe continue to see ample quality growth opportunities within our traditional industrial gases business.\n\nThis year, we made the largest acquisition in Linzess history with Nexsan.\n\nSignificantly enhancing our packaged gas presence in the fast growing southeastern United States.\n\nHappy to say, it's performing well ahead of expectations and further validates our tuck in acquisition strategy.\n\nIn addition, we have consistently returned capital through stock repurchases and increasing dividends.\n\nBoth to reward orders and also ensure investment discipline.\n\nLet me now wrap up with a quick overview of end markets, which you can find on slide three.\n\nStarting with consumer related markets.\n\nWe are positive year on year organic growth, primarily driven by price increases.\n\nSequential trends are subject to seasonality.\n\nSo youll see less respiratory health care, but more beverage combination during warmer months.\n\nHealth care itself is growing mid single digit as expected and food and beverage continues to expand as we see more applications for food freezing and aquaculture.\n\nWhile electronics is up versus prior year, we see some sequential softness from law packaged and merchant sales into fabs, although the onsite volumes appear to be stable.\n\nBut the industrial markets, both manufacturing and metals and mining are growing 9% led by price improvements as well as strength in battery production commercial space and carbon steel.\n\nYou can see that chemicals and energy is growing the least at only 1%.\n\nAnd this is primarily driven by customer turnarounds in the United States as well as lower demand in Europe .\n\nI expect the U S to improve for the second half since a number of customers already back up.\n\nBut it's difficult to project, how European demand will develop.\n\nYou will recall that these contracts are underpinned by fixed payments. So our profit impact is mitigated.\n\nOverall, the business continues to perform well as we adapt to local market conditions in.\n\nIn fact, since our module, we've grown EPS, an average of 19% per year.\n\nFrom 2019 due today.\n\nThis was achieved against the backdrop of a global pandemic supply chain constraints energy crisis military conflict and the largest inflation increase in decades.\n\nI continue to have confidence Linda will grow EPS double digit percent on average regardless of the economic environment.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.\n\nSlide four provides an overview of second quarter results.\n\nSales of $8 $2 billion are down 3% to last year, but flat sequentially.\n\nThe comparison has some noise related to movements in FX translation.\n\nExcluding these items underlying price and volume are up 6% versus prior year and 3% versus first quarter.\n\nHigher prices are the main driver of underlying sales growth.\n\nWith an increase of 7% versus 2022 and 1% sequentially.\n\nConsistent with prior years pricing trends are representative of the weighted inflation rates across our countries of operation.\n\nAnd while we're seeing some disinflation and more developed regions, we're not seeing deflation.\n\nIf the disinflation persists I'd expect moderating price increases going forward, especially as we lap prior year comps.\n\nFrom a volume perspective sequential trends played out as expected with a 2% seasonal improvement.\n\nBut year over year is down 1% despite positive contribution from the project backlog.\n\nThere are two contributing factors to the base volume decline.\n\nAbout a quarter relates to lower onsite volumes in the U S Gulf Coast, where customers took more outages than last year.\n\nMost customers are back up and running so we anticipate sequential volume growth into Q3.\n\nThe remaining decline primarily relates to EMEA, which had a 4% volume decrease led by on site customers.\n\nDespite the lower year over year volumes operating profit of $2 3 billion increased 15% and resulted in an operating margin of 27, 9%.\n\nPresenting an increase of 440 basis points or 350 basis points, when excluding cost pass through.\n\nThis profit growth was achieved from a combination of higher pricing.\n\nFixed payment contracts to mitigate volume decline and a stable cost structure.\n\nEvery region achieved triple digit basis point margin increases when excluding cost pass through effects.\n\nYeah.\n\nEPS of $3 57 rose, 15% from prior year or 16% when excluding the effects of currency.\n\nAs Sanjiv mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to deliver an average EPS growth rate of double digit percent.\n\nProject Capex is increasing from a larger sale of gas backlog trend I expect to continue.\n\nHowever, despite the higher Capex return on capital reached another new high at 24, 9% as our no Pat continues to grow at a rate faster than the capital base.\n\nSlide five provides more color on capital management, including cash trends.\n\nSecond quarter operating cash flow of $2 2 billion.\n\nIt was only up 1% from last year, despite the higher earnings.\n\nThis is due to unfavorable cash tax timing, which increased almost $300 million in the quarter.\n\nThese outflows will stabilize for the second half and so I expect the ocs to EBIT DAU ratio for the balance of the year to be closer to the expected low 80% range.\n\nAvailable operating cash flow, which we define as ocs less base Capex remained steady at $1 $6 billion per quarter, and thus provides ample liquidity to pursue our capital allocation policy.\n\nWhich you can see in the Pie chart.\n\nThrough six months, we generated $5 $4 billion of capital and returned a little more than half to shareholders, while investing the balance back into the business.\n\nWe believe this is a healthy ratio to achieve quality growth while rewarding owners.\n\nAnd to be clear, we are not capital constrained in anyway, and thus, we'll pursue all growth investments, which meet our criteria.\n\nI'll wrap up with guidance on slide six.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe're raising full year guidance to a new range of $13 80.\n\n$2014 or 12% to 14% growth over 2022.\n\nThis represents an increase of 35 on the bottom end.\n\nAnd 15 on the top end.\n\nThe top end increase is primarily attributed to the better Q2 results.\n\nWhile the second half assumption is consistent with last quarter.\n\nTherefore, the $14 figure assumes no economic improvement for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe bottom end increased more as we tightened the range from greater confidence on the year.\n\nBy default the bottom end assumes economic contractions and more negative volumes going forward.\n\nConsistent with prior guidance. This does not represent our economic view, but rather is the baseline for the assumption.\n\nIrrespective of what happens, we'll manage the business accordingly.\n\nFor the third quarter, we are providing an EPS guidance range of $3 48.\n\nTo $3 58.\n\nUp 12% to 15% versus prior year.\n\nConsistent with the full year assumption at the top end assumes a flat economy and below that implies more recessionary conditions.\n\nNote that FX is a 2% tailwind for the third quarter, but has no impact to the full year.\n\nTo sum it up regardless of the economic rhetoric or latest opinion on what part of the cycle. We're in.\n\nLindy employees will continue to do what they do best.\n\nEfficiently run the worlds, leading industrial gas and engineering company.\n\nWhile creating long term compounding shareholder value.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you.\n\nI would like to ask a question. During this time simply press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad.\n\nIf you would like to withdraw your question Press Star one a second time and we will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\n\nAnd we will take our first question from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nYes, good morning, guys.\n\nQuestion off of Matt's comment that.\n\nWe may be getting towards the end of what's been a really nice pricing cycle, yes.\n\nThat pricing increase drops back to kind of historic maybe 20 year trend line numbers, how do you continue to grow double digits and that kind of an environment.\n\nSure Duffy.\n\nMatt I think first to start with and as I mentioned and as you well know our pricing, we always view as a function of inflation and this will be the globally weighted average inflation.\n\nSo I think starting with that I won't tell you what our pricing will be its more a function of where you think inflation will be and when we look at the at least 10, if not 15 year trend arguably inflation right now is clearly higher than what it's been before.\n\nEspecially when you think post 2008.\n\nWe definitely saw significant disinflation and even deflation back in those years. So from that perspective, while we continue to expect to price to inflation and we are seeing disinflation in developed markets I still would expect our overall pricing to remain in line with overall inflation, which I expect will continue to be high.\n\nHere than what we've seen at least in the last 10 years.\n\nAside from that we as you know have a lot of other factors, including our backlog startup we have.\n\nWe will see what happens with volume, but right now if we do see inflation abate in theory, you could probably see some volumes start to come back and.\n\nAnd we will continue to have a lot of strong free cash flow that will deploy and everything from stock repurchases to things like acquisitions.\n\nFor a roll up strategy like Sanjiv had mentioned so overall as the economy moves with pricing and inflation. You may have also industrial production trends that could go the other way and that's what we've seen over the last several decades, and we will see what happens going forward.\n\nFair enough and then.\n\nMaybe on a couple of different numbers were about a year and to the inflation reduction act being passed and signed you've kind of two times, you've come out with that $33 billion number last fall now.\n\nNow kind of a more global $50 billion number and kind of over a decade period, if those numbers come to fruition, how would you scope when we get to kind of maximum backlog and what that May look like and then what would kind of the capex shape look like over that decade long period as those.\n\nThese projects roll through to the backlog.\n\nSure. So there are two parts to the backlog I'll quickly cover the clean energy piece, which you are referring to on the IRA and other incentives we see around the World Duffy and then we'll briefly just talk about the traditional end market, which tends to get forgotten a little bit, but we're also seeing interesting project pipeline of growth as well, but let's start with the clean energy piece and really.\n\nThe way I look at that backlog today is just looking at what is feeding into that potential backlog for the future and what are we currently developing that's likely to result in that backlog.\n\nThe answer to your question I think in brief is over the next five to seven years will continue to see this backlog growth, we'd like to see it grow at a at a relative base increasing year on year and I think thats on the basis of the amount of activity we see.\n\nWe are still pursuing about 200 projects that I've referenced before we went out and told you in the U S. We think the IRI is driving a potential project pipeline for us where we make decisions on about $30 billion over the next 10 years and I certainly see that backlog reflect as those decisions get made as we move forward I'm also happy to say.\n\nWe are actually seeing most of those projects progressing extremely well in the U S and Canada and even outside of the middle East and Europe as well.\n\nProject development cycles tend to take a little bit longer I explained that in the last earnings call.\n\nThe lead time anywhere between 12 to 24 months between our pre feasibility at feasibility to feed then to get down to the final investment decision. So the timing tends to be a little bit lumpy, but youll see that happen as we as we move forward I'll also reiterate that I expect over the next few years decisions around 9% to 10 billion, which are more tangible.\n\nIn terms of projects that are currently getting developed all of that translates once those decisions happen into the backlog.\n\nDuffy I'll, just go out and add a little bit of flavor on the traditional markets as well our traditional end markets are seeing.\n\nFair amount of strong proposal activity.\n\nAnd this includes all the decarbonization that we just referred to the opportunity pipeline is spread across many end markets here, starting with electronics metals energy chemicals and includes a few decaf division opportunities for us as well as.\n\nAs you know our current sale of gas backlog is about $4 4 billion.\n\nThat's after we adjusted for the $1 4 billion for the Singapore projects. So we took that out as we are starting ramp up on that already.\n\nAbout 50% of that backlog today is around our traditional end markets and we see potential for continued growth in there.\n\nExpect the backlog probably towards the end of the year to be closer to about a 5 billion number.\n\nYeah.\n\nGreat. Thank you guys.\n\nAnd we'll take our next question from Mike with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thank you good morning, guys.\n\nI just wanted to ask on EMEA.\n\nhas continued to grow earnings fairly well, while European economic and chemical indicators remain quite weak. So can you just talk about what's enabled you to outpace the broader market.\n\nHow you your comfort around the sustainability of the sort of earnings level of growth.\n\nIn the context of if we assume the European economy remains sort of as is today.\n\nSure Mike.\n\nSo let's go back a little bit in time couple of years ago. The EMEA business went through a reasonably large restructure essentially intended to reset that Gulf space at that stage. We obviously couldnt look at the end of the war in Russia, or the energy crisis or any of that but we just felt that it was about time that we got a reset on that cost base and thats really well.\n\nIt's holding us in a good step today, obviously, a lot of productivity actions productivity deeply embraced across that entire business today is paying out dividends and obviously they are managed very disciplined pricing over this period as well, which was absolutely essential given what happened to energy costs et cetera.\n\nEMEA performance and the team has done a fantastic job.\n\nEMEA performance, holding and continuing to move forward I see them managing their business in order to make sure that margins continue to hold our hopefully go up slightly as you would expect from our business.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat. Thank you and then just briefly a housekeeping question on electronics I believe TSMC delayed the start of their Arizona fab by about a year or so with that also delay your sales for that site by an equivalent amount.\n\nMike My expectation is we will start that TSMC first plant second half of this year.\n\nEven before the fab actually stopped a lot of product is needed to make sure that tools are in place and test. It out. So that process has started all fabs go through a ramp process I suspect tsmc's announcements will probably related to other negotiations that we're having rather than the actual startup of the fab and how it progresses in terms of its ramp.\n\nGreat. Thank you guys.\n\nWe will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with J P. Morgan Your line is open.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nHi.\n\nThe multinational oil companies have been outsourcing hydrogen production to industrial gas companies because they believe that their returns on capital are higher and drilling for oil and gas.\n\nBut now that the inflation reduction act has been passed to returns on capital for them for producing their own hydrogen rise because they get a tax credit and we're beginning to see over a longer period of time the.\n\nThe multinational oil companies wanting to produce hydrogen.\n\nSo in your opinion when you look out over the next 10 years do you expect to see lower hydrogen demand from your traditional hydrogen customers that will probably backend.\n\nWhat do you think the dynamic is different.\n\nSo Jeff I would say to you that the dynamic from our perspective looks a little bit different than I'm going to kind of drill down a little bit into into the hypothesis you've laid out so let's look at it from a perspective of Lindsay perspective, and I would say to you we see the following as it plays out related to hydrogen now.\n\nWe went back in time as I look at the positive outsourced and Thats, absolutely right and the reason they had outsourced all from the economics was the fact that Lindsay handles those hydrogen plants extremely well, it's the core of R. R.\n\nIt's our bread and butter part of our business, we know well, we manage those processes well, whereas in the large refinery or a chemical complex those assets by themselves and really do not get optimized. So there is a value that gets unlocked by bringing a very competent operator like lending to the mix, but thats, how observation happened in the .\n\nAnd I suspect will happen in the future as well.\n\nLet's talk about the actual hypothesis that you've put forward not say tier three things happened from a linear perspective.\n\nOne the fuel market, which thus far was managed and if hydrogen as a part of the.\n\nPalio Lindsay now has access to a much larger piece of cake. The buyer has grown if you will and our ability to tap into that because our hydrogen now plays a role in that.\n\nIt creates a huge advantage.\n\nThe expectation is hydrogen market will grow to maybe about 150 billion over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nAgain, the fuel market itself. If you if you look at the entire number is anywhere between six to seven trillion. So even a small slice of that buy makes it very interesting from a linear perspective, so we have a new market opening.\n\nNow available to us in some ways. The other piece I'd say to you is that the leverage hydrogen production for merchant required.\n\nDescribe that from an IOC NOC perspective, if thats, what youre, referring to I would say what is necessary as the installed base of assets. It's the network of pipelines and it's the contracted customers hooked onto those pipelines, which obviously create that advantage. The reason I mentioned all of that is because Linda has the ability to.\n\nthat up and provide hydrogen to refiners. In addition to ensuring that surplus hydrogen that's taken and put into the pipeline network, providing a significant advantage and obviously getting us economic returns that would not be available on a standalone asset basis the.\n\nThe third point really is around risk debt.\n\nAnd I'll say it again, the benefit that Lindsay hasn't U S Gulf Coast, which you, which you saw Jeff.\n\nA weeks ago, the net wells that we have over there provides a high degree of redundancy using the cavalry using the multiple assets hooked onto the network, reducing the operational risk with single loss either sites or plant and again that advantage that Linda carriers will be.\n\nEnormously valuable for them.\n\nAll customers in the U S Gulf Coast, and I think they will they value that today and as we continue to expand that network stable value that even more as we move forward all of those provide the competitive advantage. We are looking at however.\n\nHowever, I'll accept the point that I think as far as Iras there for a period of about 10 to 12 years, there will be some financial benefits that will accrue from either owning those assets, but in many of those cases people might own the assets in Austin Lindsay to either incorporate that into our network and operate and manage it as well again, providing greater opportunity for us.\n\nYou put that together I think that's essentially what the hydrogen kind of of the future is going to look like from a U S. Gulf Coast perspective replicated in many other parts of the world.\n\nOkay. Thank you for that.\n\nYour author line.\n\nThis helpful comments in your slides.\n\nYou said corporate costs are being offset by the helium business.\n\nThe other line used to lose $300 million back in two.\n\n2018, 2007, 2018, 2019, so that we've come to breakeven.\n\nReally mean that that 300 million Delta is mostly positive helium prices overtime that continue going forward.\n\nI'll, let Mike walk you through the math just to say that I'm not happy with where the other line is and it should be bigger than it is today.\n\nYeah.\n\nHey, Jeff.\n\nSo just maybe to start with what is in other alright, thats probably the good place to start. So currently what's in other is our materials technology business, formerly called PST you may recall, the coatings business. It has what we call.\n\nWholesale our Interco helium business. So this is where we source globally. Since it is one of the very very few global products that we make and sell we source. It and then we sell it inter company to all of the regions.\n\nTherefore, it's more of an intercompany type pricing structure.\n\nA structure that we have with that and then obviously the end regions by it and intercompany we eliminate it and they get the end pricing in their regions for healing and then it has all of our global corporate costs to manage Lindy plc as a whole.\n\nAs you well know we divested just that used to be in there that is gone.\n\nSo that's what's in there today and one thing we've always said for many years is .\n\nTo your exact point and I would kind of take 2018 with a grain of salt that was a transition year.\n\nThat was as you know a pro forma number there were some elements that didn't fit particularly into the segments that needed to go in that section as we did pro forma at the time of the merger. So I would use 2019 as the better starting point because that is post the merger when we had I'd say more consistency across what was in there.\n\nAnd when you think about it we've always said our goal is to make sure that these businesses and other which are not core industrial gas businesses.\n\nAnd more than offset the corporate costs of this global organization and we're seeing that and we expect to continue to see that and it's a combination of the noncore businesses improving their performance, which they're absolutely doing and it's also a combination of managing our corporate cost appropriately in light of what's going on in the world and what's going on in the segment.\n\nWe support so that's how to think about that but we're going to continue to look to create value in the other segment like we do anywhere else in any other segment going forward.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nAnd we'll take our next question from Nicola Tang with BNP. Your line is open.\n\nHi, everyone just one for me on margins.\n\nYou can see further margin upside into next year at group level, but I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how that would play out from a regional perspective, so I'm thinking that pricing normalization in Europe .\n\nIs there a situation where the European margins trend down from here, but then actually another region takes over to drive great margins.\n\nI think like we've had questions on margins consistently as Youll recall.\n\nI've always said look your expectation and our expectation is we will expand margins year on year by about 30% to 50 basis points and that's kind of the trend that we want to see happen. Obviously this quarter delivered significantly higher than that across all segments.\n\nAnd that is good and as you know, it's driven by pricing and productivity and the base business continuing to deliver.\n\nGreat outcomes.\n\nCouple of highlights on that I'd say at the regional level America's hitting a 30 30 plus percent margin that's a good point.\n\nWe've got to make sure that EMEA and APAC are looking ahead to beating America. So they kind of have to set the target for the rest of EMEA margins. You are right also a highlight for us in the quarter.\n\nAt 29, 2%.\n\nThey have now grown over over since 2018 baseline they've grown about 1000 basis points and have grown consistently so the point that I made earlier on around the fact that we've reset our cost base in EMEA. The fact that we were pushing productivity and pricing.\n\nIt gives me a lot of confidence that we will try and hold that margin level and continue to try and look for that module improvement that I suggested on a year on year basis.\n\nAs far as APAC is concerned we've also seen good margin.\n\nDevelopment since that baseline of 2018 to where we are today.\n\nAt 228% they were up about it.\n\nthousand 70 basis points.\n\nAnd again thats been fairly consistent over that period. So I fully expect that we will continue to work on our margin to work with that intent of delivering 30 to 50 basis points every year.\n\nAlright, Thank you certainly impressive.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nThank you good morning.\n\nproductivity has been a key driver of earnings growth this year.\n\nMinus what that number quantify that number this year and should it be similar next year as well.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo all I'll tell you that productivity is something that sits right at the heart of.\n\nHow we manage our base business, David as you know well.\n\nAnd essentially I mentioned in one of the earnings calls previously that we had about 14000 projects last year in 2022 four.\n\nFor the first half of this year, we have in excess of 8000 projects. So I feel pretty good about the fact that there is a continuous pipeline of productivity projects that continue to work through and actually deliver there is no silver bullet there isn't a single big thing that we do.\n\nThe aggregation of these 8000 plus projects that actually deliver results for us as we move forward.\n\nThe way, we think about the number on productivity is to look at its impact on the .\n\nThe cost base that it actually kind of leverages off so we measure that as a percentage to that cost stack.\n\nAnd as things stand, we kind of look at a range of between 5% to 7% of cost stack.\n\nAnd Thats, what then flows into the bottom line that we walk through.\n\nVery good and just on the clean energy opportunity is there a market share you're thinking about that lindy should attain over a longer period of time.\n\nTo be honest, we don't think about the clean energy opportunity or the portfolio in terms of market share. We think in terms of selecting high quality projects that meet our investment criteria and that give us that allow us to leverage the asset base and the network that we have giving us competitive advantage and really to be honest. When we went out and gave you.\n\nSome numbers around that $30 billion in terms of decisions, we're likely to make over the decade in the U S of $50 billion across the world is driven really around the opportunity set and that's how I'd like to think about that the market share will be what it will be.\n\nReally thinking about focusing on choosing the right opportunities and ensuring that we develop them well go through a proper feed in process and actually execute well. These are advantages that our engineering team brings for US we do all of that we then have a substantive business as we move forward.\n\nThank you.\n\nWe will take our next question from Tony Jones with Redburn. Your line is open.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd Mr. Jones. Your line is open please check your mute button.\n\nAnd hearing no response, we will move to our next question from Peter Clark with Society Generale. Your line is open.\n\nYes. Thank you hopefully you can hear me.\n\nTwo questions. The first one I've listened to the discussion on the pricing the inflation thing.\n\nLooks like you've still got momentum at least into the third quarter. So I'm just wondering about sequential price into the third quarter. Then we will see from Q4, so I'm, assuming you've got something and then on the EMEA.\n\nMargin discussion I'm, Ryan thinking obviously on site was hit hard as soon as that presumably help the margin a little bit on mix. Just wondering how you see the second half in EMEA on bulk and on.\n\nOn site because one of your competitors is a bit more confidence about the second half year on year comp and the on site given the very strong comp and obviously energy costs in Europe , now a bit more confidence with the customer. So how do you see those things. Thank you.\n\nPeter I'll go back and refer to the comment that provided on pricing earlier on to say that we believe got established long term history of positive pricing coming out of Lindy.\n\nWe think globally weighted inflation is a great proxy for four lenders pricing in.\n\nIn Q2, you saw us deliver 7% globally weighted inflation for us was between five and 6%. So we are slightly ahead of that that momentum that you talk about I think is really built around inflation and we've said that we are a good player on inflation and we will continue to progress with that I'll also just mention that pricing is really all about management.\n\nI mean, rather than relying on a set of indices, we proactively work on pricing to make sure that product pricing continues to grow and has expanded and thats really what where we're pricing impact comes through we don't rely on surcharges for sustainable pricing longer term.\n\nAs far as EMEA margin is concerned.\n\nWithout getting into the detail of how we see the margin split between the impact from different businesses, what I would say to you is you've seen some some very.\n\nI would say in some ways spectacular margins coming out of EMEA.\n\nIt's really been driven around mix of pricing and productivity running deepen that organization and I fully expect that that quality of business that we've now enhanced in EMEA will continue as we move forward and I think the mix.\n\nNot really be that impactful for us really overall, our portfolio will deliver the margins that we're looking for.\n\nI'll also make another point just to kind of remind folks that I think about margin and you've heard me say this before we constantly benchmark as an organization, we might even be obsessed by benchmarking and one of the things that I lay out for the business very often is just reminding them.\n\nThat I am using 2022 numbers, because thats kind of just the baseline we were using.\n\nBut when I take 2022 margin numbers in.\n\nIn the Americas more than 10 countries had margins in excess of 30%.\n\nIn Europe , our EMEA that we just talked about 17 countries that margin more than 30% and in APAC about seven countries at margins more than 30%. The reason I mentioned that to you is because our internal benchmark drives a lot of the behavior within the segments driving ourselves to make sure that we are improving the overall aggregate by targeting.\n\nGetting to margins that get to that 30% kind of target that we've got internally and which Americas are set for the rest of the segments as well.\n\nThank you do you think the on site, we've been answered in the second half yourself an EAA.\n\nIt's very difficult to predict what onsite will do I've said this in my in my opening comments as well, it's very difficult to predict what onsite will do in Europe at the moment, particularly chemicals and energy I do see an uptick on metals. So I do believe that metals will continue to show that momentum, but it is difficult to predict what chemicals and energy.\n\nAnd it is going to be driven by multiple factors, including energy prices, but also what happens in terms of the winter and the weather.\n\nGot it thank you.\n\nAnd we will take our next question from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nHistorically volume.\n\nSort of drove some good portion of adjusted EBIT growth.\n\nYour volumes are down 1%, yet you're still able to generate pretty impressive operating profit growth and EPS growth. So.\n\nIf volumes turned positive whenever they do.\n\nDoes that does your leverage get better from here or do you have to add cost to sort of support that some of that volume growth.\n\nMike the way to think about this is really if you look at how we think about our EPS growth algorithm right and we've said this before there are there are two or three components that drive that.\n\nOur base business drives a large part of that right. We expect our base business to deliver anywhere between 4% to 6% of that EPS growth that we talk about the target that we've set for ourselves of 10 plus percent EPS growth backlog given that backlog continues to grow at the moment probably are in the past you would expect backlog to provide between 1% to two.\n\ngrowth, we now see that with backlog growth going forward, that's going to range, probably between 1% to 3% probably at the top end given the higher capex backlog that Youll see and then we will.\n\nHave a little bit of an uplift from share buybacks, which will remain largely consistent about 2% you added all up that kind of gets you to the algorithm of 10 plus percent the base business delivering about 46% Theres a mix in the base business Youll see pricing youll see productivity and you'll see some volume, but volumes are down pricing and productivity has to do more when volumes pick up.\n\nObviously, we see a little bit of cost come in but it will be modest productivity very very hard through that period as well. So it's a mix of base business, 4% to 6% kind of contribution to the EPS growth that you should be thinking about.\n\nUnderstood and then for the second half are your volumes.\n\nAnd if I missed this are they are they going to stay similar to the second quarter. They can improve a little bit on a year over year basis. I know sequentially. I think you mentioned is going to be better and then how much volume growth you get from new projects in 'twenty four.\n\nSo.\n\nAs said before we are starting up projects.\n\nAll in here.\n\nThey are about $2 billion, a large portion of that was the Singapore piece Thats already happened that is ramping up through the course of this year and the balance will happen in the second half. So youll see some backlog contribution through the course of the second half broadly on volumes I would say to you.\n\nI expect why don't I, just do a quick walk around the world and give you a sense of what I'm seeing across in terms of expectations. So if you look at Americas, we were kind of largely flat for the quarter and Q2 adjusted for customer outages in the U S Gulf Coast and some software electronics.\n\nSales, mainly on rare gases the U S. Gulf coast customers have largely come back and they are ramping up production. So I expect positive volume sequentially. As a result of that module sales I would say to you probably expect that to be flattish remember it's important I think sometimes we forget but the Americas business. Overall has showed steady recovery since COVID-19 we are at.\n\nLevels, well above pre COVID-19. So we are at somewhat of a high watermark and I'm seeing that flatten out a little bit.\n\nAnd we feel pretty good about where that is as far as the U S. Packaged business is concerned.\n\nWe are in Q2, we saw mid single digit growth.\n\nManufacturing saw some some upside and then that is offset by electronic sales being a little bit softer on the rig as the site Todd.\n\nHard goods in Q2 were a bit of a mixed bag, we saw consumables wire et cetera grow we saw.\n\nEquipment sales come down little bit expectations assay for the U S package business would be flattish as we as we go into Q3 so.\n\nAll in I would say some upside from the HEICO business U S Gulf coast, but beyond that probably flat volumes as far as APAC is concerned.\n\nI think it's a story of China and the rest of Asia, the rest of Asia, India, particularly IC growth continuing I see that momentum in the second half as well.\n\nObviously on a little bit softer, but will still grow but we'll be probably softer growth that we've seen and then there's a story of China I mean, as you know without getting into a lot of detail on China I would say to you. The highlights our year on year volumes are flat sequentially up 4% largely because there was a lunar new year in Q1.\n\nBased on what Im seeing I expect Q3 volumes to be flattish to your chemicals electronics.\n\nDemand continues to be soft the government has earlier this week in fact on 24th announced a large intent of.\n\nStimulation of the economy in conjunction but really for our economy that size for us to see any any visible impact of that probably towards the end of the year.\n\nAnd then we're left with EMEA in EMEA volumes I expect it will be consistent icon see anything that suggests that we will see a significant improvement in the second half I believe in Q3 as an example, adjusted for seasonal variations et cetera, Youll see flattish volumes.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAnd then we will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley . Your line is open.\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone, Matt might be overthinking, this a little bit but could you just maybe help me better understand historically your guidance midpoint had assumed.\n\nNo economic growth and now the high end assumes no economic growth. So what caused you to sort of change that framework.\n\nYes.\n\nIf you go back far enough, we have bounced a little bit around on that sometimes high end, sometimes Midland.\n\nIt just gets to a function of when we put the numbers together and we sort of how many quarters, we have left and what we see going on and also the sequential trends will play into that as well. So so right now I'd say, yes at the high end I wouldn't look much further beyond that's just how the numbers are put together that's how the guidance range resulted.\n\nAnd as you well know we're going to continue to do what we do to try and improve on that but right. Now. This is the guidance we have out there and to your exact point those are the base assumptions underlying that.\n\nOkay fair enough if I could just ask on.\n\nOn the pricing equation is there a way we can think about the price you achieved in the second quarter and maybe whats. Your expect you achieved in the third quarter, how much of that is lapping a prior price initiatives versus how much of that is sort of the implementation of new initiatives or is there a way you can help us think through that.\n\nSure Vince.\n\nAs Matt.\n\nThere is always around the world and you have to remember all of our pricing is incredibly local right. It's in the almost 100 countries around the world their individual initiatives.\n\nWe're all done based on individual contracts and so at any point in time, there are always price.\n\nAdjustments actions contractual inflation adjustments occurring everywhere in the world at all times.\n\nAnd so given that.\n\nIt's always going to have a component that carries into the next four quarters or three quarters and thats, what youre going to see so clearly to your point on a lapping basis. When you lap high global inflation periods and you do see this inflation then yes the comps get.\n\nA little tougher that's natural that's normal, especially as what we're seeing in the developed some of the developed nations, but other than that there are continuous price items going on simply because of the contract structures. So I would say well we absolutely expect to carry into next year, we are still seeing .\n\nActions today and remember there are many countries that still have double digit inflation going on right now.\n\nAnd so you have to you have to consider that as well because again, it's a very local approach.\n\nOkay. That's very helpful as usual I really appreciate it.\n\nWe will take our next question from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nHi, good morning, Thanks for taking.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question Julian announced the contracts with one for.\n\nD captivating against us in terms of future opportunities to to be used.\n\nIn Asia can you size the potential there for linear both in terms of backlog.\n\nwill market and future investment needs to include additional investment carbonization or are you agnostic from that standpoint.\n\nSo Patrick let me I didn't quite get your second question, but let me answer the first as well on and then maybe you can repeat that second question, let's start with . So what we announced was a D cap off ASU is now over the last 30 years, we've probably done most of the large customers.\n\nWe feel comfortable running.\n\nOur long term gas supply contract with so I don't think that.\n\nI'd say to you that there is a large market that we're expecting to see walk out on the side remember, we don't necessarily want to use as a way of providing financing to our customers. It's where there is a deeper integration into greater density for us in a particular market and a high quality customer when that mix comes together that.\n\nWhere it make sense for us so we have selective opportunities that we're pursuing we have.\n\nPipeline around that.\n\nI wouldn't say to you that you should expect significant levels of opportunity going into the backlog as a consequence remind me of your second question again.\n\nGot it and Thats just on the second part of my question I know the one highest agreement included investments in de Carbonization and I know you mentioned that network density is the critical part there but.\n\nYou look for additional investment and de Carbonization, if there are future opportunities.\n\nYes.\n\nEither incumbent with customers on Decarbonization, I'd say Patrick.\n\nThe technology portfolio, the operating skill set and where we are incumbent with customers on the industrial side. We think that's right in our wheelhouse, we have great carbon capture technology that we can utilize as we can either find a chemical sink or a sequestration partner to work with and that combination is really helpful. So we continue to do that I think there are some easier.\n\nDecarbonization cases in China as an example, where it's about making sure that we are moving from steam turbine driven.\n\ntwo actually moving to just going on to the grid and using renewable renewable bar, that's the scope to emission reduction as well as better economic case in most cases, so I really what turns out to be a nice win win.\n\nLook and execute those projects.\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe will take our next question from Kevin Mccarthy with vertical research partners. Your line is open.\n\nYes. Good morning on Slide 13, you provided some helpful Pie charts to speak to your backlog composition.\n\nSo just wondering if you could speak to how you would expect those pies to evolve over the next year or two for example.\n\nHe has been quite small historically recent history anyway for understandable reasons, but would you expect that to grow materially as clean energy projects gained traction and curious within Asia Pacific.\n\nWhat is the mix of clean energy versus more traditional projects that youre seeing there and your discussions and how you would expect that to evolve as well.\n\nThanks, Kevin So let me address two points one my expectation of that backlog. The pie itself is that it will continue to grow just to make sure that that's kind of understood, let's talk about the mix a little bit there.\n\nAs you know all the decarbonization piece, we went out and give you guys. Some numbers, saying, we expect over a decade that about $30 billion in the U S and about $50 billion globally. So that is the ratio that I expect I expect the U S or Americas to be around 60% of that decarbonization by and I expect the balance.\n\nto be between EMEA and APAC I do expect larger projects in EMEA. We are working on a number of them in middle East and Europe that I feel pretty good about that are progressing well and I think that.\n\nAs part of that the balance 40% as it were.\n\nI do expect EMEA will have more than its fair share of that I'll also add and tell you that the Asia Pac decarbonization effort is much smaller and slower they are behind the Americas and EMEA by a number of years at this point and I do not see the scale that I've seen in Americas and to some extent in EMEA.\n\nOf those projects as yet and I suspect there are probably three to five years away in terms of getting projects of that scale.\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe will take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nJust a housekeeping question on packaged gases.\n\nPricing for rental fees evolving in Europe and in the U S.\n\nCompared to inflation or is it just sort of moving on.\n\nLow single digit rate, regardless of the background inflation environment or have you been moving it up ahead of inflation.\n\nSo both Europe and the U S package businesses are a reasonably large Morris as you know and we've been very consistent in our rental.\n\nRising actions that have happened over the last few years, So I think we.\n\nEnsure that there is more than recovery of inflation and we continue to have a very consistent policy around that.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd we will take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nYes.\n\nContinuing on the package gasses question.\n\nPost the mix here.\n\nAcquisition, what would you estimate your share of U S packaged gases business.\n\nAnd how would you how would you compare your pricing power in that business now versus liquid bulk and.\n\nAny indications on trends for hard goods and so forth that would give you an outlook for the U S economy.\n\nSure Steve So let me address both of those separately lets talk talk about the packaged gases that makes our acquisition has been extremely good for us we've got a strong footprint in southeast U S, which is seeing a lot of growth in a lot of incoming investments as well so I feel pretty good about where we stand.\n\nMy comment on the market share would be that it isn't high enough. That's what I tell my guys and I'm going to tell you the same thing.\n\nWe don't particularly disclose market share numbers specifically.\n\nBut given the strength of the of the footprint that we have we have strong pricing power. We've demonstrated that over the last many years and that business is actually demonstrating pricing power reflecting into margin improvement consistently over the last many years, so I feel pretty good about where we stand with that.\n\nLet's talk a little bit about hard goods. So hard goods is youre right in pointing out is a good leading indicator.\n\nThe last time, we spoke Ive mentioned that I was seeing a little bit and this is in the last earnings call I've mentioned that we're seeing a little bit of softening on growth I can say to you today, we are seeing a bit of a mixed bag why isn't consumables are seeing some slightly positive growth as far as sales are concerned whereas on equipment sales.\n\nWe are seeing some declines and that is something that you could look at in terms of the amount of manufacturing activity and order books that you have but remember this is also a season, where many of the manufacturers do take.",
    "content2": "So sometimes prior to that we would see a little bit of softening of the market. So I'm not at all I am not going to pass adjustment just yet I'll hold and see what happens beyond September .\n\nThank you and then a question on clean energy can.\n\nJust roughly estimate the sizes of these buckets.\n\nFor you with respect to the opportunity for you obviously, you got a blue energy.\n\nBlue hydrogen production and sales you got green hydrogen, but you also have oxy fuel opportunities for big energy consumers you have I mean based de carbonization projects, how would you size those relative to each other.\n\nIt's the same.\n\nThe best way to describe that opportunity for us just to think about the three buckets that we traditionally talk about let me walk you through them first and then I can tell you where.\n\nCarbon capture is an example plays a role or not so the three buckets that we normally track on mobility.\n\nWe track industrial applications, and we tracked energy carrier energy vector.\n\nAs far as mobility is concerned typically it's about 10% or less of our entire opportunity pipeline multi.\n\nIn some cases long distance to ensure that market that require ammonia and methanol up clean pneumonia methanol have have access to those products.\n\nThat's how I see most of those play out bolted the industrial applications as well as on the energy side, we see a role for carbon capture and sequestration and that's where that that kind of opportunity. Please is a subset of the broader opportunity I mentioned.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd we will now take our final question from John Mcnulty with BMO capital markets. Your line is open.\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question send you a question just as a follow up to one of your earlier answers. You had mentioned that you were seeing some clean hydrogen or clean energy opportunities in the middle East I guess, how would you characterize these are these for domestic use or are they for export and if it's the latter.\n\nYou see subsidies in place, whether it's from Europe , or Asian demand or what have you.\n\nThat would facilitate the economics to make sense for projects like that I guess can you can you help us to think about that.\n\nSure. So we are seeing a couple of opportunities which plan to both those buckets. John So we are seeing carbon capture sequestration opportunity that we are jointly working with around Glen Schlumberger on her feet is undergoing at the moment it should get to early in the new year, we were looking at a very large scope of.\n\nRobin capture in fact, the first phase very currently working on is 11 million tons of C. O. Two a year out of a total project, which may be the world's largest carbon capture and sequestration project in three phases, adding up to 54 million tonnes per animal of C. O two being sequester. So that's a domestic that's driven really around the.\n\nDomestic decarbonization effort that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's pursuing but also seeing projects in the kingdom and elsewhere in the middle East around the development of Blue ammonia.\n\nThe economics of Blue ammonia coming out of coming out of the kingdom or the middle East more broadly is very very competitive. So although there are no direct abroad incentives available there a specific project based incentives that the government will provide and some of that some.\n\nThat product is them used to serve local market I'd say, probably a split about a third to two thirds tutors for export one third for local markets.\n\nBut the product that comes out of Blue ammonia in particular that comes out of the kingdom in other parts of the middle East is very competitive globally.\n\nGot it thanks very much for the color.\n\nAnd I would now like to turn the call back to one plan for any additional or closing remark.\n\nThank you again for participating today's call.\n\nIf you have any further questions. Please feel free to reach out have a safe day take care.\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.\n\n[noise] disconnect."

Welcome to the Lindy first quarter, twenty twenty three earnings teleconference and webcast.\n\nAt this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n\nAnd after the speaker's presentation there will be a question and answer session.\n\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Palayas, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\n\nChris, thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for attending our 2023 first quarter earnings call and webcast.\n\nI'm Juan Villalhos, head of investor relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjeev Lamba, Chief Executive Officer, and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nToday's presentation materials are available on our website at www.lindy.com in the investors section.\n\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.\n\nThe reconciliation of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation.\n\nSanjeev will provide some opening remarks and then Matt will give an update on Lindy's first quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A.\n\nLet me now turn the call over to Sanjay.\n\nThanks, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone.\n\nWe had a strong start to the year as Lindy employees once again delivered on their commitments, irrespective of the geopolitical and economic headwind.\n\nRunnings per share, Operating Margin and Return on Capital all reach new record highs.\n\nrobust pricing, coupled with dependable return on capital, have more than compensated for a weaker economy.\n\nJust like the last four years, Linde's ability to consistently deliver earnings growth in any environment is a testament to the resilient portfolio, operating excellence, and capital discipline.\n\nAnd when global economies recover, which they always do, there's an opportunity to further leverage the base volume growth just as we've demonstrated in 2021.\n\nHowever, during uncertain times like today,\n\nWe continue to execute our strategy.\n\nof optimizing our base business every day, capitalizing on growth projects, including high quality clean energy projects.\n\nAll of this while maintaining our industrial gases model, coupled with a disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nSlide three provides a brief update on clean energy.\n\nincluding key projects that are both under construction and an example of a project being developed.\n\nLet me begin by reiterating our strategy with respect to clean energy. And you'll notice it hasn't changed over the last three years.\n\nwhich it shouldn't.\n\nLet's start with the first principle.\n\nWe will stick to the core of industrial gases model. This has been a cornerstone of our strategy for decades.\n\nWe serve many markets where our customers are experts at what they do.\n\nMaking our customers more productive and competitive through our core strengths is what makes Lindy successful.\n\nThis has been true for the last 100 years, and I expect it will continue to be true for the next 100.\n\nAnother certainty within our industry is how customers demand the same three requirements for the gas supply, which are safety, reliability, and lowest total cost of ownership.\n\nThis holds irrespective of the molecule, the end market or supply mode.\n\nThis is why a key element of our strategy\n\nis to leverage our world-class engineering capabilities and existing asset network of our $3 billion hydrogen business to deliver the most reliable and lowest cost supply systems for our customers.\n\nFollowing these principles, we have successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects of which I'd like to highlight just a few.\n\nThe left side represents projects currently under construction.\n\nThese are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments, and incremental growth with predictable returns.\n\nWith project capex of just under $2 billion,\n\nby capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner ExxonMobil.\n\nCurrently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog, since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore considered base capex. Orby Pro celebration\n\nThere are few projects like the recently announced EVONIC agreement that meet backlog criteria. But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well.\n\nCurrently, we view these electrolysis\n\nelectrolyze the projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen.\n\nthey're often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side.\n\nleveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs.\n\nFurthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies.\n\nto Monique.\n\nSale of plant is another avenue for Lindy to participate in growth opportunities which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network.\n\nNow in addition to these projects being constructed, we have over 200 different projects under development.\n\nOf course, the probability of these projects being approved or won by us varies from project to project.\n\nOn the right side of the slide, I'd like to highlight one such opportunity which was recently made public by our customer. Dow recently announced that it has selected Linde as its industrial gas partner for supply of clean hydrogen and nitrogen.\n\nfor its proposed net-zero carbon emissions integrated ethylene cracker site in Alberta, Canada.\n\nUnder the framework agreement, Lindy will complete the design and engineering for a Lindy owned and operated world scale air separation, auto thermal reformer and carbon capture complex.OPE is already funding the most trusted oil and correct aid discovery and production of course, it's a conference of the densest of scientists there. In addition to the\n\nThis complex will potentially be integrated with Lindy's existing operations in Alberta.\n\nEngineering work is underway and both companies are working to obtain their respective board approvals and regulatory approvals.\n\nfinal investment decision is anticipated by end of the year. So I don't really have\n\nmany additional details until then.\n\nWe continue to work on a number of other projects aligned with our strategy.\n\nto decarbonize our own operations.\n\nhelp customers decarbonize their operations, such as the DAO project above.\n\nand address new market needs such as the OCI project.\n\nOverall, the total opportunities are likely to exceed $50 billion over the next decade.\n\nRepresenting one of the best long-term growth environments I've seen in a long time.\n\nOf course, time will tell how many we ultimately sign and announce.\n\nBut you can see we are making meaningful progress. And despite the many differences across these projects,\n\nOur full suite of offerings coupled with a strong balance sheet will enable us to win more than our fair share.\n\nsuite of offerings coupled with a strong balance sheet will enable us to win more than our fair share. But rest assured...\n\nThanks Sanjeev.\n\nPlease turn to slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The sales of $8.2 billion were flat with last year.\n\nbut up 4% sequentially.\n\nversus prior year, FX was a 3% headwind.\n\nalthough we continue to see foreign currencies strengthen as evidenced by the sequential tailwind.\n\nCost pass-through was also a headwind.\n\nas energy prices have fallen in most parts of the world. As a reminder, we pass through power and natural gas costs contractually, which have no effect on profit dollars, but will impact profit margins.\n\nNet divestitures resulted in a 2% decrease.\n\nas the sale of GIST and deconsolidation of Russia more than offset the recent NEX-AIR acquisition in the United States.\n\nEngineering is down 2% since we have not lapped the impact from sanctioned Russian projects.\n\nwhich ceased Q2 of last year.\n\nExcluding these items, underlined sales increased 8% from last year and 3% sequentially.\n\nInflation levels remain elevated in most countries and thus are driving higher pricing. As mentioned in prior calls, globally weighted inflation tends to be the best proxy for our price changes.\n\nsince most contracts have clauses that specifically address local inflation.\n\nVolumes were flat from prior year as contribution from project startups offset lower base volumes.\n\nWhen looking at segment-based volumes, Americas are growing due to the U.S. APAC is mostly flat since volume recovery is offset by prior year equipment sales.\n\nAnd EMEA is lower, primarily from on-site customers adjusting to slower economic conditions.\n\nFrom a supply mode perspective, we continue to see resilient or growing packaged and merchant volumes.\n\nalthough certain on-site customers are lower from a combination of weaker conditions and planned turnarounds.\n\nSequential volumes are flat as US pipeline recovery from Q4 weather offsets seasonal slowdown in APAC and Latin America.\n\nDespite flat volumes, operating profit of $2.2 billion increased 16% from prior year and 10% sequentially.\n\nThis growth was driven by project startups and prudent inflation management.\n\nthrough price increases and cost\n\nAnd you can see to the right that every segment contributed to this improvement.\n\nIn the appendix, you will notice the engineering segment once again delivered an operating margin in excess of 25 percent. Of the low to mid teens, we view as a long-term run rate.\n\nSimilar to last quarter, this is due to favorable timing from the wind down of sanctioned projects. While this led to favorable benefits on the income statement, it also resulted in unfavorable cash timing, which I'll discuss on the next slide.\n\nFor the next few quarters, engineering results may continue to be lumpy as we wind down the remaining projects.\n\nHowever, we did not include any potential profit upside in the earnings guidance. EPS of $3.42 was 17% above last year or 20% higher when excluding the effects of currency.\n\nThis represents the tenth quarter in a row of growing EPS XFX.\n\n20% or more. From a cash flow perspective, CapEx increased 28% from growth investments in both base and project CapEx.\n\nFurthermore, ROC reached another record at 24%.\n\nas we continue to deliver double digit percent profit growth on a stable capital base.\n\nSlide 5 provides more details on the first quarter capital management.\n\nWhile cash trends are relatively steady, the Q1 operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio was 64% or 11% lower than last year.\n\nThe majority of this difference relates to timing of engineering working capital, both from a reduction in contract liabilities and from a reduction in contract liabilities.\n\nand an outflow from accruals and payables. It said differently, we met a contractual milestone this quarter and thus booked current income related to a customer cash deposit received over a year ago.\n\nIn addition, we paid third-party vendors for work related to that project.\n\nNormally, you wouldn't experience a cash flow swing of this magnitude.\n\nbut the lumpy and accelerated wind downs of sanctioned projects are creating this effect.\n\nExcluding engineering timing, working capital levels remain quite healthy across the company.\n\n80% range, but the next few quarters could be more volatile as we continue to wind down remaining projects.\n\nAnd recall, this ratio in 2021 was 96% driven by customer repayments related to these sanctioned projects.\n\nbreeding cash flow less BaseCap-X is stable at approximately $1.5 billion per quarter.\n\nshare repurchases as part of our stated capital allocation policy.\n\nwith guidance on slide six. For full year 2023, we're raising guidance 30 cents at the bottom and top end.\n\nfor a new range of $13.45 to $13.85.\n\nThis represents a growth rate of 9% to 13% versus 2022.\n\nfor now. In addition, and consistent with our prior approach, this assumes no economic improvement and hence no base volume improvement.\n\nThis does not represent our macro projection, but rather is just a placeholder.\n\nSo you can insert your own view of the economy and adjust accordingly. If the economy improves, we'll be above this range. And if not, we'll take actions to mitigate.\n\nThe second quarter EPS guidance range is $3.40 to $3.50.\n\nrepresenting 10% to 13% growth from 2022, or 11% to 14% when excluding a 1% FX headwind. Similar to the full year, this assumes no economic improvement from current levels, although on a sequential basis it reflects some seasonal recovery.\n\ncost, and capital discipline.\n\nBut regardless of how the year unfolds, we're highly confident we can continue to deliver compound value for our shareholders.\n\nby executing on the basics and\n\nsecuring high quality customer contracts for long-term growth.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A. Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then 1 on your telephone keypad.\n\nOur first question is from Mike Leithardt with Barclays. Your line is open. First question I wanted to focus on a Maya segment. Can you just speak to the step change in profitability here this quarter? I appreciate you don't really give segment level guidance but...\n\nThe business used to be running, call it, $300, $400 million quarterly EBIT. We averaged around $500 million a quarter last year. Now in a pretty uneven macro environment, we broke $600. So is this sort of the run rate going forward or is there something else kind of underlying this step up here?\n\nSure, Mike. Let me start off by just kind of going back and telling you how the EMEA business has been looking at actions they need to take, management actions. So the underlying impact that we're seeing come through is driven by two levers, pricing and productivity.\n\nProductivity are actions that they've been undertaking for an extended period of time, as you're aware. We've talked about it over the last couple of years now. They've reset their cost base effectively and continue to do that every quarter.\n\nThat obviously has an impact on the run rate that you're seeing going forward. But more importantly, we're obviously seeing some upside from pricing come through.\n\nAnd you might recall, if you go back late 2021, when inflation started moving up, we'd explain to you that there is a catch up that happens around pricing, particularly around merchant and package businesses. Of course, in the current environment, when energy costs are coming down, as an example.\n\nWe're getting some uplift as a result of that as well, which you can see in that pricing number, pretty impressive 13% that they've posted. So, you have to keep those in account as you think about EMEA's business, but underlying performance driven primarily around pricing and productivity.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe next question is from Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nHi everyone, I wanted to ask a little bit more about this 50 billion dollar opportunity that you're talking about now in terms of clean hydrogen. I think two quarters back when you talked about that greater than 30 billion opportunity, you're talking about the US alone, but you broke it down into those three buckets of decarbonized Linda, decarbonized customers and new markets.\n\nSo I was wondering if you could do the same on this expanded, this extra 20 billion, which I guess is outside of the US and perhaps in terms of geography, you could talk about where you expect to see the most momentum in the next couple of years in terms of project signings. Thanks. Thanks, Nicola. So again, just to remind you, I talked about earlier in my talk,\n\nindustrial applications, the ones in our wheelhouse, the ones where we are currently working with existing industrial customers to help them decarbonize, and then the last piece is really around energy and power where hydrogen or its carrier, ammonia or methanol, will play a role. So let's split them down in, when I think about the 50%, 50% of the world's energy is in the oil industry,\n\n30 billion plus in the US, driven of course with momentum coming out of the IRA, driving a lot of that development. So you see the balance 20 odd billion that we're talking about outside of the US. We're seeing growth opportunities in our pipeline out of the Middle East.\n\nWe're seeing growth opportunities come out of mainland Europe , some in the UK, and then we're seeing a little bit of a build-up happen out of Australia and Asia, and it does look like they'll be behind the curve relative to what the US and Europe is likely to see.\n\nThe next question is from Jeff Zajkowski with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nIn late January , ExxonMobil indicated that it wanted to build a hydrogen facility or hydrogen complex in the United States.\n\nThat would generate about a billion standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, which is...\n\ngigantic. Can you talk about how you see the hydrogen market evolving in North America now that it seems that ExxonMobil wants to enter it? Do you see other integrated oil companies as entering the hydrogen market as well? Do you see them?\n\nselling hydrogen in a way that's different from the way you sell it? Can you give us an idea of what that market looks like over the next few years?\n\nway you sell it. Can you give us an idea of what that market looks like over the next few years, competitively?\n\nSoja!\n\nSo, as you think about the evolution of the hydrogen market, there are three aspects to keep in mind.\n\nThe first that a lot of the development around clean hydrogen is driven through a range of partnerships. And you'll recall when Lindy laid out our strategy, we said that partnerships are a key component of that. And you heard me speak earlier and mention that ExxonMobil will be a partner for us.\n\nof those developments and we are actually partnering with a number of players including IOCs and NOCs that have an intent to try and develop their own projects around hydrogen because they lean on us to provide either technology, operating experience or indeed sometimes the benefit of our network. So that's one. Another approach that we now take is the smart technology infrastructure. Any tips?\n\nThe second thing to keep in mind is we have the ability to leverage our existing\n\nAnd really, I think that's where a competitive advantage for Lindy turns up. Very often, other partners or potential partners reach out to us because they recognize the impact and advantage that we carry as a result of that infrastructure investment and want to partner with us as well. So that's the other piece to kind of keep in mind. Last, a number of players will want to decarbonize their operations. And what you're speaking about, the specific example, Jeff, is driven around\n\ndecarbonization of their operations in Baytown.\n\nHere, what they're attempting to do is to actually produce significant hydrogen. You mentioned one billion scuffs. A large portion, if not most of that, will actually go into decarbonizing their own operations. Obviously, the support from 45Q makes that more attractive, makes that hydrogen.\n\ngoing in as an input into their crackers, into their chemical systems, downstream and to the refining systems, a lot more attractive from a pricing point of view. And you're seeing that is the development that's happening. I'm pretty hopeful that we will have a role to play in those projects that\n\npeople like ExxonMobil and others will undertake through the provision of our technology and operating capabilities as well.\n\nAnd Jeff, this is Matt, maybe just one other thing I'd add. You know, I think another way to think about it is when you look at the hydrocarbon market today for sort of transportation and energy, it's somewhere in the order of a $6 trillion market. You know, my number may not be exact, but it's something in that order. And when you look at the industrial gas industry, our participation in that market is a fraction of a percent.\n\nSo in my view, a lot of that $6 trillion market is what is being addressed and potentially converted to things like hydrogen. And so if that happens, I think that actually creates opportunities in areas that we had a very, very small participation in in the past. But time will ultimately tell.\n\nThank you. The next question is from Duffy Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nYeah good morning. Two questions really. One around the projects. So you know the OCI, the Dow, roughly what would be the cadence you would expect announcements like that over the next three or four years? Is it three or four a year? Is it more than that?\n\noff by just talking about the clean energy projects and I think the important thing to remember there is that these projects have a life cycle that they need to go through before they get announced. There is no way to predict what...\n\ntypes of announcements and frequency of announcements you will see on these projects. I think it's important to maybe remind you of just the project development stages they go through. So typically a project of this size will go through a feasibility study followed by a pre-feed, followed by a feed, which is where you actually get to a point.\n\nwith the complex project stretching up to two and a half years.\n\nBeyond that, you would then see another two and a half to three years in execution before final startup happens. So that's the way I think about the frequency that you would expect to see projects. These projects have been under development for a while and you kind of continue to see those announcements reflecting the different stages these projects are at. And as far as the guidance, Duffy.\n\nis we continue to internally focus on a model that can quickly adapt to whatever does happen. And clearly we're seeing inflation continue to be elevated and we need to make sure that we can locally manage that through our contract structures to capture that inflation through pricing.\n\nto make sure that we can continue to stay on top of that. On the volume side, we are well positioned to capture when it recovers. As you know, we are a contractual business. As Sanjeev mentioned, we demonstrated that in 2021 with the recovery. If and when that comes back, we will be very well positioned to do that. But for now, we just left out this sort of\n\nThank you guys.\n\nThe next question is from David Baglider with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. The next question is from David Baglider with Deutsche Bank.\n\nThank you, good morning. Sanjeev and Matt, just on EMEA pricing, with energy prices now falling, how should that flow through the energy price or the pricing realization?\n\nin Q2 and the rest of the year. So David, I'd mentioned briefly when responding to Michael, you're on that.\n\nIn terms of pricing, as we've explained before, I'll take a step back and just remind you that when we think about pricing, we think about a pass-through mechanism, that is the onsite contracts, where we have a direct correlation between what happens to costs and energy costs in particular, but inflation and how we pass that through.\n\nthe balance is all through a pricing mechanism. We'd explained previously, as inflation was picking up in 2021, that there is usually a lag that happens at the beginning of that cycle.\n\nWe're now at the back end of that cycle where you're seeing energy costs go down. And again, that same lag applies over here. We've said the lag is between one to two quarters, and we're seeing a little bit of that lag and benefiting us, of course, in terms of the pricing that we're seeing on the merchant and packet side of our business.\n\nOf course, pricing takes a lot of hard work, as I've said previously on a number of occasions, and our team over there has done a tremendous job in making sure that we continue to push that base price through. And of course, instances where we've had surcharges, to the extent possible, we have a continuous process of converting those surcharges into base product pricing, ensuring that we have...\n\nThose price numbers, that pricing action, take longer term as well.\n\nVery good. And just on mayo volumes, do you expect mayo volumes to be down for the rest of the year in all three quarters?\n\nOn the on-site, I'd have to say sequentially, we are seeing a little bit of a pickup. It's slight, particularly around metals and steel production in EMEA. So there is a little bit of a movement. Sequentially, on-site volumes are up just a little bit. So that's kind of on the on-site side.\n\nAnd as that happens, we will see some volume leverage come through in the rest of the year. Of course, we're tracking this carefully. I'm not going to try and predict what's likely to happen in Europe given the many factors that are at play. But if that happens, we are well positioned to kind of find the leverage around a base volume growth that's likely to happen as a consequence. Thank you very much.\n\nThe next question is from Peter Clark with Société Générale. Your line is open. Yes, good morning everyone. Thank you. Two questions. First, back on the pricing and the sequential price you're still getting. In America is the question. One of your competitors was mentioning a big kick up in medical gas pricing and I think that was led by the Americas for them as well.\n\nSo I'm just wondering if your medical gas price has seen the kicker or you're already ahead of the pack on that. And then the second question around Europe and the cylinder business, you've alluded to the fact it's been doing pretty well, certainly on the pricing and the margin side. I'm just wondering if it's leading that because again, you know, we're hearing it's still very robust on pricing. The volumes for your competitors are also pretty good.\n\nin Europe on the cylinder side. So just wondering if that is a real driver between that margin kit you're seeing underlying in Europe . Thank you. Thanks Peter. So on pricing, I can say to you that you've seen robust pricing over the last three quarters consistently across all our segments. And I think we're pretty happy with.\n\nhow pricing is played out. I'm not going to get into the details around what is specifically happening around medical or healthcare fees. I do not cross the board. Most of our businesses, most end markets have seen strong pricing growth, and I think we're pretty satisfied with where we are and we tend to lead the industry as far as that pricing growth is concerned.\n\nIn Europe package, that's a great question. I think we've watched this very carefully. The good news is on the volume side, those volumes have been holding well and have been very resilient through the last 18 months or so. So that's really been an important piece.\n\nPricing has been very good. I mentioned EMEA pricing more broadly. Clearly the package side of that has benefited from that as well and has shown strong pricing performance over that entire period, including the first quarter that we are now referencing. I certainly expect to see, you know, as industrial activity picks up. So an important factor in all of that was stability in energy costs.\n\nThat seems to be in place at the moment, Peter. I think it's still open what longer term impacts there might be, but at least in the short to medium term, we are seeing that stability play a role in some level of a very slight pickup, if you will, in industrial activity across the board. And that certainly helps the merchant and package business. So I would expect to see that volume trend.\n\nplay out as we see those developments continue. Thank you. The next question is from Steve Byrne with Think of America. Your line is open. Yes, thank you. Would like to better understand the mechanisms by the pass through cost. Is there a month or multiple months delay in how\n\neffect, these two things combined, did they represent some operating profit in those regions in the first quarter that really was just driven by lag.\n\nLet me start off by just kind of providing a headline that says as far as pass-through is concerned, there is no impact on our operating profit in dollar terms. It kind of adds to the top and doesn't add anything to the OP and when it's on its way down as it is at the moment, it goes away from the top and doesn't add any dollars from an OP point of view. Of course, it does impact the margin numbers and the mathematical computation of the margin does improve as a consequence of that when you're on a down cycle as far as.\n\nSo there isn't any significant lag, as I mentioned, on the pricing action for merchant and package where there tends to be a lag of one to two quarters. Not in the case of pass-through. Okay. Thank you. The next question is from Michael Sisson with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. Just to follow up on the clean energy opportunities, how much of your sale of gas backlog is clean energy now? And then if you're successful in winning your fair share, how big do you think that backlog will be for clean energy down the road? And is there a limit on how much you can put in your backlog?\n\nSo Mike, at the moment, I think I referenced this earlier, we've got about just under $2 billion. That's what the slide would show you in the sale of gas. We've got about just under $2 billion of backlog coming out of decarbonizing projects, if you will. That's what we're looking at in DARPA, $3.8B.\n\nOur expectation is that in the next two to three years, we will be making investment decisions anywhere between nine to $10 billion worth. This is based on the projects we're developing, which are further advanced than others, and those decisions, depending on the ones that we pursue — we're making book news of the actions they take to make businesses more efficient for businesses.\n\nand sign up, will then get moved into the backlog and would then start providing the impact that we look for once they start up in due course.\n\nSo you can expect the backlog to continue to grow. I do not expect it to peak up and down. I expect it to be a reasonably steady growth in the backlog over the years ahead. And those decisions that we make in clean energy projects that I've referenced before of anywhere between $9 to $10 billion over the next few years.\n\nI just wanted to ask on the buyback.\n\nI would have guessed given the delisting from Frankfurt and the big cash balance at the end of the year that you might have put more money to work in the first quarter in the buyback, but it didn't look like you had to. Given that you're still sitting with a pretty large cash balance, I guess you did the cash balance, and I don't want to\n\nto package gas acquisition, but how are you thinking about using that cash balance and the incremental capital you generate in free cash flow that's here in terms of return of capital to shareholders?\n\nacquisition, but how are you thinking about using that cash balance and the incremental capital you generate in free cash flow that's here in terms of return of capital to shareholders? Sure, Vincent. This is Matt.\n\nSpecifically to Q1, you may recall for pretty much the month of January , we were officially blacked out from any buybacks at all, given the nature of the merger structure that was used to do the D-list. So we lost about a month or so, and therefore we had less days to act.\n\nBut we did get pretty, I would say, aggressive leading right up to it as we saw some good opportunity there. But looking forward, it really is just going to be a consistent approach to our longstanding, steady, simple capital allocation model. And to reiterate for those on the call,\n\nIt starts with our underlying mandate, which is we're going to maintain a single A rating and row the dividend every year. That is a mandate. And then our priority after meeting that mandate is to invest in the business. And that is anything that meets our investment criteria. It's acquisitions, it's DCAPs, it's projects, it's Space CapEx. We treat them the same as we should because these are long-term investments and we need to evaluate them on risk return against our core model.\n\nAnd then whatever's left over is going to be buybacks. So based on our current cash profiles, we continue to have substantial capital left over and therefore we will be buying in the market pretty much almost every day. And as we continue to see opportunities, we'll step that up.\n\nBut that capital allocation policy will be very consistent through good macro times and bad macro times. And that's something that you can rely on for us through the long haul.\n\nGreat. Thanks for the update. The next question is from Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning. This is Dan Rizwan with Lawrence. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned earlier I think about your outlook having...\n\nNo, not assuming any really improvement in the macro environment. I don't know if I missed this, but can you meet your guidance if the macro environment in North America in particular significantly weakens?\n\nSure, this is Matt, I can handle that. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and first of all, our approach is very consistent in how we've been approaching this for the last couple years, frankly. And we believe our view of the economy is not going to be any more accurate than anyone else's. So we'll just put a baseline there and no improvement and let you put your house view in whatever that may be.\n\nSo in the case of if the macro deteriorates, we will take actions to mitigate. You know, clearly we saw that in 2020 and we took actions and you may recall our full year EPS growth rate in 2020 was close to 12% growth rate. So those actions did help mitigate what was a pretty unexpected macro decline from the pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, last year in 2022, we saw some macro softness related to the energy crisis and obviously the invasion. And so given those, we have a track record of being able to act in case those disruptions happen. And as I mentioned to Duffy, that's how we build our operating rhythm is to be able to quickly respond when things are different in the macro than what was expected. So I view this the same.\n\nYour line is open.\n\nYes, good morning. Sanjiv, can you provide an update on your carbon offtake strategy? Last quarter, I think you indicated you were in discussions with three companies and earlier this month we learned that you've chosen to partner with ExxonMobil.\n\nMy understanding is that partnership relates to OCI bullmon specifically. So a couple of questions would be, you know, in the case of future blue hydrogen projects, do you need to navigate the offtake each time on a case-by-case basis? And also, can you comment on the costs and recovery of those?\n\nstorage, the capture and storage of CO2, particularly for blue hydrogen projects in the US.\n\nAnd really that's driven around the IRA benefits that come out of 45Q, providing that $85 per ton of CO2 to be captured and sequestered.\n\nAnd the two models I mentioned was a tipping fee, i.e. where Lindy would arm the capture and would create a pipeline that would then provide that CO2 to a partner who would take a tipping fee and sequester and manage that storage on the ground.\n\nThe other option was for us to sell the CO2 that we have and allow the partner to take the benefit of whatever tax credits that come as part of the 45Q through their ownership of the carbon capture and sequestration process and the assets that they build in order to achieve that.\n\nWe'd mentioned that we were in conversations with a number of players, and as you read from the announcement, we selected and worked with ExxonMobil to continue down that path. That's where the OCI – the CO2 coming out of the OCI assets and the production of Blue Hydrogen.\n\nwould be passed on or off taken by ExxonMobil and sequestered by them and managed long term. As we think about new projects and that we are currently developing, we have an opportunity to work with partners including ExxonMobil and others to look at it on a case by case basis.",

Welcome to the Linde Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nVP of IR, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2022 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's fourth quarter financial performance and outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A.\nLet me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO & Director, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. By all measures, 2022 was another successful year for Linde despite the significant and unprecedented headwinds. I'm incredibly proud how every employee rose to the challenge by not only delivering record financial performance but also living our core values and supporting key initiatives for all stakeholders. And while there are hundreds of daily examples where Linde employees have created real value through their commitment and determination, I'd like to highlight just a few on Slide 3.\nStarting with shareholders. We delivered record financial performance against the backdrop of an energy and inflation crisis not seen in half a century. 3 important metrics for our owners: operating margin, EPS and ROC, all reached record highs both for the fourth quarter and the full year. In fact, we achieved our ninth quarter in a row of growing EPS ex FX by 20% or more. On top of that, $7 billion, almost 5% of our average market cap, was returned to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe also expanded shareholder focus beyond fundamental results by identifying persistent technical constraints on Linde's stock valuation. The Board recommended a solution to simplify our exchange listing, which is approved by an overwhelming majority of shareholders.\nHowever, achieving sustainable long-term value creation requires more than just a commitment to our owners. We need to successfully integrate all stakeholders, including employees, customers and the very communities we operate in. So on the environmental front, we continue to make great progress, and 2022 was no exception.\nLooking at the numbers. We added 50 additional 0-waste sites in 2022, reaching 760 sites around the globe. We reduced absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by over 1 million tonnes of CO2 versus 2021 despite growing volumes. This is a good start towards our stated goal of reducing 35% greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, which was recently validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\nIn addition, through the use of our technology, products and services, we help customers avoid more than 2x the CO2 emissions from our operational footprint. These achievements have been recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, CDP and several other independent organizations. And we're not only committed to reducing our own carbon footprint, but we're also playing a major role in the global energy transition, which I'll cover later.\nOf course, none of this is possible without the commitment of our employees. When I measure performance and human capital, I first look to our long-standing company values of safety, integrity, inclusion, community and accountability. Our safety performance continues to be best in class as defined by a double-digit improvement over 2021 in lost workday cases and commercial vehicle incidents.\nCreating a diverse and inclusive environment where employees can achieve their full potential remains a priority for us. In support of this commitment, Linde has recently implemented a number of development programs across the enterprise. We're currently at 28% for gender diversity, and I fully expect us to exceed 30% by 2030 across the entire organization.\nThe local nature of our business has also enabled over 500 different community engagement projects, an increase of 25% from 2021. Linde donated more than $10 million to support various charitable and STEM programs, including over $2 million in support of our Ukrainian employees and relief efforts. These highlights represent only a handful of accomplishments during the challenging 2022. However, here at Linde, we have a relentless focus on how to improve, including better positioning ourselves for the future. And while we've had 4 great years since the merger, I'm even more optimistic looking ahead.\nThe $9.2 billion project backlog, which we define as contractual growth project with secured returns, increased $2.4 billion versus the third quarter due to our OCI win, which I'll talk about shortly. Additionally, 2022 was another record year for small on-site wins as the 52 new contracts will provide secured revenue for the next decade or more.\nWith this in mind, for 2023, we expect to invest almost $5 billion in CapEx and acquisitions across all 3 supply modes, enabling high-quality growth while increasing asset density and reliability. Furthermore, we expect to start up over $2 billion in sale of gas projects this year, including our $1.4 billion project with ExxonMobil in Singapore. You'll recall that this project is expected to start up in phases beginning this summer. Therefore, we'll remove it from the backlog sometime during the middle of this year.\nOf course, it's difficult to talk about growth today without mentioning key secular drivers. I'd like to remind everyone that a few years ago, we stated how we would leverage the secular driver of electronics capacity expansions and win more than our fair share of high-quality projects. Our current project backlog of Tier 1 electronics customers validates that strategy as we continue to lead the industry.\nI view clean energy opportunities as being no different. I expect to win more than our fair share of high-quality projects across the energy transition spectrum. We are already partnering with global leaders and actively developing large-scale projects with contractual terms and conditions and scope that you've become accustomed to with Linde.\nThis approach is consistent with what I mentioned last quarter. Of course, it never hurts to reiterate. First, we intend to partner with subsurface experts for all underground operations. We're not geologists. Secondly, all projects will follow our investment criteria. In other words, earn a commensurate return for the risk undertaken. And finally, we will stick to our core, which is management of industrial gases. We have no interest to own or speculate on globally traded chemicals. Rather, we'll have offtakers for our products.\nOur recent win with OCI perfectly aligns with these principles, which you can find on Slide 4. We will invest $1.8 billion as the long-term supplier of nitrogen and blue hydrogen into OCI's ammonia facility with terms and conditions and a return profile consistent with our traditional on-site contracts. OCI is an expert in ammonia production, logistics and marketing, something Linde doesn't want to engage in. In addition, we are partnering with a world-class oil and gas company for the CO2 sequestration.\nThis blue hydrogen project is a great start, and we have several more large-scale energy projects under development. These opportunities follow our traditional gas model and involve partners that are global leaders in their space.\nIn addition, we will continue to execute in our base business, managing pricing, productivity and increasing density across all 3 supply modes because we recognize that our owners appreciate the resilience of the industrial gas model.\nOverall, 2022 was another stellar year despite the many headwinds. We achieved new highs across several key financial metrics whilst relentlessly focusing on our core values. This is the fourth year in a row of double-digit EPS growth, and I see no reason why this won't continue. Stated simply, I have confidence that we will deliver strong results irrespective of economic and geopolitical climate. From my vantage point, I've never been more confident about Linde's future.\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.\n\nMatthew J. White\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.9 billion were down 5% from prior year and 10% sequentially. Note that underlying sales increased 7% year-on-year but decreased 2% sequentially. So there are several moving parts distorting the trends.\nFirst, you can see FX down 6% year-on-year due to the strong U.S. dollar. This trend has already started to reverse as evidenced by the flat sequential impact. I'll speak to guidance at the end, but based on current FX levels, we might have some upside going forward.\nDivestitures from GIST and the deconsolidation of Russia resulted in a 4% and 2% headwind when compared to prior year and the third quarter. We'll have part of this in June and the rest in September, although I do expect a sequential tailwind in the first quarter from our U.S. acquisition of nexAir.\nThe engineering business decreased 4% from last year and 3% sequentially. The prior year variance is driven by Russian projects, and the sequential decline is from timing of a U.S. project. I expect a few more quarters of engineering volatility as they resolve and subsequently lap suspended Russian projects. While we ceased all Russian activity in July of 2022, we continue to reconcile balance sheet liabilities upon reaching settlements with our vendors and former customers.\nCost pass-through trends are starting to stabilize with a 2% increase over last year but 3% drop sequentially. As you know, this represents the contractual pass-through of energy costs and has no effect on operating profit dollars. However, this will impact operating margins as we gross up or down sales and variable costs.\nThe volume is down 1% from last year and 4% sequentially. This prior year, economic weakness in EMEA and severe weather conditions in the U.S. more than offset growth in APAC and project start-ups. Most of the slower volume came from pipeline customers. So there's a larger impact to sales than profit given the contractual fixed payments.\nVersus the third quarter, the volume decline is coming from weather impact to U.S. pipeline customers, EMEA's softer economy and normal seasonal impacts from Southern Hemisphere LPG. We saw a larger-than-normal amount of U.S. pipeline customer outages toward the end of the quarter from weather. This mostly occurred in December, but the vast majority of customers are back to their seasonal run rates. Therefore, this is not expected to be an issue going forward.\nPricing actions remain robust with an 8% increase from 2021 and 2% from the third quarter. These increases are broad-based and aligned with the weighted inflation rate. Operating profit of $2 billion resulted in a record 25.3% operating margin. Excluding pass-through, operating margins expanded both sequentially and year-over-year in all gas segments as pricing effects, net of cost inflation continue to improve underlying business quality.\nThe Engineering segment had an abnormally high operating margin this quarter due to favorable project timing. Recall that Engineering follows a percent of completion accounting method. Customer cash deposits are held on the balance sheet as liabilities until we have the contractual right to bill the customer, at which point the liability is recognized on the income statement as revenue.\nThis quarter, we settled a large contract, enabling us to retain all related cash deposits, thus recognizing the remaining liability as current period revenue. I do not expect this margin to be sustainable beyond this quarter.\nA lot of you are likely wondering how to model Engineering going forward given the recent performance. I believe the best approach is to use the sale of plant backlog as the next 3 to 4 years of revenue with average profit margin in the low- to mid-teen percent. During times of rising backlog, cash inflows and margins tend to be higher. Whereas in a declining backlog, it's usually the opposite.\nHowever, the current situation is deviating from this pattern due to the significant project wind down from sanctions. So we still may have a few more volatile quarters ahead.\nEPS of $3.16 increased 14% from last year or 20% excluding FX. As Sanjiv mentioned, this is the ninth quarter in a row of 20% or more EPS growth ex FX. Operating cash flow is down versus prior year and sequentially. This is almost entirely driven by engineering project timing.\nPlease turn to Slide 6 for a review of 2022 capital management. Operating cash flow was $9 billion for 2022 or 82% of EBITDA, consistent with our multiyear average. The business continues to deliver steady levels of cash in any economic environment.\nYou can see to the right how we invested that cash, aligned with our stated capital allocation policy of growing the dividend, reinvesting in the business and using leftover cash for share repurchases. During the year, we invested $3.3 billion while returning $7.5 billion back to shareholders. We anticipate a meaningful step up in 2023 for new business investments while raising the dividend and maintaining a healthy share repurchase program.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 7. For the first quarter, we're providing an EPS range of $3.05 to $3.15, an increase of 4% to 8% versus prior year or 9% to 13% when excluding FX. Sequentially, this range assumes that recovering U.S. pipeline volumes and an acquisition are mostly offset by China seasonality and lower engineering profit.\nFull year guidance is expected in the range of $13.15 to $13.55, representing an increase of 7% to 10% or 9% to 12% when excluding an estimated 2% FX headwind. Both ranges assume no material change in economic conditions at the midpoint. Furthermore, we're estimating a 4% FX headwind for the first half year and flat for the second half, although recent trends have been better.\nAt this time, we believe it's appropriate to remain cautious against the backdrop of an uncertain environment. If the economy grows, we'll have upside. And if not, we'll take actions to mitigate like we did in 2020 and 2022. Our job of management is not to predict what will happen, but instead, execute in a volatile world and deliver on our commitments.\nI'll now turn the call to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Linde plc Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nVP of IR, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Cecilia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for attending our 2022 third quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation.\nSanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's third quarter financial performance and outlook. After which, we will wrap up with Q&A.\nLet me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO & Director, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Linde employees once again delivered a strong quarter despite the economic challenges. EPS increased 21%, excluding FX, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points when adjusting for contractual cost pass-through, all underpinned by $2.6 billion of operating cash flow and a record ROC of 21.8%.\nNow in addition to achieving this financial performance, the company recently received approval for its absolute emission reduction targets by the science-based targets initiative, confirming our road map to help decarbonize the planet.\nI'm pleased to see these results which are truly a testament to the quality of our team and our relentless execution culture. These financial results highlight both the resilience and growth capabilities of the business in any environment. In times like these, it's important to remind investors of our stable and diversified growth trends, which you can find on Slide 3.\nWe continue to experience robust underlying sales growth this quarter, with each business segment growing double digit versus last year. Resilient end markets, which make up about 1/3 of sales, are collectively growing double-digit percent with food, beverage and electronics up almost 20% and health care slightly down from prior year pandemic volumes.\nOur gases are critical for the production and packaging of everyday consumer items such as food, carbonated beverages, respiratory applications and electronic components. These volumes track to broad consumption levels rather than specific technologies or trends. So they are quite stable even during volatile economic periods.\nFurthermore, despite what you may be reading in the news, we continue to see healthy supplies of gases into electronics fabs in every region. In fact, our total electronics project backlog increased to $1.4 billion after recently being awarded a second large sale of gas contract for a major semiconductor manufacturer in the U.S.\nThe bottom half of the table provides the trends for the more cyclical end markets. And similar to electronics, these trends probably don't align with what you're hearing and reading. Recall that a significant portion of these sales are underpinned by fixed payment structures independent of customer volumes, including on-site fees and cylinder rentals. It's important to note that we spend a lot of time on contract language to ensure our returns are protected and force majeure clauses are absolutely clear.\nI won't speak for the industry, but I have confidence in the strength of Linde contracts. We've demonstrated this through countless regional and global challenges, including the most recent pandemic, and so I don't see today being any different.\nIn addition, a large portion of our customers represent the most competitive in their markets, with assets that tend to be the last ones running.\nA disciplined, long-term approach to capital allocation continues to be validated during these challenging times.\nAnd almost 60% of sales, the cyclical end markets are also up double-digit percent. While growth is broad-based, we continue to see strength in mining for battery materials; merchant hydrogen sales; aerospace, including commercial space; and general manufacturing, especially in Americas. In fact, the U.S. continues to be our best growth market as a combination of natural resource security, consumer resiliency and a strong dollar to support further economic expansion. This is especially true for the Gulf Coast, which is experiencing one of the highest investment activity in quite some time, driven by lower cost energy and the ability to economically decarbonize with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which you can find on the next slide, 4.\nThe IRA has accelerated significant growth prospects from our unrivaled hydrogen and atmospheric gas network as well as potential new markets being developed across the U.S. With this effect, we've grouped these activities into 3 different categories of Decarbonized Linde, Decarbonized Customers and New Markets.\nLet me start with Decarbonized Linde, which represents the ability to sequester existing CO2 emissions generated from our own hydrogen production. This provides simultaneous benefits: the production and supply of blue hydrogen into our network and the reduction of Scope 1 emissions for our stated sustainability goals. The potential investment to Decarbonize Linde exceeds $3 billion while considering our existing hydrogen production asset base.\nThe second category of Decarbonize Customers represents 2 separate opportunities. The first, to enable our customers to decarbonize their processes through fuel switching. That is by using low carbon intensity hydrogen as fuel in their refineries, crackers or furnaces. The second opportunity is our ability to capture and sequester existing carbon emissions from customers currently connected to our pipeline network, especially in the Gulf Coast.\nThis will be a revenue model similar to our current on-site business and customers would benefit by decarbonizing their own operations in addition to monetizing tax credits over the contract period. Together, our potential investment in this category could easily exceed $10 billion, which I view to be on an accelerated path given the incremental IRA benefits and the strength of Linde's existing network and asset base to support it.\nThe third category of new markets represents greenfield opportunities that are starting to materialize with the signing of the IRA, and I expect to announce some new project wins very soon. These, too, will be similar to our current on-site business, with fixed payment contracts and stable returns. We estimate more than $20 billion of potential investment, with some of the larger ones related to blue and green hydrogen and blue ammonia.\nRegardless of which projects are pursued, we plan to follow a few overarching principles. The first, we intend to partner with subsurface experts for all underground operations. We at Linde are not geologists. Second, all projects will follow our investment criteria. In other words, earn a commensurate return for the risk undertaken. Third, we will stick to our core, which is management of industrial gases. We have no interest to own or speculate on globally traded chemicals. Rather, we have offtakers for our products.\nFinally, it's important to understand the nature of the tax credits in the IRA. While the first 5 years are direct pay, essentially like grants, year 6 through 12 are tax credits that must be used against our U.S. tax liability up to a cap. Therefore, it's important for us to have an understanding on the monetization of these tax credits as we develop these projects, whether used by Linde or sold to a third-party. Of course, we won't speculate on the market value of excess tax credits over the next decade.\nThe IRA has accelerated the U.S. clean energy transition. And from what we are seeing today, the total investment opportunity for Linde in the U.S. alone exceeds $30 billion over the next decade.\nOverall, I'm very bullish on the clean energy opportunities in front of us, and I expect to announce meaningful projects in the near term. This secular growth driver, coupled with our operating discipline and relentless focus on pricing and productivity within our base business, is what gives me the confidence in our ability to keep delivering 10-plus percent EPS growth over the next several years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.\n\nMatthew J. White\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the third quarter results.\nSales of $8.8 billion grew 15% over last year and 4% sequentially. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of higher energy costs, reached 8% year-over-year as energy prices continue to escalate. As a reminder, this is merely a contractual gross-up and has no effect on operating profit dollars but will dilute operating margins. This is mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation of 7% as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against every major currency.\nDivestiture headwind of 1% is from the Russian deconsolidation. And the 4% growth in Engineering relates to favorable timing of project billing.\nExcluding these items, underlying sales increased 11% over 2021. Volume expanded 3% as 1/3 came from the project backlog and the remainder from increases in Americas and APAC, partially offset by slightly lower volumes in EMEA.\nPricing of 8% continues to be strong as all regions around the world are taking proactive and sustainable actions to recover inflation.\nUnderlying sequential growth of 3% is driven by similar factors as broad-based price improvements and volume growth in Americas and APAC more than offset weaker volumes in EMEA from a combination of macroeconomic conditions and normal seasonal factors.\nOperating profit of $2 billion resulted in a 22.8% margin, which is 90 basis points above last year when excluding the effects of cost pass-through. Sequentially, operating margins ex pass-through declined 20 basis points from both weaker volumes and a lag effect of merchant and package pricing in EMEA. We still expect consolidated operating margin ex pass-through to expand more than 100 basis points for the full year.\nEPS of $3.10 increased 14% over prior year or 21% when excluding currency. This represents the eighth quarter in a row of EPS ex FX growth exceeding 20%, demonstrating the breadth of Linde's portfolio.\nReturn on capital of 21.8% reached another record from double-digit percent profit growth over a stable capital base. Our unrivaled asset network across all 3 supply modes enables industry-leading growth without significant capital intensity, although we have ample capacity for greater investments, of which we expect to announce large wins in the near future.\nThe ROC trend is also a result of disciplined capital and cash management. Sanjiv mentioned how we intend to approach clean energy investments no different than other opportunities, which is an integral part of our multi-decade successful track record. Our owners expect stable, long-term returns commensurate with risk, making ROC one of the most important metrics in our industry.\nSlide 6 provides more details on the third quarter capital management. Cash flow continues to be a key indicator of company stability and longevity, especially against the current backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and rising interest rates.\nYou can see operating cash flow trends, with Q3 being the highest of 2022, up 24% sequentially and 3% from last year. In addition, available cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx, remains steady at $1.5 billion to $2 billion per quarter. Recall that base CapEx represents all nonproject investments, of which approximately half are dedicated to growth initiatives.\nThe right part of the slide shows how we deployed year-to-date cash flow. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is simple and stable. We have a mandate to maintain an A credit rating while growing the dividend each year. Our priority is to invest in core business opportunities that meet our criteria and any leftover cash is used for stock repurchases.\nCurrently, our metrics are better than a single A credit rating, and thus we are actively recapitalizing the balance sheet. Year-to-date investments have totaled $2.4 billion between CapEx and acquisitions, of which I anticipate an acceleration based on the current set of opportunities.\nFinally, we've returned $6.3 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases, an increase of 31% from last year.\nThis slide clearly demonstrates that irrespective of the macro climate, Linde will continue to drive steady, long-term quality growth while sharing a substantial portion with our owners each year.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, EPS is anticipated to be $2.80 to $2.90 or 9% to 13% growth excluding an estimated 8% currency headwind. This represents a $0.25 or 8% sequential decline from Q3 to the midpoint.\nThere are 3 major assumptions driving this. First, 4% the decline is driven by Engineering project timing. Engineering results are naturally lumpy due to project progress and we had a sizable Americas project billing in Q3. And while the Engineering business has been streamlining the organization and rebuilding the backlog to maintain strong competitiveness and quality results, I still expect Q4 to have lower sales and profit from this timing.\nSecond, we anticipate currency rates to worsen, driving down sequential EPS by another 2%. Rates seemed to stabilize in October, but we'll have to wait until January to see where they ultimately finish.\nFinally, we completed the divestiture of the noncore GIST business at the end of September. This had a minor effect at 1%, but we provided more details in the appendix so you can better model the future impact.\nNote, we are also assuming no base growth at the top end of Q4 guidance and, thus, recessionary conditions at the midpoint. Consistent with prior quarters, this economic assumption is merely a placeholder. So if conditions are better, we'll do better. And if they're worse, we'll take actions to mitigate.\nThe full year guidance of $11.93 to $12.03 represents 17% to 18% growth from last year when excluding currency. The midpoint of the range is $0.15 higher than last quarter, driven by better Q3 results.\nOverall, the Linde team continues to execute despite the global challenges. We've demonstrated resilient high-quality performance through recessionary conditions and 2023 will be no exception. So regardless of what you read in the news, you can count Linde to deliver.\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Linde plc Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations for any [additional or closing] remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nVP of IR, Linde Plc\n\nThank you, Elaine. Good day, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2022 second quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation.\nSanjiv will provide the opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's second quarter financial performance and outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO & Director, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by addressing the $1 billion charge this quarter, primarily related to deconsolidating our Russian subsidiaries. Impairing assets is not something we take likely. However, the current situation in Russia is unprecedented with the extraordinary sanctions and capital restrictions. And while deconsolidation means we will not report Russian results going forward, we are actively working to safely and economically scale back operations. We fully intend to recover value for these assets, including potential divestitures, but it will take some time.\nDespite this noncash accounting charge, the global business continues to be resilient and performed quite well in the second quarter with strong pricing, solid cash flows and margins expanding sequentially and year-on-year, excluding cost pass-through.\nSlide 3 demonstrates the defensive nature of our model. Now it may look familiar since many of these elements were presented in the second quarter of 2020. The world may change, but our business model does not. We've been around for well over 100 years and through that demonstrated our resiliency during some of the most difficult periods in modern history. Approximately 2/3 of the business is protected through contractual fixed payments, such as facility fees and rent; and sales to resilient end markets like food and beverage, health care and electronics.\nThis portfolio provides tremendous downside protection during typical times like the early 2000 recession, the great financial crisis, the 2020 pandemic and, of course, now in 2022. In addition, strong cash generation coupled with relentless price and cost management support the business when volumes contract. And of course, we can benefit from a recovery as demonstrated after each recession.\nThese facts apply to all geographic segments, including EMEA, where there appears to be some potential investor misconceptions around our business. So you can see on the bottom right our exposure to EMEA and some additional color, specifically to Germany. We run our business in Europe like anywhere else in the world, safely, reliably and in a manner to contractually limit our financial exposure to customer volatility. Now I'm not going to speculate what will happen in Europe regarding the energy situation. But I have confidence in our business model and contracts that we can weather challenges, and we will capitalize on opportunities that may lie ahead.\nNow before I hand it off to Matt, I'd like to provide some color on end markets by segment. Slide 4 shows our organic growth is still quite positive across all end markets with the exception of health care, which is due to lapping COVID-related oxygen volumes in developing nations. Overall growth is driven by pricing action, project backlog even as base volumes are relatively stable, although underlying trends by geographic segments vary a little.\nLet me start off with the EMEA region since it seems to be getting most press recently. Volumes were down 1% from last year and flat sequentially, while price increased 12% and 3%, respectively. The team has done a great job pricing inflation while keeping a tight lid on costs, and I fully expect this to continue. On-site volumes have been quite stable from a combination of highly competitive top-tier customer base and strong contracts. Merchant and packaged are slightly down as a reduction in COVID oxygen and lower manufacturing volumes more than offset growth in food and beverage, metals and mining and electronics.\nSo far in July, we haven't seen any material change from June trends despite certain countries navigating their energy challenges. You will recall, in the second quarter of 2020, eurozone industrial production levels dropped roughly 20% due to COVID lockdowns. At that time, our EMEA segment organically declined only 7%. And since that time, the EMEA segment operating profit has grown approximately 80%. In other words, the EMEA business has successfully navigated unprecedented economic shocks in the past, and I see no reason why that won't continue going forward.\nThe APAC segment had another solid quarter despite COVID lockdowns in China. Volumes increased 3% from prior year and 5% sequentially, while prices improved 5% and 1%. On-site customers across all end markets continue to run steady, including China. We saw similar trends in past recessions, which speaks to the quality of our customer base. Now China merchant was weaker from the production curtailment of small- to medium-sized customers, which was partially offset by merchant growth in other countries as well as higher packaged gas volumes, especially our specialty gases used in electronics such as helium, neon and xenon.\nIn July, China merchant volumes have recovered to levels more consistent with normal run rate as we've been seeing -- we haven't been seeing material COVID impact at this time. I do expect some volume ups and downs in the second half, but that should smooth out by the end year. Aside from China, organic growth across Korea, South Pacific, South and Southeast Asia remain healthy from a combination of project start-ups, pricing actions, and of course, our capability to supply gases across all 3 supply modes.\nOur largest segment, the Americas has some of the best growth trends and opportunities for the near term. Organic growth of 9% from the last year includes 3% volume and 6% price. All major end markets have expanded, led by food and beverage, electronics, manufacturing, chemicals and energy, excluding Latin American health care trends related to COVID.\nIn the U.S., our integrated model across all 3 supply modes enables reliable and seamless gas supply for all customers regardless of size or end market. In fact, our U.S. packaged gas business has been one of our fastest-growing businesses with underlying sales up 16% from prior year led by aerospace, construction, electronics and met fab. The underlying trend appears stable in July, although we expect some normal seasonal slowing for the summer holidays.\nAlso, we continue to see more project backlog opportunities in the U.S. than anywhere else. Recent wins for electronics have been the largest driver, but progress on potential new U.S. Gulf Coast projects, especially for blue hydrogen are encouraging. And as I look at our overall current sale of gas backlog report, there are several projects we expect to sign before the year-end, which could take this number close to the $4 billion mark, even after starting up close to $1 billion in projects during the course of the year.\nNow I'd also like to highlight that we recently issued our annual sustainability report, which provides a comprehensive view of our SDG-based initiatives and tracks our progress. I'm pleased to see that in this quarter we reported a reduction of 31% on our GHG emissions versus the 2018 baseline, well ahead of our projections to reach our target of 35% reduction by 2028.\nBut we realized that an intensity goal was not enough. And therefore, last year, we communicated our ambitious 35 by 35 goal. As you know, we're committed in reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions 35% by the year 2035, on the way to becoming climate-neutral by 2050. As you'd expect, our 35 by 35 target is science-based and aligned with the Paris accord goal.\nOverall, our technical capability, unrivaled network density, disciplined operating culture and a committed team allows us to quickly capitalize on any growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria. Now some investors mistakenly look at 1 or 2 countries in our portfolio and come to conclusions about growth prospects of profitability. But what they miss is our ability to capture that growth anywhere in the world while simultaneously rightsizing the businesses in an efficient manner. This ability has enabled us to consistently deliver double-digit EPS growth, and this year is no different. The Linde model is well suited for a fast-changing world, and our performance will continue to demonstrate its resilience.\nI'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through the financial numbers.\n\nMatthew J. White\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to explain the Russian deconsolidation in a little more detail. Over $900 million of the charge relates to net Russian asset impairments. Note these assets have increased almost 25% in the last few months due to the strengthening of the Russian ruble.\nThere were several factors that led to this outcome, including the unprecedented sanctions and severe capital restrictions. Deconsolidation essentially means we cease reporting any business activity on our financial statements. However, we still own these assets, and we'll continue to scale back operations while working to divest some industrial assets. We will only recognize cash that can be repatriated from Russia into a consolidated Linde entity. And as Sanjiv stated, we are laser-focused to continuously extract economic value consistent with every other business we own.\nPlease turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the second quarter results. Sales of $8.5 billion increased 12% from prior year and 3% sequentially. Versus prior year, contractual cost pass-through increased 7%, primarily from the on-site business, but this was partially offset by a currency translation decline of 5%. Foreign currency is anticipated to remain a significant headwind, which I'll speak to later on the guidance slide.\nOrganic sales increased 9% from last year and 4% sequentially. Gas volumes increased 2%, primarily from project start-ups. Base volumes were relatively flat as increases in manufacturing, food and beverage, and electronics were mostly offset by lower health care volumes from COVID. Pricing of 7% was broad-based and once again demonstrated our ability to price in extraordinary inflation environments. Recall, this figure primarily represents merchant and packaged, so underlying price increases are higher.\nOperating profit of $2 billion resulted in a 23.5% margin. Excluding the effects of contractual cost pass-through, operating margins expanded 100 basis points from prior year and 80 basis points over the first quarter. This represents the second quarter in a row that operating margins have sequentially improved, which confirms the 1- to 2-quarter recovery lag we discussed late last year.\nYou can see the table showing operating margin trend by segment, excluding the effects of cost pass-through. It's important to highlight that Americas segment margin declined more than 100 basis points from onetime charges incurred during the second quarter, which are classified as other expenses. This will not repeat, so I fully expect Americas margins to return to the normal run rate in the third quarter.\nSeparately, APAC and EMEA continued to show solid margin expansion versus all periods as price and cost management continue to improve business quality. You'll see in the appendix how Global Other segment had positive operating income. As mentioned last quarter, Q1 had onetime charges which we [lapped], and now you're seeing the benefit of lower corporate cost, coupled with higher volumes to the aerospace market in the coatings business. Note we are in the process of divesting the noncore GIST business, which will result in lower sales and operating profit for this segment going forward.\nEPS of $3.10 increased 15% from last year or 20% excluding FX. Despite the various geopolitical headwinds, the business continues to generate EPS well in excess of our midterm commitment. Return on capital reached 20%, almost doubling from the 2018 merger baseline level. This was accomplished from double-digit earnings growth, strong cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, all during a highly volatile economic environment.\nSlide 6 provides more details on our capital management. Available operating cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx that is used for maintenance or noncontractually committed growth, has held steady during 2022 at $1.5 billion per quarter. During the second quarter alone, we deployed $3 billion of capital with approximately 1 quarter invested into the business and the remainder distributed back to shareholders as dividends and repurchases. This approach is only possible with steady and reliable cash flow, a highly valuable trait to have these days.\nI'll wrap up with an updated outlook on Slide 7. Third quarter guidance range of $2.85 to $2.95 represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 8% or 10% to 14% when excluding an estimated 6% FX headwind. The FX assumption was based on spot rates from a few weeks ago, so it reflects some of the recent devaluations. This sequential EPS decline of $0.15 from Q2 to the top end of the Q3 range is driven by $0.10 of FX and $0.05 from the deconsolidation of Russia. Therefore, this range assumes no base growth at the top end with recessionary conditions below that.\nConsistent with prior guidance, this is not our prediction of the economy but rather an assumption used in the figures. You can insert your own view of the economy. If it does better, we'll be above this range. And if it does worse, we'll take mitigating actions.\nFull year EPS guidance range of $11.73 to $11.93 is 10% to 12% above prior year or 15% to 17% when excluding the negative 5% currency impact. This range was increased from last quarter since improved business performance more than offset the larger FX translation headwind. Irrespective of the geopolitical landscape, we will relentlessly take actions to improve the business and outperform expectations.\nAs Sanjiv stated, we've been doing this for over a century. Consistent with prior crises, I fully expect to not only overcome these challenges but emerge even stronger than before. And while the financial markets may temporarily underprice our stock from misperceptions of the business model, we'll continue to pursue quality growth while deploying excess cash towards stock repurchases, all in an effort to reward long-term shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Linde Plc First Quarter 2020 Earnings Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now hand the call over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nVP of IR, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sergey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2022 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation.\nSanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's first quarter financial performance and outlook. After which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCEO & Director, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by addressing the recent global events and the tragedy occurring in Ukraine. A senseless invasion has caused widespread casualties and destruction at a level not seen in Europe for generations. As a global company, integrated within countless communities across the globe, Linde must do its part to help.\nI'm happy to report that all of our 121 Ukrainian employees are safe. And I'm incredibly proud of the courage and determination they've demonstrated throughout the crisis, including several who've chosen to continue producing and delivering life-saving medical gases. We are supporting their needs directly and indirectly, including through contributions of approximately $2 million. I can only pray that all the global pressure and support is enough to bring this war to an end and allow the efforts to begin towards healing and rebuilding Ukraine.\nGiven these circumstances, we are scaling back gas operations in Russia. We have already ceased supply to certain customers and initiated the divestment process for some industrial assets. All in, an effort to reduce our footprint, which is already quite small at approximately 1% of sales. Furthermore, we have stopped new investments and business development while winding down several engineering projects. Given this, we have removed second half Russian earnings contribution from the guidance. Matt will speak more on this. However, we are scaling back responsibly as we continue to support our employees and their efforts to supply critical gases for medical and safety needs.\nNow in the light of uncertain economic climate, I thought it would be helpful to highlight trends we're seeing by end markets and geographies. Let me now go on to Slide 3, which gives you a summary of Q1 growth rates by key end markets. Two overarching points are that the organic growth of 9% from a strong 2021 foundation and broad-based increases across both consumer and industrial-related end markets. At 17% of sales, healthcare trends are roughly flat as greater medical procedures in the developed markets were offset by lower hospital oxygen in developing markets such as Latin America and Eastern Europe.\nNow fortunately, it appears COVID oxygen needs are abating. So I expect health care to return to its long-term growth rate of mid-single-digit percentage as we continue to expand patient offerings for both hospital and home. Food and Beverage continues robust year-on-year growth as most parts of the world have returned to restaurant dining as well as increased applications for bulk food and beverage production. This resilient market should grow low to mid-single-digit percent. Note that the sequential trends are down due to normal seasonality from fourth quarter holiday season.\nElectronics at 9% of sales remains one of our fastest-growing end markets, especially in Americas and APAC. The primary gas is sold to these customers are ultra-high purity nitrogen, hydrogen, helium and rare gases. That includes neon, which represents less than 1% of total sales. However, given the amount of attention this molecule has recently received, it's fair to say that we're well positioned as one of the largest producers of neon in the world, with the vast majority of it being refined at our own sites in the U.S. and Germany. We are, of course, working closely with our customers to address their increased demand.\nThe electronics market grew 13% versus last year with a mix of underlying growth and project start-ups, and I fully expect to announce more new project wins during the course of this year.\nTurning to industrial end markets. Chemicals and Energy at 24% of sales grew double digit, led by the Americas, which drove more than half of that increase. We are seeing very strong demand across all phases of energy development as U.S. refining rates are close to record levels, driving even more demand for hydrogen and other gases. In addition, merchant hydrogen volumes rose by almost 60% from the last year in support of clean energy initiatives. Our chemical customers in the U.S. are some of the lowest cost producers in the world and thus saw high demand for their end products, requiring significant on-site gas supply. The current combination of high energy prices and transition to clean energy should drive continued growth in this end market for years to come.\nTo this point, we are currently reviewing close to 300 clean energy projects, with the probability weighted spend exceeding $5 billion for these clean energy projects. So I feel quite good about our prospects for future growth in this space.\nMetals & Mining at 14% of sales grew 7% from last year and 5% sequentially as lower volumes in China were more than offset by other regions, increasing their production to meet global demand. Americas improved sequentially and from prior year as U.S.-based steel mills increased production in support of higher industrial activity. In APAC, lower Chinese steel volumes were mostly offset by higher production from other countries. As the world races to replace Russian-based mining metals and energy sources, I expect to see our customers continue to increase their production and investment levels.\nFinally, the manufacturing end market grew 11% from the last year and 4% sequentially, versus prior year growth was broad-based in every segment, but led by the Americas from increased aerospace and general manufacturing. Now last week, we announced another new long-term agreement with a major space launch company to provide rocket propulsion gases out of our recently expanded Florida plant. Currently, rocket and satellite propulsion demand is at its highest level we've ever seen, going as far back as the NASA's Apollo program. Linde is proud to be leading industrial gas supplier to all key players in the U.S.-based program.\nLooking ahead, there are clearly concerns around energy security, especially in Europe, which could result in persistent inflation. Additionally, shortages of Russian source commodities, coupled with Chinese production curtailments from COVID could put additional pressure on global production levels. Regardless of what ultimately happens in the economy, Linde has demonstrated time and time again that we weather the storm better than most. We have a committed team, a high-performance culture and an integrated network across all three supply modes, that's why I'm confident Linde will continue being the best performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to walk through the financial numbers.\n\nMatthew J. White\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the first quarter results. Sales of $8.2 billion increased 13% from prior year but declined 1% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Versus prior year, cost pass-through increased 6% from a contractual billing of higher energy costs, but currency translation reduced sales by 3% from a stronger U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and pound sterling. Excluding these items, organic sales grew 9% from 3% more volume split between project backlog and base and 6% more pricing as we continue to price to inflation. Recall that actual price increases are much higher for the combined packaged and merchant gases.\nSequentially, when excluding the 1% currency headwind, organic sales increased 2% as 3% higher pricing was partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. The volume decline was driven by lower EMEA medical oxygen and seasonal effects from food and beverage, Chinese New Year and Southern Hemisphere LPG. Engineering volumes are up 1% from prior year, but down 2% sequentially as we have begun winding down several Russian projects, and we expect that trend to continue into Q2.\nOperating profit of $1.9 billion increased 13% from 2021 and 3% sequentially. The operating margin of 23.2% is roughly flat with prior year, but up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter. The contractual cost pass-through has no effect on operating profit dollars, but will impact operating margins as we adjust both sales and cost with energy prices. Excluding this effect, operating margins are up 130 basis points from prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. You can see the table to the right, showing underlying margins by geographic segment, with almost all up triple digits across both periods.\nDespite the unprecedented geopolitical events and subsequent inflationary pressure, the business quality continues to improve, and we anticipate that margins ex cost pass-through should increase going forward. You may have noticed the higher than normal engineering segment margins at 19.6% and lower-than-normal global other operating profit at a $44 million loss. These are driven by project timing differences and one-off costs, which both should return to normal run rate levels by the second quarter. EPS of $2.93 increased 18% from last year and 6% sequentially, as we continue to demonstrate strong leverage down the entire income statement.\nDisciplined capital management is supporting lower interest costs and reduced share count, which I'll speak to more on the next slide. The final number I'd like to highlight is return on capital, which represents one of the most important financial metrics in our industry. Three years ago, this figure was 10.4%. Today, we're at 18.9% and still growing. This progress doesn't happen overnight. It requires a sustained high performance culture across all levels of the business. We're quite confident that Linde is and will continue to be a long-term value compounder with a healthy blend of high-quality growth, tremendous resilience and significant shareholder returns.\nSlide 5 provides more color on our capital management trends. Q1 operating cash flow of $2 billion was slightly below last year, due to unfavorable working capital timing in January and February. While March was a much stronger month, it wasn't enough to catch up. I expect improvements in Q2 as our DSO and DPO levels are still quite stable. Also recall that Q1 tends to be one of the weakest quarters of the year due to cash payment timing.\nEngineering cash flow was positive in Q1, but down year-over-year on project payment timing. In light of the accelerated Russian project wind downs, I expect more payment outflows to vendors as we close out several projects, consistent with how all projects are closed out, but at a significantly faster pace. Overall, I still anticipate a full year operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio in the low to mid-80% range.\nAs far as how we deploy that cash, we announced a 10% dividend increase for 2022, which marks the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. We also announced a new $10 billion share repurchase program on February 28, of which we've already spent $1.7 billion by the end of April. And of course, we will always reinvest in the business, which is our priority for capital. Despite the economic challenges, we still have access to low-cost capital as evidenced by our most recent bond deal. We issued over EUR 2 billion across 3 tranches. And as you can see, the attractive pricing, we had a weighted average maturity of 10 years with a weighted average coupon of 1.4%. Irrespective of the economic climate, we will maintain a steady and predictable capital allocation policy to invest in the business while rewarding shareholders.\nI'll finish up on Slide 6, which provides the updated earnings outlook. Second quarter guidance range of $2.90 to $3, represents 7% to 11% growth over prior year or 10% to 14% when excluding currency translation impact. For the full year, the new guidance range is $11.65 to $11.90, a 9% to 11% growth rate from 2021 or 11% to 13% when adjusting for currency. Both estimates have two key underlying assumptions.\nFirst, there is no assumed base economic growth at the midpoint. Consistent with last quarter, this is not our economic projection but rather a placeholder for the guidance. You can insert your own view of the economy. If it does better, we will do better. And if it does worse, we'll take actions to mitigate. Second, we have removed contribution of Russian earnings by the second half of the year. As we continue to wind down engineering projects, cease certain operations and sell industrial assets, we felt it was appropriate to remove Russian earnings from the outlook and associated projects from the backlog. These actions are ongoing. So we anticipate some residual earnings in Q2, which are projected to cease by Q3.\nWhile this is a fluid situation with many complexities, we are committed to following all sanctions and scaling down operations in a safe manner. Overall, despite economic uncertainties, we are raising the full year outlook. In fact, as Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has demonstrated industry-leading performance year after year. We only need to look at the last 3 years to prove that. At the start of 2019, when some investors doubted the merits of the merger, we quickly came together as one and grew EPS 19%, finishing the year at an all-time high stock price.\nMoving into 2020, when the pandemic struck Linde stock was sold off from apparent concerns of too much cyclicality without enough resiliency only to ultimately achieve 12% EPS growth and finished the year at a new all-time high stock price. And when 2021 began, Linde stock was once again sold off. This time, from apparent concerns of too much resiliency without enough cyclicality. And yet, we grew EPS by 30%, and once again, finished the year at another new all-time high stock price. Now in 2022, Linde stock has been sold off again from concerns of economic uncertainty and high inflation. Time will tell how we ultimately finish this year -- but personally, I like our odds. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.",

Welcome to the Linde plc Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJuan Pelaez\n\nVP of IR, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Cristina.

Let me turn the call over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjiv Lamba\n\nCOO, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. By all measures, 2021 was another successful year for Linde. Our employees around the world delivered strong financial results while exemplifying Linde's core values every day. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for their tireless efforts to ensure safe, reliable and cost-effective supply of critical products and services to our customers.\nSlide 3 provides full year highlights by 4 key areas of focus. Of course, this list is not exhaustive. There are many more we manage every day. However, these represent the overarching priorities that I view is important to our continuing success. So let me begin with our shareholders. This year, we once again delivered industry-leading performance. That makes it the third year in a row since our merger. EPS grew 30%. Operating cash flows expanded 31% and ROCE increased to 17.7%, with all three metrics reaching record levels. And it's important to remember, we achieved these numbers from a very strong 2020 base, which also grew double-digit percent from 2019. We clearly demonstrated the resilience of our business in 2020 and the ability to leverage the economic recovery in 2021.\nWe shared the success with our owners by distributing $7 billion in the form of dividends and stock repurchases, and I fully expect this trend to continue. This was all done while implementing an orderly CEO and Board share transition to ensure future performance without any disruption. In fact, we have positioned ourselves quite well for the future. by winning high-quality opportunities that meet our disciplined investment criteria. 2021 ended with a record $13 billion of contractually secured backlog projects, including more than $1 billion for new semiconductor fabs with leading customers in the electronics end market.\nIn addition to that, we made $2 billion of base CapEx investments, including a record 43 small on-site plants also with long-term contracts. And we have also committed close to $500 million in clean energy initiatives. Currently, we are reviewing roughly 300 decarbonization projects globally with probability adjusted add to more than $4 billion of potential investment opportunities. Of course, none of this is possible without the thousands of talented employees that run our businesses each day. We achieved best-in-class safety performance while improving gender diversity to 28%, well on track for our (inaudible) goal.\nIn addition, we improved on several other country-specific diversity goals to ensure we run and manage our businesses in a way that best reflects and supports the communities we live in. We are a very local business, and it's critical that we always strive to give back. In further support of that commitment, every lender business contributed to the 400 community engagement projects executed around the wall. And all these actions were undertaken in another year of the pandemic, with teams providing reliable and uninterrupted supply of gases and services to our customers, including critical oxygen to millions of patients in hospitals and at their homes.\nFinally, we maintained a strong commitment towards sustainability, by doubling down on our existing carbon intensity goals and announcing more ambitious, absolute emission reduction goals for 2035 and also a road map for climate neutrality by 2050. And while it's happening to see independent recognition of our employees' efforts in this area, including a few listed here from Dow Jones Sustainability and CDP. I know we can further improve.\nOverall, I'm proud of how the Linde team came together against several headwinds and delivered industry-leading performance once again. So as I sit here today, I'm more confident now than ever on our ability to deliver another record year in 2022. I'll now hand over the call to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers. Matt?\n\nMatthew J. White\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Linde Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjeev. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the fourth quarter results. Sales of $8.3 billion were up 14% versus prior year and 8% sequentially. You can see the effects of cost pass-through at 6% and 3% versus last year and the third quarter. While this is the highest quarterly number we've seen in over a (inaudible), it demonstrates the strength of our contracts by protecting returns from higher energy costs. And remember, this has no impact to operating profit dollars, but will negatively affect operating margins since we gross up both sales and costs. As anticipated, engineering contributed a solid 3% growth on the strength of their record project backlog. This trend should continue in the foreseeable future as they work through their multiyear $10 billion sale of plant backlog. Excluding these items, organic sales increased 9% over last year and 2% sequentially from a combination of higher volume and price. The volume increase over 2020 was broad-based with 1/3 coming from project start-ups and the remainder from base volume improvement across all end markets. Sequentially, volumes were flat as growth in Food and Beverage and Energy and Chemicals were offset by lower metals and seasonal reductions in our Southern Hemisphere LPG business. Price increased 3% over prior year and 2% sequentially across all geographic segments, with the largest increase coming from EMEA due to greater inflationary pressures.\nWe continue to experience some pricing lag for the merchant and packaged business. So we fully expect strong pricing in Q1 and throughout 2022 to recover inflation. Note, actual merchant and packaged price increases are mid-single to low double-digit percent across all segments.\nOperating profit of $1.8 billion is up 14% from last year and 2% sequentially. Operating margins of 22.2% are flat with prior year, but down 140 basis points sequentially. There are three drivers currently having a negative effect on operating margins, of which two have a neutral to positive effect on operating profit dollars and the third is a temporary lag that will correct over the next few quarters. The first factor is, of course, cost pass-through. And as mentioned earlier, a 6% increase is the highest we've seen. This is a standard part of our contracts that has no effect on profit dollars, but had an unfavorable impact to operating margins of 120 and 70 basis points versus prior year and third quarter, respectively.\nThe second factor relates to the Engineering segment becoming a larger part of the growth. This will improve profit dollars and cash growth, but has a negative effect on mix since this business has a different margin profile due to the lack of capital intensity. Finally, the last factor is because energy prices have increased faster than price actions in the merchant and packaged business. This pricing normally lags 1 to 2 quarters and the higher inflation in Q4 caused this to push out another quarter. You can see in the table what the gas segment margin trends look like, excluding cost pass-through impact, up quite nicely year-over-year and down slightly on a sequential basis from this lag effect. I fully expect we'll recover this inflation with underlying margins expanding in 2022.\nEPS of $2.77 in was 20% above last year and 1% above the third quarter. We also included a full year summary on Appendix Slide 8, showing sales and EPS growth of 13% and 30%. To Sanjay's point, this growth rate comes off a 2020 base, which also performed quite well. Full year and Q4 2021 EPS increased from 2019 by 46% and 47%, respectively, which emphasizes the continued growth of our business through any scenario. In fact, the business is well positioned to outperform in all economic cycles.\nOur portfolio has ample resilient market exposure for recessions like 2020. High-quality cyclical customers across all supply modes for expansion periods, like 2021, significant sale of plant capabilities to immediately benefit from capital cycles like we're seeing today and sale of gas expertise, which has delayed capital cycle benefits, 2 to 3 years down the road. Simply stated, the Linde model can deliver leading performance regardless of the macroeconomic climate.\nThe last point I'd like to make on this slide relates to capital management. You can see that ROC, which we view as the single most important metric for this industry, reached a new record of 17.7%. This doesn't just happen overnight. It takes considerable effort from thousands of our employees to continuously deliver industry-leading profit and cash growth underpinned by a disciplined and consistent capital allocation process. And a big part of that effort went toward delivering the record operating cash flow of $3.2 billion, which is covered in more detail on Slide 5.\nThe left side shows our quarterly operating cash flow trend. You can see that cash has increased each quarter for 3 straight years, and that 2021 was a record by growing 31% over prior year. The operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio reached 96% for full year 2021, well above historical levels. Part of this is driven by project prepayments in the $1.3 billion inflow of contract assets and liabilities, which is the accounting term to describe working capital for the engineering business. As stated before, engineering is a strong cash-generating business that delivers returns well within our investment criteria. These prepayments are from the record project backlog, which will benefit the income statement over the next 3 to 4 years. Due to timing effects, I expect 2022 contract assets and liabilities to be substantially lower than the 2021 level, but we still anticipate strong cash performance across the rest of the business units. Overall, I expect ongoing operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios in the low to mid-80% range.\nThe right side shows how we deploy the $10 billion of full year cash flow. 1/3 was invested back into the business in the form of contractually secured growth projects and base CapEx, which represents both growth and maintenance investments. While a substantial portion of our business including packaged gases, health care services and engineering don't require much CapEx to grow, so this only represents a portion of the future growth potential. In addition, we returned 2/3 or $7 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our January 2021 share repurchase program of $5 billion is substantially complete, and we will review the future capital allocation in our upcoming Board meeting in 2 weeks. Overall, strong cash contribution from all business units enabled Linde to invest for future growth, while rewarding shareholders.\nI'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. First quarter guidance is in the range of $2.70 to $2.80, up 8% to 12% from prior year or 11% to 15% when adjusting for the assumed 3% currency headwind. Sequentially versus Q4, this range assumes flat economic conditions with seasonally lower volumes, offset by higher inflation recovery. Q1 is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year, including for cash flow due to payment timing. Full year 2022 guidance is $11.55 to $11.85, representing an 8% to 11% increase versus 2021 and or 10% to 13% when adjusting for the 2% FX headwind. The midpoint of this range assumes flat economic conditions and thus, no base volume improvement. Consistent with our prior approach, this is not our economic forecast, rather, it merely represents the underlying assumption in the guidance range. You can insert your own view of the 2022 economy. And if it does better, I'd expect to be at the top end or above this range. And if we experience a recession, we'll take actions to meet this commitment as we did in 2020.\nThere remains a lot of uncertainty heading into 2022. And despite all the expert forecasts, nobody knows what will happen. However, we have an industry-leading business portfolio and contractually secured project backlog. So regardless of the economic challenges, we remain quite confident in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.",

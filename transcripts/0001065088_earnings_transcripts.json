We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report we delivered better-than-expected results across our key financial metrics in Q3. Our gross merchandise volume grew 8% to $20.1 billion. Revenue increased by over 8% to $2.82 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 14% year-over-year to $1.36. We achieved these strong top and bottom line results amid continued macroeconomic challenges across our international markets and increased headwinds for cross-border trade into the U.S.\nNow let's go deeper into the key drivers behind our strong Q3 performance. Focused category GMV growth accelerated to over 15% in Q3, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 11 percentage points. This growth was broad-based as all of our focus categories grew positively year-over-year with most accelerating sequentially. Although we expect the level of growth in focused categories to normalize in the near future, our momentum speaks to the level of innovation we've driven for customers and the increased likelihood that enthusiasts consider eBay when shopping in these categories.\nWithin our focus categories, collectibles was the largest contributor to growth. driven by another quarter of accelerating year-over-year GMV growth in both collectible card games and sports trading cards. Our off-platform marketplaces, TCGPlayer and Goldin also saw GMV accelerate sequentially. Pokemon GMV grew in the triple digits year-over-year for the third straight quarter, benefiting from a strong product release cadence. We believe our continued momentum in trading cards is a direct result of the trust and innovation we've driven for hobbyists in recent years with features like my collection, AI-powered listing tools, authentication and grading, consignment partnerships and integrated PSA population data.\nWe've added new ways to buy and connect with other enthusiasts through eBay Live. We've also benefited from a consistent drumbeat of activations at major tentpole events like New York Comic-Con and the National Card Collectors Convention where we had our biggest presence ever this year. While we do not expect GMV growth in this category to be linear every quarter, particularly as we face more challenging comps starting in Q4, we are confident in a long runway for secular growth in trading cards. Motors, parts and accessories, or P&A was our second largest contributor to GMV growth in Q3, generating more than 1 point for the overall marketplace. The introduction of easy and free returns in the U.S. continued to build upon our trusted value proposition in P&A, while the cost and return rates for this program are well within our forecasted ranges.\nWe continue to expand choice and selection in key inventory segments such as salvage and used parts, which help consumers find value at a time when many are stressed financially. Overall, we have over 750 million live P&A listings, which enables us to offer the largest online selection of unique auto parts and accessories in most of our major markets. Fashion was another notable driver of GMV growth in Q3, led by our Luxury Streetwear and Pre-Loved apparel focused categories. In Q3, we reinforced our commitment to the circular economy through a collaboration with Marks & Spencer, 1 of the U.K.'s most iconic retail brands. U.K. consumers can now drop off used clothing at Marks & Spencer stores and give those items a second life through resale on eBay. The program keeps quality fashion in circulation by repair and cleaning and reselling wearable items and responsibly recycling the rest.\nWe're excited by the potential of this partnership to unlock more Pre-Loved clothing on eBay, extend the lifespan of high-quality products and raise awareness of our growing role in driving the circular economy.\nIn September, we expanded our Authenticity Guarantee Program in the U.K. to cover 70 luxury and premium brands in apparel, shoes and accessories, building upon our existing offerings in sneakers, watches, handbags and fine jewelry. This makes the U.K. our first market where luxury items can be authenticated from head-to-toe, reducing buyer friction and unlocking more high-value transactions across premium brands. eBay Live continues to build momentum with consistent quarter-over-quarter growth across every major key performance indicator we track, including viewers, watch time, sold items and GMV.\nIn recent weeks, eBay Live's annual GMV run rate was up approximately 5x year-over-year. We've created more personalized entry points into eBay Live across our homepage, search and view item pages, making it easier for our scaled buyer base to discover and join live shopping events that speak directly to their passions. In Q3, we hosted some incredible eBay Live shopping events in the U.S. The Backstreet Boys joined Paradise Card breaks at the eBay Open in Las Vegas. We had Milwaukee Bucks Superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo and his brothers joined Ken Golden for a memorable event at the national. Ken also teamed up with Logan Pall for a high-end sports card box break, which drew approximately 20,000 viewers over a multi-hour stream. eBay Live is also getting strong traction in the U.K. following its formal launch in May at Comi-Con London.\nSince then, we've seen a consistent cadence of exciting live shopping events from a Love Island charity auction stream and eBay's Endless Runway event at London Fashion Week, the Pokemon weekend and new channels for toys and memorabilia. In September, SharkNinja also hosted our first refurbished appliance sales event with great success. It's exciting to see how quickly eBay Live is building cultural relevance and meaningful engagement with enthusiasts across the U.K.\nOverall, we're thrilled by the response we're seeing from sellers and buyers on eBay Live and see significant potential for live commerce to become a strategic growth vector for our marketplace. Improvements to our consumer to consumer, or C2C value proposition in key geographies represent another strategic growth factor for our business. 1 year after we launched our U.K. C2C initiative, we continue to see compelling results. In the first half of 2025, we saw U.K. C2C GMV growth remain well above our prelaunch baseline, as we introduced a buyer-facing fee and ramped adoption of our managed shipping program, which streamlines the shipping process, reduces cost and improves trust.\nIn Q3, we introduced additional C2C changes, including faster payouts for long-tenured sellers, greater transparency into all-in pricing when sellers are listing items and negotiating offers and more competitive terms for items priced below GBP 20. As a result, we saw U.K. customer satisfaction improved notably alongside accelerating year-over-year GMV growth during the quarter. We recently added shipping support for bulky and heavy items through DHL, and we exited Q3 with the majority of U.K. C2C transactions utilizing our managed shipping program, which is now mandated for all eligible items.\nEarlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Tise, a leading social marketplace in the Nordics, focused on preload fashion and lifestyle goods. Tise has built a highly engaged Gen Z and Millennial community and a strong track record in social community-led commerce. This acquisition strengthens our leadership in the circular economy increases our presence in the Nordic markets and accelerates our work to make consumer selling more seamless trusted and scalable. I'm excited to welcome the Tise team to eBay, and I look forward to our teams learning from each other as we drive innovation for fashion enthusiasts and accelerate the circular economy.\nOur years of investment in artificial intelligence have enabled us to leverage our scale and 3 decades of commercially relevant data and insights to transform the eBay experience for customers. In recent years, we've utilized generative AI to dramatically improve the selling experience on eBay through progressive iterations of our magical listing technology. In addition to selling, we've been testing a variety of Agentic experiences in search and shopping to learn how buyers and sellers engage with AI at different phases of the customer journey. This includes both on eBay Agentic experiences like our AI shopping agent pilot and third-party agents from companies like Open AI.\nOur AI shopping agent has given buyers a new way to shop across our inventory, with personalized product picks and expert guidance based on their individual shopping preferences. As the pilot has progressed, we've significantly improved the underlying technology powering the experience. For example, we were able to build hyper-optimized, large language models in-house that perform specific shopping agent tasks at lower latency and for significantly reduced cost versus commercial models.\nWith these learnings and efficiency improvements, we're now poised to gradually bring Agenetic capabilities into the core of eBay's business through the main search experience over the coming quarters. Our early learnings have also guided the development of our Unified Agentic Commerce platform, which integrates our hybrid cloud infrastructure, large language model ecosystem, our model context protocol server and other Agentic protocols with our proprietary data layer. This platform enables a fully connected experience between eBay agents, and generalized third-party agents from companies like OpenAI, which allows us to serve as the most personalized and relevant products to shoppers in real-time based on our 30 years of listings, pricings, transactions and behavior signals. We believe this platform will enable us to deliver more personalized, seamless and trusted experiences for eBay buyers regardless of where they started their shopping journey.\nWith these capabilities now in place, we are well positioned to continue improving the on eBay experience with Agenetic tools touching more of the end-to-end shopping journey, but also connect to compelling third-party Agentic experiences. I'm also excited to see how easy and seamless it is to shop on eBay using the iPhone camera after our recent integration into Apple's Visual Intelligence feature in iOS 26. Now when a user takes a photo or a screenshot of a product they like to shop for online, they can quickly surface relevant listings on eBay, helping more iOS users discover our breadth and depth of unique inventory through an intuitive experience. iPhone users can also take advantage of a great new feature for auctions after we launched live activities functionality on iOS in September, which gives bidders real-time updates directly on their phones lock screen during the final 10 minutes of an eBay auction. This engaging feature has seen click-through rates more than 4x higher than our standard push notifications for auction listings, helping ensure buyers never miss a chance to bid on their next great eBay find.\nConnections between buyers and sellers have always been at the heart of eBay's marketplace. And now we're using AI to make those interactions faster and easier to manage. In Q3, we rolled out an AI assistant for member-to-member messaging across the U.S., U.K. and Australia. This tool takes information from the listing details to provide immediate high-quality suggested answers to buyer inquiries, enabling quicker responses. Sellers have told us this feature has been extremely helpful in answering buyer questions promptly giving them more time to list items and grow their businesses on eBay. Within member-to-member messaging, we've also rolled out a fully integrated offers experience directly into the messaging flow for customers in the U.S., Germany and Australia. This means buyers and sellers can now negotiate offers, view their full offer history and execute counter offers without ever leaving the conversation threat, reducing friction and driving improved sales velocity.\nWith each successive quarter, AI is becoming more embedded throughout the eBay experience. As we build on this progress, we believe AI will continue to make eBay simpler, more personal and more connected for every user.\nMoving to advertising. In Q3, first-party advertising revenue on the eBay platform grew nearly 23%, driven by broad-based growth across our ads portfolio. Active Promoted Listings comprised nearly $1.2 billion of more than $2.4 billion total listings on eBay while over 4.4 million sellers adopted at least a single Promoted Listings product during the quarter. Promoted Listings General ads were the largest contributor to the year-over-year ad revenue growth in Q3, followed by PL priority placements, promoted offsite ads and promoted storage units. We continue to leverage our proprietary AI capabilities to enhance advertising performance. For instance, we recently launched a new multimodal embedding model on view item pages to deliver more relevant recommendations to buyers. This model led to a measurable uplift in Promoted Listings revenue by leveraging a listings imagery in addition to its title and other listing details to surface higher-quality recommendations.\nIn Financial Services, we reached a major milestone for our seller capital program in Q3. Since the inception of this program in 2021, more than $1 billion in growth capital has been dispersed to eBay sellers across the U.S., U.K. and Germany through our financing partners, including more than $200 million through the first 3 quarters of 2025. Many sellers have told us this additional working capital has made a significant difference in their ability to invest in inventory, people and technology to grow their businesses on eBay.\nTurning next to our shipping initiatives, which have become a critical strategic imperative in today's increasingly complex environment for cross-border trade. The recent elimination of the de minimis exemption for imports under $800 has created an incremental cost and friction for cross-border trade into the U.S. To help our sellers and buyers navigate these challenges, we meaningfully accelerated our multiyear product road map for shipping solutions. In October, we launched eBay International Shipping in Canada, our third largest quarter for U.S. imports after Greater China and Japan. This rollout brings the best parts of the U.S. program to both business and consumer sellers in Canada, along with additional capabilities like delivery duties paid functionality and automated application of country of origin data.\nIn Q4, we also began enabling business sellers in Germany to access SpeedPAK an end-to-end cross-border shipping solution offered through a joint venture, which is already available to sellers in Greater China and Japan. SpeedPAK automates customs documentation and tariff calculations helping sellers manage new trade requirements with greater efficiency by simplifying compliance and improving delivery time predictability, SpeedPAK strengthens the resilience of cross-border trade on eBay and ensures buyers continue to receive a reliable shopping experience with transparent duties.\nAs we advance our strategic initiatives, we're equally focused on fostering the culture and talent that makes this progress possible. I'm proud that our dedication to building an inclusive workplace environment continues to be recognized externally. eBay has been named 1 of Forbes America's Best Employers for company culture, 1 of Time World's best companies and 1 of Newsweek America's greatest companies for 2025. These acknowledgments reaffirm our efforts to foster a positive, high-performing culture that attracts and retain some of the best talent in the industry.\nIn closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay, underscoring the momentum in our strategy and the resilience of our marketplace. Our focus categories continue to drive significant growth for our overall marketplace, driven by continued innovation, trusted experiences and increased selection for enthusiasts worldwide. Our Agentic Commerce platform opens up entirely new opportunities for eBay by enabling connectivity between on eBay and third-party agents to facilitate personalized conversational shopping experiences that bring eBay's unique inventory and trust to wherever buyers begin their search. AI also continues to make selling on eBay more seamless and efficient from our magical listing technology to our new member-to-member messaging tools that help sellers manage buyer inquiries in real time.\nI'm incredibly excited about our expansion of eBay Live into new European markets, which builds upon the tremendous momentum we're seeing in the U.S. as we bring live, community-driven commerce to more enthusiasts.\nLastly, our investments in global shipping services are not only helping us support sellers in the current environment, but are accelerating our road map to make cross-border trade more frictionless, which can drive more velocity for consumers and small businesses around the world. Together, these investments keep eBay well positioned for continued long-term sustainable growth as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Peggy, who will provide more details on our financial performance and outlook.\nPeggy, over to you.\n\nPeggy M. Alford\n\nExecutive VP of Global Sales, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie. I will begin with the financial highlights of the third quarter. GMV grew 8% to $20.1 billion. Revenue grew over 8% to $2.82 billion. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 9% year-over-year to $764 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 14% year-over-year to $1.36. And and we returned approximately $760 million to shareholders through repurchases and cash dividends.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial and operating metrics for the third quarter. GMV grew 8% to $20.1 billion on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 4 points sequentially. Our growth in Q3 was primarily attributable to our focused categories and overall strength in the U.S. market, partially offset by a relatively more challenging macro environment internationally and changes to U.S. trade policy, including the elimination of de minimis exemption globally in late August. Foreign exchange provided a tailwind of approximately 180 basis points to spot GMV growth.\nFocused categories grew over 15% in Q3 with all focused categories contributing to our total growth from collectibles to P&A, luxury, refurbished, apparel and sneakers. In our U.S. market, GMV growth accelerated to nearly 13%, driven by broad-based strength across categories and by increases in both sold items and average selling price. In addition to overall strength in the U.S. market, our GMV growth continued to benefit from tailwinds like our Klarna partnership and efficiency and lower funnel marketing spend. Because GMV is reported based on the location of the seller, the delta between U.S. and international GMV growth was also influenced by demand shifting toward domestic sellers due to tariffs.\nInternational GMV grew nearly 4% on an FX-neutral basis, with foreign exchange providing a tailwind of 350 basis points to spot growth. Despite facing relatively more challenging macroeconomic conditions outside of the U.S. in Q3, our international GMV growth also improved sequentially. Recent enhancements to our C2C value proposition in the U.K. contributed to an overall acceleration in U.K. volume growth. Our cross-border business was resilient in the third quarter. However, we saw a deceleration in year-over-year volume growth starting in September in key markets importing into the U.S. after the removal of the de minimis exemption.\nShifting to our biometrics. Our trailing 12-month active buyers were over $134 million in Q3, up 1% year-over-year. Enthusiast buyers remained stable at roughly $16 million, while spend per enthusiast buyer grew year-over-year to over $3,200 on a trailing 12-month basis.\nMoving on to our income statement. Revenue grew over 8% to $2.82 billion on an FX-neutral basis in Q3 while foreign exchange was a tailwind of over 120 basis points to spot growth. Our take rate was 14% in Q3 as continued strength in advertising was partially offset by several headwinds. As sellers and buyers adjust to the new trade policies, we are seeing an uptick in returned and canceled orders, which led to a roughly 10 basis point headwind to our Q3 take rate as these transactions are included in GMV, but not revenue. Our average selling price was also increased in recent quarters, mostly driven by category mix shift, which also pressured our take rate. In addition, U.K. C2C represented a modest year-over-year headwind as we continue to scale our managed shipping initiative during Q3.\nLastly, foreign exchange was a headwind of nearly 10 basis points to our take rate year-over-year. Total advertising revenue was $525 million representing GMV penetration of 2.6%. Within the eBay platform, first-party ads grew nearly 23% to $496 million. We continue to deprecate legacy third-party display ads, which declined by 40% to $7 million. Off-platform ads grew 32%, reaching $22 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.6% declined by over 80 basis points year-over-year due to expected headwinds from managed shipping, traffic acquisition costs related to promoted off-site ads, depreciation expenses and foreign exchange. These factors were partially offset by tax-related tailwinds as we lapped onetime expenses a year ago and continued cost of payment efficiencies in the quarter.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin was 27.1%, down 10 basis points year-over-year, including a foreign exchange headwind of 10 basis points. Marketing and operating efficiencies generated leverage in the quarter, which was partially offset by product development expenses. As we noted last quarter, given the recent strength in our business, we are reinvesting a portion of top line upside in order to accelerate our strategic initiatives, including eBay Live, shipping solutions and vehicles. We are also expanding our global employee footprint in order to optimize our location strategy and to comply with U.S. data transfer policies. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.36 and up over 14% year-over-year and GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.28, down 1% year-over-year as we lapped investment gains in Q3 of last year.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $803 million in Q3 and ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $6.8 billion on our balance sheet. Our equity investments were valued at over $900 million. We repurchased $625 million of eBay shares in Q3 at an average price of nearly $88 an and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $132 million in September or $0.29 per share.\nMoving on to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect GMV between $20.5 billion and $20.9 billion, representing FX-neutral growth between 4% and 6% year-over-year. Based on current exchange rates, we estimate FX would represent roughly 180 basis points of tailwind to spot GMV growth. Our guidance reflects a continuation of the durable growth trends we've observed in recent quarters driven by our momentum in focus categories and other strategic initiatives. Additionally, as commodity prices for precious metals have appreciated in recent months, we've observed a notable acceleration in demand for bullion and collectible coins on eBay, which may be a less durable trend. Our acquisition of TIs is also expected to contribute roughly 10 basis points to total FX-neutral GMV growth in Q4. These tailwinds are expected to be offset by a few lapping dynamics.\nIn Q4 of last year, we observed exceptional GMV growth in trading cards due to a strong release calendar. We also saw a double-digit improvement in U.K. C2C volume growth and better-than-expected holiday season demand overall. This year, we will also face a full quarter of impact from the removal of global de minimis exemption versus a single month of impact in Q3. We expect the net of these headwinds to lead to a modest deceleration in GMV growth during Q4. We forecast revenue to be between $2.83 billion and $2.89 billion, implying FX-neutral growth of 8% to 10% year-over-year.\nBased on current exchange rates, we estimate FX would represent roughly 190 basis points of tailwind to spot revenue growth. Our guidance implies year-over-year take rate expansion primarily due to our remonetization of U.K. C2C volume and first-party advertising growth, partially offset by mix shift and headwinds related to trade policy.\nAs I noted for GMV, we expect a full quarter impact from the de minimis change to apply incremental pressure on our core take rate, advertising and financial services monetization. On a sequential basis, take rate is expected to be modestly lower due to these factors as well as normal Q4 seasonality attributable to category and ASP mix over the holidays. We expect non-GAAP operating margin between 25.8% and 26.3% in Q4, representing non-GAAP operating income growth between 5% and 9% as reported. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily due to continued investment in our strategic initiatives as we reinvest a portion of our top line strength in order to drive medium- to long-term growth.\nWe forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.31 and $1.36 in Q4, representing year-over-year growth between 5% and 9%. We expect net interest income to become a headwind to year-over-year earnings growth in Q4, given prevailing interest rates and our lower cash balance. We forecast capital expenditure to be between 4% and 5% of revenue for the full year, and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We expect reported free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion for this year, including a headwind of $935 million from the unique tax items we paid this past Q2. On a normalized basis, free cash flow is expected to be roughly $2.5 billion for 2025.\nLastly, we continue to plan on repurchasing approximately $2.5 billion of our shares for the full year. In addition, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter to be paid in December.\nNext, I'll share a few preliminary thoughts on 2026. We are planning our business around the third consecutive year of positive FX neutral GMV and revenue growth, reflecting our confidence in our initiatives and a continuation of the strong underlying momentum from this year. However, we are also mindful of several notable lapping dynamics in 2026. These include exceptionally high growth in trading cards and more recently, in bullion and coins and unexpectedly strong marketing efficiency.\nIn aggregate, we estimate these factors could represent a lapping consideration of approximately 2 points of GMV growth for the full year in 2026. In addition, we expect to face incremental headwinds from annualizing breakage associated with the global de minimis changes. If the current level of impact remains stable throughout 2026, it would result in a headwind to FX-neutral GMV growth of approximately 1 point. We expect the gap between GMV and revenue growth to be relatively narrow in 2026 as continued healthy growth in first-party advertising revenue is expected to be partially offset by pressure on cross-border sellers and a higher mix of GMV from emerging businesses like vehicles and eBay Live next year, which have lower average take rates.\nWith regards to profitability, as we finalize our planning decisions, we'll maintain our focus on targeting the optimal combination of GMV growth and operating margin to maximize operating income dollar growth over the medium to long term. We expect to face a few modest headwinds in 2026 below the operating income line. Our lower cash balance and the expected slope of interest rates would pressure our net interest income year-over-year and we are reevaluating our non-GAAP tax rate in 2026 and beyond, which may result in a modest increase partially due to the U.S. tax dynamics.\nFinally, a few observations on capital allocation. We expect to return approximately $3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in 2025, which would amount to over $12 billion of capital returns to shareholders from 2022 to 2025. Over the last few years, we were pleased to monetize several equity investments at attractive valuations, including Adevinta, Adient and G Market. These asset sales enabled us to return significantly more capital to shareholders than our normalized free cash flow.\nGoing forward, our framework for capital allocation has not changed. Our priority remains organic investment in the business to drive sustainable growth, and we will continue to evaluate inorganic opportunities to accelerate our road map. With regard to excess capital, we will continue to lean into returns to shareholders. Given our remaining investment portfolio, we do expect that free cash flow from our core business will be the primary source for capital returns in 2026 and beyond. In a normal year, we plan to target repurchases and cash dividends totaling between 90% to 100% of normalized free cash flow, absent organic or inorganic needs for that capital.\nIn closing, we believe our strong Q3 results and Q4 guidance reflect the momentum we are seeing in our business. Our strategy is working, and we believe much of our growth is sustainable. We are taking advantage of the strength in our business this year and making incremental investments in focus categories, C2C, eBay Live, shipping, vehicles, Gen AI and other areas, which will help drive balanced top line and bottom line growth over the medium to long term.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

My name is Megan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the eBay Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Egbert, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Egbert\n\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you all for joining us for eBay's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Peggy Alford, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that during this conference call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our accompanying slide presentation. Additionally, all growth rates noted in our prepared remarks will reflect organic FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons, and all earnings per share amounts reflect earnings per diluted share, unless indicated otherwise.\nDuring this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of July 30, 2025. We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the second quarter. Then I'll go deeper on the fundamental drivers of our results and progress against our strategic initiatives. Following my remarks, I will turn the call over to Peggy, our new CFO, and who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail before we open up the call for Q&A.\nWe delivered another strong quarter in Q2 with all of our key financial metrics, exceeding both consensus expectations and the high end of our respective guidance ranges. Our gross merchandise volume grew by 4% to $19.5 billion, accelerating by over 2 points sequentially. Revenue grew by more than 4% to $2.73 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 8% to $775 million, and our non-GAAP earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year to $1.37. These results are a testament to our continued progress in reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. The fundamental drivers of our return to profitable growth remain intact, while our marketplace has proven resilient to recent uncertainty brought on by tariffs and trade policy changes.\nNow let's go deeper into the key drivers behind our Q2 performance. Our focus categories continue to be a significant engine of growth for eBay. In Q2, focused category GMV grew by over 10%, outpacing our core categories by 9 percentage points. This momentum was broad-based as all of our individual focus categories accelerated year-over-year during Q2. Collectibles was once again the largest contributor to growth as year-over-year growth in trading cards GMV accelerated for the tenth straight quarter on the back of continued momentum in both collectible card games and sports trading cards. Interest in Pokemon cards has surged recently, with GMV growth in the triple digits for the second straight quarter, amid renewed interest from collectors and a particularly strong slate of product releases. While we expect to start lapping elevated growth in Pokemon in Q4, we continue to see strong secular growth across all our major trading card subcategories.\nFor instance, sports trading cards and MAGIC: THE GATHERING also accelerated sequentially, the GMV growth for each remains in the healthy double digits year-over-year. Our TCGPlayer subsidiary is also consistently posting healthy double-digit GMV growth and set a new record for weekly GMV during its Mayhem event in Q2, which coincided with the pre-release window for the highly anticipated final fantasy universes beyond crossover. Overall, we remain confident in the durability for the trading cards category even if our growth is not linear from quarter-to-quarter due to the varying cadence and relative strength of product release cycles. Our strategic initiatives and partnerships have meaningfully contributed to our recent momentum in collectibles as we improve on our industry-leading experience for During Q2, we fully ramped our grading add-on solution in the U.S. in partnership with PSA and continue to see healthy attach rates. We introduced bulk selling capabilities for cards added to my collection to effortlessly populate multiple listings with just a few clicks. We began integrating inventory from Golden auctions into the eBay marketplace, generating more exposure for these highest listings. And our Golden subsidiary acquired Studio Auctions, which expands our offering for collectors of Hollywood and pop cultural memorabilia. Motors, parts and accessories or P&A, also contributed nearly 1 point of year-over-year GMV growth for our overall enterprise, driven by strength across our major markets and trade quarters. While we've observed some pressure on direct shipped inventory from Greater China following tariff increases and removal of the de minimis exemption, we've seen increased adoption of SpeedPAK and resilient growth trends within forward-deployed inventory.\nWe also continue to expand buyers access to well-priced supply in key areas like used and green parts, many of which are sourced in their local markets. In the U.S., we've begun automating the enhancement of fitment data to P&A listings in recent quarters, which exposes them to a larger number of relevant auto part shoppers. And in July, we launched easy and free returns for P&A in the U.S., which enables buyers to easily return eligible purchases for any reason, further improving our leading value proposition for auto enthusiasts. Our luxury and apparel focused categories also contributed positively to growth in Q2. In recent months, we've expanded the number of streetwear and luxury apparel brands eligible for authentication in the U.S. And in June, we launched luxury apparel authentication in the U.K., covering dozens of the world's most sought-after brands.\nOur Authenticity Guarantee program achieved 2 significant milestones in Q2, inspecting over 1 million items in a single quarter for the first time and reaching a total of more than 15 million cumulative items processed through our authentication centers. Our momentum in fashion continues to benefit from improved consideration among enthusiasts, which has been amplified by our full funnel marketing strategy.\nIn May, we sponsored the Met Gala live stream, and had a major presence on the red carpet, resulting in nearly 5 billion earned media impressions. eBay became the first non-designer brand to dress attendees head to toe with celebrities like Chappell Roan, Emma Chamberlain and Jeremy Pope wearing pre-loved and vintage items sourced from eBay. Our marketing efforts have also benefited from our increased capabilities in generative AI. In recent months, we've started leveraging Gen AI to optimize listing titles in our product listing ads syndicated to Google, resulting in measurably higher quality scores, ranking and overall performance for these listings, leading to incremental GMV.\nWe have also leveraged proprietary models to detect and replace low quality or clutter listing images with higher-quality AI-generated alternatives for Google PLAs, which has increased the acceptance rate on these listings and shown a significant lift to GMV. We're also leveraging generative AI to drive personalized engagement with our customers. In late 2024, we introduced AI-generated subject lines and headers for personalized CRM e-mails in the U.S., which drove a greater than 40% increase in quality visits versus our prior approach. In recent months, we've expanded this feature to the U.K. and have seen similar results. We are now expanding these personalized e-mails to more use cases such as abandoned carts and followed seller e-mails.\nWe've leveraged proprietary LLM to generate these personalized messages. And our teams have managed to keep GPU utilization costs low by optimizing customer segmentation as we've seen the strongest uplift when focusing on our enthusiast customers. We're already sending millions of these tailored e-mails each week and plan to continue leveraging generative AI to personalize more touch points of the customer experience through CRM channels. Our geo-specific initiatives represent another key building block for growth in 2025, and we made notable progress on our U.K. initiative during Q2. Since launching a suite of new capabilities to upgrade the consumer-to-consumer experience in the U.K. in Q4, we have seen notably stronger GMV growth trends versus our prior baseline even after introducing a buyer-facing fee in Q1. During Q2, we continued to scale adoption of our managed shipping solution for U.K. C2C sellers as we introduce new features and functionality. We added package collection services for convenience, and a delivered store feature that enables buyers to have their item shipped to anyone of over 10,000 every parcel shops or lockers in the U.K., which yields significant cost savings relative to home delivery.\nIn late Q2, we began mandating adoption of managed shipping for all new C2C listings outside of certain edge cases. Over the next few months, we plan to continue improving the managed shipping experience by adding new solutions for bulky items and age-verified products. We are also planning to expand the thousands more collection and drop-off points in the U.K. and drive awareness of the cost savings and sustainability benefits of adopting these services. These enhancements built upon the already strong value proposition that managed shipping offers, faster listing times, lower shipping costs, greater transparency from added tracking and protection against lost or damaged items.\neBay Live is another major area of focus and investment in 2025. eBay Live brings our most engaged communities to life, transforming how enthusiasts discover, assess and compete for high demand inventory in real time. It's a natural extension of our leadership in categories like trading cards, fashion and luxury goods, where trust, storytelling and scarcity are core to the purchase experience. By layering live commerce on top of our scaled marketplace, we're creating new shopping experiences where sellers can connect directly with their audience and like-minded buyers can engage with each other, all while leveraging the sellers, inventory and demand we already have. GMV and watch time for eBay Live continues to grow quarter after quarter as we onboard more sellers into the program.\neBay Live initially ramped within the trading cards category, but during Q2, we saw accelerating contributions from luxury watches, jewelry, handbags and pre-loved apparel. In May, we formally launched eBay Live in the U.K. market alongside a major activation at London. Our teams also continue to innovate on the live commerce experience for sellers and buyers. During the quarter, we introduced a redesigned host console for sellers that enables real-time edits to listings, item lineup viewing and a greater number of one-click actions to increase sales velocity. In the U.S., we launched 2 of our most requested features for eBay Live, auto charge and combined shipping capabilities, which improve trust and reduce friction.\nWe also debuted eBay Live on tour, a series of in-person events, bringing eBay live to the community via trade nights, hobby parties and pop culture events. We see eBay live as a way to harness the power of the vibrant communities that have organically developed on eBay over the past 30 years. We have already seen significant evidence that live commerce can deepen engagement among eBay enthusiasts and unlock even greater velocity in our strongest verticals, which validates our continued investment in this experience.\nTurning next to advertising. During Q2, our first-party advertising revenue on the eBay platform grew 17%, driven by balanced growth across our ads portfolio. Active Promoted Listings made up nearly 1.2 billion of the close to 2.4 billion total listings on eBay, while 4.1 million sellers adopted a single Promoted Listings product during the quarter. Within Promoted Listings, general adds were the largest contributor to the year-over-year growth in Q2, followed by priority adds and promoted offsite units. Promoted stores also continue to scale quickly off of a small base. During the quarter, we implemented several optimizations for our ads portfolio that contributed to growth, such as leveraging proprietary models, trained on more granular buyer behavior to service more relevant products, and using LLM to analyze search queries and surface more relevant promoted products. We also extended priority ads to vehicle sellers for the first time, enabling both dealers and C2C sellers to generate more exposure for their vehicle listings.\nWithin Payments and Financial Services, we continue to focus on enhancing buyer choice, reducing conversion friction and expanding our solutions for sellers. A key highlight this quarter was the successful expansion of our partnership with Klarna into the U.S. market on April 1, building on our established global strategic partnership. Following our successful expansion in Europe late last year, Klarna's U.S. launch has surpassed our initial expectations in terms of incremental GMV and new and reactivated buyers. The average order value on Klarna's transactions is approximately 3x the U.S. marketplace average. While adoption has been particularly strong in focused categories like P&A, fashion and electronics. Klarna is also helping us attract a younger demographic with roughly 50% of sales coming from Gen Z and millennial buyers and a higher mix of sales generated by female shoppers.\nBeyond Klarna, our other financial services initiatives continued to deliver value for customers. In the U.K., our eBay balance feature continues to gain traction, enabling our several million active U.K. C2C sellers to utilize their sales earnings for eBay purchases, generating incremental GMV and while lowering our payment costs in the process. Our seller capital program continues to empower small businesses with access to crucial funding, having dispersed over $100 million of growth capital year-to-date to more than 10,000 sellers globally.\nBeyond our operational performance, our dedication to the impact and sustainability of our marketplace continues to be recognized. I'm proud to share that eBay was named one of Time World's most sustainable companies and Newsweek's world's greenest companies 2025, underscoring our unwavering commitment to e-commerce and a healthier planet. Our purpose-driven community also continues its incredible work, notably through the eBay Foundation's One Good Thing campaign, where more than 8,500 volunteer hours and over $790,000 were donated by employees and the eBay Foundation to over 250 nonprofits globally, truly embodying our mission to create economic opportunity for all.\nIn closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay, demonstrating the continued momentum of our strategy and resilience of our marketplace. Focused categories remain an engine of growth for our marketplace and accelerated to 10% GMV growth. Our U.K. business is benefiting from a similar playbook being deployed at the geographic level with GMV growth comfortably above our baseline before our investments in overhauling the C2C experience. AI continues to fundamentally change the eBay experience for customers as we streamline the listing experience, improve the efficacy of search to connect the right buyers in inventory, created more inspirational shopping experiences and enhanced trust throughout our marketplace.\nAdditionally, we are increasingly leveraging AI to improve the effectiveness of our advertising products and marketing and personalize our CRM communications with our enthusiast customers. We also continue to invest in medium- and longer-term initiatives like eBay Live in our vehicles business enabled by the acquisition of Caramel, which are contributing modestly to GMV in 2025, but represent significant opportunities in the years to come. As we approach the 30th anniversary of eBay's founding in September, I would like to thank our teams for the significant progress they've made in reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts in recent years. Their unwavering dedication towards our mission has kept us firmly on the path towards sustainable long-term growth, yielding significant value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Peggy who will provide more details on our financial performance and outlook. Peggy, over to you.\n\nPeggy M. Alford\n\nExecutive VP of Global Sales, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie. I'm incredibly excited to return to eBay and help build on the strong foundation we have in place in order to accelerate our transformation. The opportunity ahead is significant, and I look forward to partnering with Jamie and the rest of our leadership team to drive the next chapter of eBay's growth story.\nI will begin with the financial highlights of the second quarter. GMV grew 4% to $19.5 billion. Revenue grew over 4% to $2.73 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 8% to $775 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 16% to $1.37. In addition, we returned approximately $760 million to shareholders through repurchases and cash dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial and operating metrics. GMV grew 4% to $19.5 billion in Q2 on an organic FX-neutral basis. The strength in the quarter was primarily driven by the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and more favorable trends in the U.S., where consumer demand improved through Q2, and the impact of tariffs was more muted than we anticipated.\nGolden added over 10 basis points of growth in the quarter and we lapped the acquisition in mid-May. Foreign exchange also provided a tailwind of roughly 170 basis points to spot GMV growth. Focus categories were a key driver of our performance, growing over 10% in Q2. We saw year-over-year growth rates accelerate sequentially across all focused categories, luxury goods, collectibles, refurbished, sneakers, P&A and apparel. In the U.S. market, GMV growth accelerated to 7% and exceeded our expectations due to several factors. Healthy consumer demand drove broad-based strength across both focus and core categories with particularly strong performance in trading cards. Our U.S. results were driven by growth in both sold items and average selling prices. The increase in ASP was partly attributable to category mix shift and also our expansion of our Klarna partnership to the U.S. market, which improved conversion on high ticket items.\nWe also observed enhanced efficiency in our lower funnel marketing spend, partly due to competitive dynamics. International GMV grew nearly 2% on an FX-neutral basis, with foreign exchange providing a tailwind of more than 330 basis points to spot growth. Our investments in the U.K. and Germany have been instrumental in helping us navigate lower growth environments in both countries. Our cross-border volume growth in Q2 was similar to Q1 as U.S. tariffs have had a limited impact on GMV to date. We did experience some disruption to direct shipments from Greater China to the U.S. following the elimination of de minimis exemption, but the volume that persisted saw an uplift to ASP.\nAs a reminder, the vast majority of our volume in this corridor is either forward deployed where tariffs are applied against sellers' wholesale cost, or utilizes our shipping service feedback, which helps sellers and buyers navigate applicable tariffs. Moving on to our biometrics. Our trailing 12-month active buyers were $134 million in Q2, up 1% year-over-year. Enthusiast buyers remained stable at roughly $16 million and spend per enthusiast buyer continued to grow year-over-year, reaching nearly $3,200 in Q2.\nShifting to our income statement. Revenue grew over 4% to $2.73 billion in Q2 on an organic FX-neutral basis. Foreign exchange was a tailwind of nearly 170 basis points to spot growth. Our take rate was 14%, up modestly year-over-year. Advertising, shipping and financial services contributed positively to take rate, which was offset by our U.K. C2C initiative and mix shift across our categories and geographies.\nOn a sequential basis, U.K. C2C improved overall take rate by over 20 basis points in Q2, benefiting from a full quarter of buyer protection fee contribution and our managed shipping ramp. Advertising revenue was $482 million, representing GMV penetration of nearly 2.5%. Within the eBay platform, first-party ads grew roughly 17% to $455 million. We continue to deprecate legacy third-party display ads, which declined by 43% to $8 million. Off-platform adds grew 46%, reaching $19 million. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by over 20 basis points year-over-year as pressure from shipping initiatives, traffic acquisition costs related to promoted offsite ads and depreciation expenses was more than offset by cost of payments efficiencies as we lapped onetime tax expenses in the prior year.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%, up roughly 50 basis points year-over-year as volume leverage and contributions from advertising, financial services and marketing efficiencies offset headcount-related costs our U.K. C2C initiative and M&A expenses. Additionally, FX represented a 40 basis points tailwind to operating margin in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.37, up 16%; and GAAP earnings per share was $0.79, up 77%. The higher GAAP earnings growth rate was primarily due to the lapping of investment losses a year ago.\nMoving to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow was negative $441 million, in line with our expectations due to roughly $935 million of cash outflows in the quarter relating to taxes on equity investment sales last year and our final repatriation tax payment. We repurchased $625 million of eBay shares in Q2 at an average price of $71 and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $134 million in June or $0.29 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had cash and nonequity investments of $5.4 billion and gross debt of $6.7 billion on our balance sheet. Our equity investments were valued at over $900 million.\nIn May, we received approximately $225 million from shareholder distribution. This return of capital reduced the carrying value of our investment to approximately $650 million at the end of Q2. Turning to our outlook. While the environment remains uncertain, our business has performed well in July, reflecting sustained healthy consumer trends in the U.S. and continued execution of our strategic initiatives. For the third quarter, we expect GMV between $19.2 million and $19.6 billion, representing FX-neutral growth between 3% and 5% year-over-year. Based on current exchange rates, we estimate FX would represent roughly 170 basis points of tailwind to spot GMV growth.\nWhile we have largely navigated the impact of tariffs to date, our guidance range does contemplate potential disruptions from impending tariffs and the potential elimination of de minimis exemptions on other trade corridors. We forecast revenue between $2.69 billion and $2.74 billion, implying FX-neutral growth of 3% to 5%. Based on current exchange rates, we estimate an FX tailwind of roughly 120 basis points to spot revenue growth. On a sequential basis, this implies take rate is roughly flat as advertising and managed shipping monetization are expected to be offset by an FX headwind of 10 basis points and some additional pressure from mix shift. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 to be between 26.6% and 27.1%, representing non-GAAP operating income growth between 2% and 6% as reported. We remain focused on maintaining a disciplined balance between top and bottom line growth as we invest for the future.\nGiven the year-to-date strength in our business, we intend to reinvest a portion of further top line upside and strategic initiatives aimed at driving long-term value for shareholders. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.29 and and $1.34, representing year-over-year growth between 8% and 12%. Next, I'll share some updated thoughts on the full year. For 2025, our GMB is tracking towards the high end or slightly above our prior expected range of low single-digit FX neutral growth. We continue to view much of the year-to-date strength in our business as durable, particularly the momentum within focus categories and contributions from other strategic initiatives. However, our outlook for the remainder of the year contemplates several mitigating factors to recent GMV trends. First, we faced tougher year-over-year comparisons in Q4 overall due to an especially strong holiday season. Second, we anticipate some potential moderation in trading cards growth in Q4, which improved substantially in late 2024 due to an exceptionally strong series of product releases. Third, we will lap an acceleration in the U.K. C2C volume as we launched our initiative in October of last year. Lastly, we continue to contemplate a range of scenarios regarding tariffs as new trade policies are announced and implemented.\nWe forecast revenue growth modestly higher than GMV for the full year on an FX-neutral basis, driven by advertising, shipping and financial services. We expect non-GAAP operating income growth between 4% and 5% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, which includes the impact of several unique headwinds to non-GAAP operating margin outlined in our earnings presentation. We forecast capital expenditures to be between 4% and 5% of revenue for the full year and expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We now expect reported free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion in 2025, which includes a headwind of $935 million from the unique tax items noted earlier. On a normalized basis, free cash flow is expected to be comfortably north of $2 billion. We are now targeting share repurchases of approximately $2.5 billion for the full year. Additionally, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share for Q3 to be paid in September. Based on these assumptions, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share growth between 10% and 12% year-over-year in 2025.\nBefore we start Q&A, I'd just like to reiterate how thrilled I am to be joining as eBay's CFO and helping lead the company into our next stage of growth, focusing on categories where we are uniquely positioned to win. What I've seen so far has been impressive and energizing from the level of innovation and collaboration of our teams, the increased focus on serving the needs of our customers and our deep commitment to connecting people and building communities to create economic opportunity for all. We are uniquely positioned to thrive in this next stage of growth. We have a strong balance sheet, clear strategic priorities and a world-class team. My focus will be on driving operational excellence and disciplined allocation of capital to support our longer-term growth ambitions, unlocking significant value for our shareholders in the process. And I look forward to meeting our shareholders and analysts community soon.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our strong Q2 results marked a notable step toward our goal of achieving sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. Our gross merchandise volume grew 1% to $18.4 billion in Q2. Revenue increased 2% to $2.57 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin rose by 1 point to 27.9%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share rose by approximately 15% to $1.18, and we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends during the quarter.\nI'm proud of our teams for delivering these results amid continued macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and an evolving regulatory landscape.\nNow let's walk through some of the key drivers of our Q2 results. Focused category GMV grew by over 4% in Q2, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 5 points. After motors, parts and accessories or P&A, which continued its trend of healthy growth, Collectibles was the second largest contributor to GMV growth among focused categories in Q2. In mid-May, we closed a series of transactions with collectors, parent company of PSA and a leading provider of authentication and grading services for collectibles. Since then, we've made significant progress towards integrating Golden, expanding our relationship with PSA and elevating the eBay principles experience. We support the latest Golden 100 auction helped drive awareness for the successful global premiere of King of Collectibles Season 2 on Netflix and the Golden team began hosting events on eBay Live.\nDuring Q2, we completed the transfer of trading card assets to the PSA vault ahead of schedule, and all PSA customers can now easily sell on eBay at the time of grading without having their cards sit back to -- just going live in late June, the PSA storefront has already sold tens of thousands of trading cards on eBay, and I'm excited for our companies to jointly drive innovation on behalf of hobbyist for years to come.\neBay refurbished was also a significant contributor to GMV growth and was our fastest-growing focus category year-over-year as our combination of trust, value and quality continues to resonate with customers. Our selection of refurbished inventory continues to grow as we expand existing partnerships with OEMs like Dyson, onboard CVT sellers with access to unique items and extend the program to new categories.\nDuring Q2, we expanded eBay refurbished to golf clubs, bringing warranties and hassle-free returns to thousands of previously owned golf clubs from the world's top brands. In June, we announced the sustainability collaboration with Seagate, a global leader in data storage solutions. We launched Seagate's official storefront on eBay for direct sales of factory recertified hard drives. Not only are these refurbished products a great value for consumers, but this partnership can also eliminate a significant amount of e-waste by extending the product life cycles of quality hard drives.\nConsumers' desire to shop sustainably has also benefited our luxury focused categories, which delivered positive year-over-year GMV growth for the sixth straight quarter. As we acquire more sellers with well-priced luxury inventory, we have observed a strong correlation with incremental GMV. For instance, we saw a significant acceleration in cross-border demand after the opening of our Tokyo authentication center, which led to a meaningful expansion of our luxury handbag inventory.\nWe reached a major milestone for our authenticity guarantee program in Q2. We authenticated our 10th million items since the inception of the program in 2020. A pair of Air Jordan one low and Lucky green sneakers authenticated in our Las Vegas facility.\nDuring Q2, we also introduced optional authentication for luxury handbags, priced between $200 and $500 in the U.S. which enables even more buyers and sellers to enjoy the benefits of our authenticity guarantee program. As our value proposition continues to grow, it's been exciting to see how partnerships have enabled eBay to show up in so many culturally relevant moments recently. These opportunities help us to evolve perceptions of eBay by showcasing our modernized experiences and connect with more enthusiasts shopping in pursuits of their passion. Just in the last quarter, Lala Anthony and Madeline Klein showcased their pre-loved luxury accessories from eBay on the MetGalla-red carpet. We saw eBay logos in the cockpits of Lando Norris and Oscar Pia Street as the McLaren Formula One team took the checkered flag at the Miami Grand Prix.\nWe partnered with Disney to create a customized destination from May 4, enabling us to engage with Star Wars enthusiasts around the world as they explore the more than 1 million Star Wars-related collectable products on eBay. And in June, eBay returned as the headline sponsor for Love Island in the U.K. showcasing the power of pre-loved fashion to millions of households nationwide.\nNext, I'd like to update you on some of the geo-specific investments we've been making. In March 2023, we repurposed our strategic playbook for focused categories to better serve the needs of German consumers. This endeavor has reinvigorated our C2C business in Germany and helped us navigate challenging economic conditions in the region. In Q2, we sustained positive year-over-year growth in C2C volume in Germany as we lap the full first quarter of this initiative. Healthier C2C trends have also supported our B2C business in the German market. The unique inventory listed by consumer sellers has led to a healthier customer acquisition funnel. When consumers begin selling, they also purchased twice as much on eBay as non-sellers on average, with most of that incremental volume benefiting B2C sellers.\nThe success of the German initiative influenced our decision to invest in an improved experience for preowned apparel in the U.K. last quarter. These changes, including a new selling flow that makes it considerably easier to list on eBay with image guidance, simpler item aspect collection and a streamlined shipping module with a focused set of couriers and parameters. For buyers, we introduced optimized vertical browsing pages for fashion and new generative AI-powered buying experiences like Shop the look and Explore. Although we're only a few months in, we're seeing positive leading indicators in the strategically important category.\nFor users of the new selling flow, we have observed a 20-point increase in CSET, a material reduction in average listing time and an increase in listings and sold items per seller. A growing number of buyers have engaged with our new AI-powered fashion shopping features, and are eagerly awaiting the enhanced personalization and filtering we plan to bring to shop the look and explore in the coming months.\nThese shopping experiences are emblematic of the overall acceleration in the pace of innovation at eBay. Our investments in generative AI and machine learning are simplifying the selling and buying experiences, making our marketplace more efficient and helping us better serve customers at all phases of their shopping journey. To power these experiences, our core AI team is training and fine-tuning large language models using eBay's proprietary data to build even more magical innovations for customers. In Q2, we entered the high-performance computing realm by deploying our first supercomputer, which gave us the capacity to build and fine-tune even larger LOMs on trillions of tokens.\nBased on publicly available performance benchmarks, our supercomputer is on par with some of the top 50 supercomputers in the world in terms of -- our multiphase Magic listing initiative is helping us solve the long-standing trade-off between listing speed and quality. After fully rolling out generative AI descriptions, we are continuing to test and iterate on the next phase of our magical listing experience, which leverages user uploaded product images help sellers fill in the category title and other item aspects for listing. A subset of sellers are testing these experience in beta, and we are leveraging their feedback and expertise to train our models and expand coverage to a broader range of categories. Seller CCEP for this beta experience remains extremely positive, and we plan to expand the beta to more sellers during Q3.\nWe are also leveraging generative AI to help sellers improve the quality of their product imagery. In Q2, we rolled out generative AI-powered background enhancements to 100% of iOS and Android users in the U.S., U.K. and Germany. This feature allows sellers to magically overlay their products on top of a variety of visually stunning backdrops. The customer response to this innovation has been outstanding. CSF for this feature has reached 90% and and more than 2/3 of customers who have tried the feature have applied AI-generated backgrounds to their listings. Within seconds, sellers can easily stage their camping equipment against a beautiful force backdrop showcased their use skis a top to snowcap mountain or display their prebusandals on a beach it sunset. It's exciting to see the creativity of our selling community as they embrace generative AI tools to make their listings more compelling. Turning next to advertising.\nDuring Q2, first-party advertising grew 12% and while total ad revenue approached 2.2% penetration of GMV. Approximately 3.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q2, and we ended the quarter with roughly $1 billion live Promoted Listings out of our nearly $2.1 billion total listings. In early July, we launched a complete redesign of our eBay advertising platform, which fundamentally changed how sellers create and manage their ad campaigns. -- and made it simpler than ever to activate our full range of advertising solutions. This new interface is now available to all sellers across our major markets. It includes the centralized dashboard, enabling sellers to make data-driven decisions by leveraging near real-time performance metrics, including impressions, clicks and return on ad spend.\nFor the first time, sellers can also see a list of personalized campaign recommendations aimed at helping them to achieve their sales goals, such as adding new keywords to increase listing visibility, we're lowering bids for keywords that aren't driving performance. Additionally, we've enhanced suggested campaigns to highlight new ad strategies for sellers by identifying emerging marketplace trends relevant to their inventory, with prebuilt campaigns fully optimized by AI. As part of this redesign, we simplified our first-party advertising portfolio into 3 distinct solutions that more clearly align with the seller's campaign objectives.\nWe unified our standard, advanced and Express products into a single promoted listing solution, serving both fixed price and auction formats. When sellers launch a Promoted Listings campaign, they can pay on a cost per action basis for general placement or select cost per click pricing for priority placement. In addition, promoted offsite ads enables us to tap into a wider audience through off EV channels such as Google. Promoted offsite uses a dynamic CPC model and automated targeting to users can set up campaigns in just a few clicks after setting a daily budget. And our newest format, promoted stores enable sellers to increase their brand visibility when buyers are browsing or searching for contextually relevant items. Ultimately, we believe the redesign experience will help more sellers grow their businesses on eBay by broadening the appeal of our full suite of advertising solutions, delivering actionable insights in a more intuitive interface.\nOur payments platform continues to be a strategic growth driver for our marketplace more than 2 years after the completion of our migration. In recent years, we have added a breadth of popular and locally relevant payment options to offer even more choice and flexibility during the checkout experience. We were thrilled to launch Venmo as a payment option in the U.S. in Q2, enabling us to tap into its more than 90 million engaged users. Venmo's mobile-first checkout experiences and strong adoption among Gen Z and millennial audiences are particularly appealing as we continue to broaden our reach in younger demographics. The early results of this partnership are encouraging as a significant portion of our GMV from Venmo is coming from new or reactivated buyers.\nOur research has shown us that timely access to affordable financing is a key enabler for small businesses, which makes Seller Capital a pathway to unlocking more great inventory on eBay. In July, we expanded our seller capital offering with the launch of business cash advance on eBay. -- a revenue-based financing solution provided by Liberis. This product connects eligible U.S. sellers with fast, flexible and transparent financing for up to $1 million in working capital in as little as 24 hours. Sellers can tap into flexible payment schedules that scale with their sales cycle and easily track their payback progress within the Seller Hub. In just a few weeks since launch, we've already funded over 1,000 sellers and dispersed millions of dollars of working capital.\nNow I'd like to share some highlights around eBay's impact of the company. Last quarter, we published our 2023 impact report, showcasing how the company is creating economic opportunities and promoting a sustainable future. We remain on track toward our sustainability goals, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 car emissions by 59% compared to our 2019 baseline. We also published our 2024 e-commerce report, which analyzes the overall trends and sentiment around e-commerce at a global level. The report found that 86% of consumers surveyed have bought or sold prelims and 70% planned to purchase re-commerce items this year. Younger demographics are especially passionate about the circular economy with more than 90% of millennial and Gen Z sellers saying they value eBay's ability to keep items out of landfills. And on the topic of e-commerce, one of the highlights of the second quarter was the Rocket Man resale event, a partnership with Elton John who released a personal collection of prelunch fashion items exclusively on eBay. The event kicked off with a pop-up shop in the West Village of New York City, where Elton shared stories about items from his legendary closet during eBay live events. Fans around the world were able to pick up pieces of fashion history ranging from Gucci Jackets and Versace robes to customize protalopers and vintage concerts. All proceeds benefited the Elton John Aids Foundation and its mission to be a powerful force in ending the Aids epidemic.\nOur broader community also continues to support the causes most important to them. eBay for Charity raised more than $47 million last quarter up 22% year-over-year. Additionally, the eBay Foundation granted nearly $7 million in Q2 to strategic nonprofits, which are addressing and removing barriers to entrepreneurship for historically excluded groups. I'm proud to share that eBay was recently recognized by Fortune as 1 of America's most innovative companies. We were also acknowledged by Forbes as one of the best employers for new grants recognizing companies who offer the best early career opportunities.\nIn closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay and an important step toward our goal of sustainable long-term growth. or turned positive due to continued momentum in focus categories, investments in geo-specific initiatives and horizontal innovation driven by our growing capabilities in artificial intelligence. Our advertising business -- is while layering disciplined investments for the future, generating double-digit earnings per share growth and delivering compelling capital returns for shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and context on the full year before we begin Q&A.\nMy comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis, unless I know otherwise. We exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q2, driven by our execution against strategic initiatives despite an uneven discretionary demand environment in our major markets. Gross merchandise volume returned to positive growth, up 1% to $18.4 billion. Revenue grew 2% to $2.57 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 1 point to 27.9%. We delivered $1.18 of non-GAAP earnings per share up nearly 15% and we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial performance during the second quarter. On an organic FX-neutral basis, gross merchandise volume grew 1% to $18.4 billion. GMV would still have grown nearly 1% when adjusting for the roughly 50 basis points of impact from favorable Easter timing in 2024. Our acquisition of Golden contributed nearly 20 basis points to total FX-neutral GMV growth in Q2 after the deal closed on May 16. In addition, foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly 20 basis points to year-over-year GMV growth on a spot basis.\nOur teams continue to execute against our strategy including focused category expansion, country-specific investments and horizontal initiatives. The culmination of these efforts over recent quarters, combined with consumers looking for value, helped offset continued pressure on discretionary spending across our 3 largest markets. Focused category GMV grew over 4% in aggregate or nearly 5 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace, driven by broad-based momentum as P&A, collectibles refurbished and luxury goods, all contributed to growth. GMV for the rest of our marketplace was nearly flat in Q2 accelerating by more than 1 point in Q1, which reflects the continued progress of our horizontal innovation and geo-specific product initiatives.\nNext, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV grew by nearly 1 point in Q2, but organic traffic and conversion improved in the U.S., which helped us narrow our GAAP to U.S. e-commerce market growth. Collectibles was a key contributor to U.S. growth, including trading costs, where organic trends have improved in recent quarters, aided by our strategic investments and partnerships.\nInternational GMV grew by over 1% on an FX-neutral basis, while FX was a 30 basis point headwind to spot growth. In the U.K., we noted some softness in C2C volumes to start the year. when the new U.K. digital sales reporting requirements came into effect. We are working to mitigate this pressure by educating sellers on these reporting laws and through initiatives to improve the selling and buying experience in prone Port, which Jamie touched on earlier.\nIn Germany, our focused category and horizontal investments helped offset prevailing macro headwinds. In addition, cross-border trade has been a key driver of international GMV growth in recent quarters. Greater China and Japan have powered this growth by providing great inventory for buyers across our major markets. In fact, our focused category coverage within CBT is even higher than our marketplace overall. In Japan, in particular, has seen its volume growth accelerate since we opened our authentication center there last year. Looking forward, we see more opportunities to onboard quality sellers in these regions and make it easier for them to bring attractive inventory to our marketplace.\nMoving on to buyers. Trading 12-month active buyers and enthused as buyers were once again stable sequentially at approximately $132 million and $16 million, respectively, at the end of Q2. On a year-over-year basis, total active buyer growth was fractionally positive for the first time since early 2021 as new and reactivated buyers remain positive and buyer retention continue to gradually improve. Spend per active buyer was stable, while spend per inspire grew slightly year-over-year to just over $3,100.\nTurning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.57 billion during the second quarter, up 2% as revenue outpaced volume by roughly 1 point. Foreign exchange was a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. Our take rate in Q2 was approximately 14%, up more than 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by first-party advertising. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate was roughly flat as tailwinds from first-party ads, eBay international shipping and payments were offset by C2C initiatives and an FX headwind of approximately 10 basis points.\nTotal advertising revenue grew 8% to $398 million in Q2 and represented nearly 2.2% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew over 12% to $384 million, in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we faced lapping dynamics this quarter due to extraordinary growth in first-party ads in Q2 of last year, when we released CPC ads deferred revenue as a result of the rollout of Halo attribution. In addition, we continue to deprecate our legacy third-party display in Q2, with revenue declining roughly 49% to nearly $14 million.\nShifting to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin declined roughly 30 basis points year-over-year in Q2, due to tax-related matters, including Canadian digital sales tax expenses recognized retroactively from 2022, traffic acquisition costs associated with the ramping offsite ads and foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds were partly offset by operational efficiencies, including lower cost of payments and lower depreciation expenses.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 27.9% in the quarter, improving 1 point year-over-year as operational efficiencies, including our structured cost program more than offset the higher cost of revenue, a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 40 basis points and reinvestments in our full funnel marketing initiatives. As a result, non-GAAP operating income grew 5% year-over-year in Q2, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by nearly 15% and to $1.18. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.45 in the quarter.\nNext, I'll discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow in the second quarter was $278 million, down year over year due to the timing of cash tax payments. Last year, the majority of our tax payments were delayed from Q2 to Q4 due to California's disaster tax relief program. We ended the second quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $6.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. As you will see in our 10-Q filing, on August 1, we will repay $750 million of principal of our senior fixed rate notes coming due. We plan to issue up to $450 million of commercial paper to refinance a portion of those notes over the coming weeks.\nDuring Q2, we repurchased $1 billion of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $52 and had roughly $1.9 billion remaining under our buyback authorization at the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $135 million in June or $0.27 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned $7.3 billion to shareholders to repurchase dividends, nearly 150% of cumulative free cash flow over this period.\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. The consortium led by Premier and Blackstone completed the acquisition of Advent on May 29. We sold approximately 227 million shares and received roughly $2.4 billion in gross proceeds. We incurred over $450 million in cash taxes related to this transaction, which we plan to play next year. Following the deal, we hold approximately 177 million shares or 18% ownership of the outstanding equity valued at roughly $1.9 billion as of the closing date. The consortium has the option through November '29 to purchase from eBay roughly 10% ownership of the private entity to just over $1 billion.\nIn addition, our investment portfolio includes Adient warrants valued at nearly $340 million at the end of Q2. Our Adient warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including Adient share price and the probability of vesting. Our G market investment was valued at roughly $300 million at the end of the quarter.\nMoving to our outlook. We expect to generate GMV between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion in the third quarter, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 1% year-over-year. Total organic FXN growth would be similar as we expect Golden to contribute over 30 basis points of GMV growth in Q3. At current rates, foreign currency would represent a 10 basis point headwind to GMV growth. This outlook balances our strong execution year-to-date again to an uncertain economic and regulatory environment. We forecast revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.56 billion in the third quarter, representing FX-neutral growth of 1% to 3%. We estimate FX would represent more than 0.5 points of headwind to spot revenue growth.\nWe forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating margin between 26.8% and 27.5%, representing a year-over-year expansion between 40 and 110 basis points. This represents a sequential step down in operating margin due to normal seasonality, incremental organic investments and a fourth quarter of M&A-related expenses, including integration costs. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.15 and $1.20 in Q3, representing year-over-year growth between 12% and 17%.\nNow shifting to our expectations for the remainder of the year. Assuming no fundamental change in the macro environment, we expect FX-neutral GMV growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year in Q4, driven by continued execution and focused categories, geo-specific investments and horizontal product delivery. At current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of more than 1 point to spot GMV growth year-over-year in Q4. We forecast Q4 revenue to grow modestly faster than GMV on an FX-neutral basis, implying a narrow growth delta versus Q3. Although we expect similar growth in first-party advertising during Q4, we anticipate modest pressure on core take rate from continued investments in C2C initiatives, mix shift towards higher ASP products and seasonal category mix.\nIn addition, we estimate FX will be a year-over-year benefit of roughly 30 basis points of spot revenue growth in the quarter due to hedging dynamics. We're maintaining our full year outlook for non-GAAP operating margin expansion of between 60 to 100 basis points. As we have noted throughout the year, where we land in this range is not solely tied to volume outcomes. Our strategic investments in 2024, a bit fitual to our return to positive GMV growth. Given our execution to date, we are exploring opportunities for incremental investments to drive durable long-term growth. Additionally, we have absorbed onetime offsets to operating margin in 2024, Notably, about 20 basis points of headwind from M&A expenses including integration costs.\nOur forecast for capital expenditure remains unchanged at between 4% to 5% of revenue for the full year, in line with our historical average. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We continue to expect free cash flow of just under $2 billion for the full year. Given our robust balance sheet position, we are raising our share repurchase target this year to at least $2.5 billion. In addition, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for the third quarter to be paid in September. Given our strong business performance to date, our outlook for the second half, an updated total allocation plan, we are increasing our forecast for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to between 12% and 14% year-over-year for 2024.\nIn closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay despite the uneven macro backdrop. We achieved positive year-over-year GMV growth earlier than expected and maintained double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. In addition, we monetized a significant portion of our Advent stake at an attractive price and increased our full year stock repurchase target. It is a testament to our strong financial model that we are able to deliver healthy, balanced growth while continuing to invest in our business for the long run across focused categories specific geographies and horizon initiative.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered strong results in Q1, even as we continue to navigate ongoing challenges in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was roughly flat at $18.6 billion, while revenue grew more than 2% to $2.56 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share rose 13% to $1.25, and we returned $638 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nI'm incredibly proud of our teams for delivering these results as they remain relentlessly focused on reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. And I am pleased that we remain on track for GMV growth to turn positive by Q3 or Q4 of this year.\nNow let's walk through some of the key drivers of our quarterly results. Focus categories play an important part in delivering relevant experiences to customers on eBay and remained a significant driver of underlying growth on our marketplace during Q1. Overall, focus category GMV grew nearly 5% last quarter, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 6 points.\nMotors, Parts and Accessories or P&A, was once again the largest contributor to growth among focus categories despite facing headwinds in January due to extreme weather patterns in the U.S. Our teams continue to innovate on the P&A shopping experience, growing awareness, enhancing trust and expanding the great inventory our marketplace has to offer.\nFitment is a central component of trust within the P&A category, helping customers understand exactly which of our more than 600 million live listings in this category fit their vehicle. We continue to work closely with large P&A sellers to augment their inventory using the myFitment toolkit. To date, we have enhanced eligible auto parts with approximately 5 billion pieces of incremental fitment data, and we've continued to see a double-digit increase in conversion on these augmented listings.\nAdditionally, last quarter, we redesigned our self-service experience to simplify how sellers on board, view and publish fitment data for P&A listings. Our updated experience better serves small- and medium-sized businesses, which make up our largest cohort of P&A sellers.\nOn the buyer side, we continue to improve our value proposition for mass-market P&A shoppers looking to maintain their vehicles. During Q1, we added a Motors DIY guide page that makes do-it-yourself projects more accessible by integrating expert content for common maintenance jobs alongside eBay listings for the specific parts, tools and materials needed to complete them. Our full funnel approach to marketing has increased awareness and consideration of eBay as a trusted place to shop for auto parts and accessories [indiscernible] consideration of eBay as a trusted place to shop for auto parts and accessories.\nAnd I'm excited that yesterday, we announced a multiyear partnership with the McLaren Racing Formula One team, which means motor sports enthusiasts around the world will see eBay branding on McLaren team race cars starting with the Miami Grand Prix this week.\nEBay has been a leading player in collectibles for over 2 decades. And in recent years, we've accelerated the pace of innovation in areas like trading cards, which is one of our focus categories. We've rolled out new features like MyCollections, price guides, authentication and grading partnerships, revamped condition standards, live commerce, vault storage and new shipping methods to reduce costs.\nIn Q1, we continued to innovate by launching a simplified listing flow for sports trading cards to all U.S. sellers. This experience leverages our proprietary technology to prefile listing with relevant item aspects provide simpler shipping options and offer smarter pricing recommendations based on the value and the condition of the card. This rollout has resulted in a double-digit percentage reduction in listing time and measurable increases in completed listings and sold items per customer. We are also seeing a more than 20% increase in CSAT for U.S. sports trading card sellers versus our baseline prior to this rollout.\nIn recent quarters, we've seen improving volume trends in trading cards as many of the new and returning hobbyists who joined eBay during the pandemic remain highly engaged with our platform. With so much enthusiasm in the [ hobby ], it's the perfect time to talk about the definitive agreement we announced a few weeks ago with collectors, parent company of PSA which is the gold standard in third-party authentication and grading of trading cards and collectibles.\n[ E-band ] collectors have entered into 3 separate transactions designed to streamline and improve the overall experience for hobbies. As part of this deal, I'm incredibly excited to welcome Ken Golden to eBay. We have agreed to acquire Golden, a leading U.S.-based auction house for high-value collectibles which brings together 2 renowned marketplace brands in the trading card hobby. Many of you know Ken from his fantastic series on Netflix, King of Collectibles, the Golden Touch.\nCombining Golden with eBay enhances our respective marketplace offerings by expanding the range of inventory available to eBay customers and opening up an expansive global audience for Golden sellers. We believe this will enable a more well-rounded collecting experience across price points and service models, complementing our acquisition of PCT Player and recent partnership with sports trading card company, [ COMC ].\nAdditionally, eBay has entered into commercial agreements with collectors and PSA to reduce friction in the authentication and grading of training cards. We also agreed to divest the eBay Vault to PSA. Through a newly branded service offering, our companies plan to launch an integrated program to buy, sell, grade and store trading cards. eBay will become PSA's exclusive marketplace partner for trading cards enabling hobbyists to more easily list and sell their cars on eBay at the time of grading.\nImportantly, these deals enable each company to prioritize what it does best. At eBay, we can focus on enhancing our marketplace and streamlining the buying and selling experience for millions of hobbyists, while collectors can concentrate on its operational expertise in grading, authenticating and security storing collectibles. There'll be more we can share about our company's joint plans after the deal is closed, which we expect to occur during Q2, subject to closing conditions.\nIn Q1, we also continued to rapidly innovate on our eBay Live experience, which now spans multiple categories, including collectibles. We expanded coverage to new categories like comics and sports memorabilia. We introduced a revamped auctions experience that makes bidding more seamless and reliable. We enabled viewing on desktop so that buyers can join live events wherever they are shopping. And we dramatically improved the event discoverability on the homepage with personalized recommendations. While eBay Live remains in beta, we are extremely excited about continuing to scale this experience throughout the year.\nAs a pioneer of e-commerce, giving preowned goods a second life is core to who we are as a company. We reached a major milestone in Q1 as preowned and refurbished goods reached 40% of total GMV on our marketplace after consistently outpacing the sales of brand-new goods since the pandemic. In service of that mission, a major priority in 2024 is strengthening our consumer value proposition in pre-owned fashion. Through our multiyear partnership with Love Island in the U.K., we have grown awareness of the sustainability benefits of re-commerce and educate consumers on the potential economic savings from shopping for pre-owned items. But there is more we can do to unlock consumers' closets and accelerate the circular economy.\nTo that end, last month, we began to dramatically streamline the buying and selling experiences for preowned fashion on eBay, focusing on the U.K. We redesigned our shopping experience from the ground up to reduce friction and better meet the needs of modern fashion consumers. Our initial rollout included a number of features and improvements such as the simplified selling flow, curated item specifics, auto guidance, intelligent pricing suggestions and condensed shipping options.\nWe also eliminated final value fees on pre-owned apparel for C2C sellers in the U.K. and introduced new AI-powered tools to enhance discovery and drive more inspirational shopping behavior on our marketplace. One such feature is [ Explore ] a new AI-powered shopping feed, enabling users to browse a nearly unlimited list of personalized recommendations based on implicit and explicit interest signals, such as the users style preferences and sizes. The Explore Feed updates in real-time in response to products that users interact with. While buyers can refine their shopping journey using our visually similar search feature powered by computer vision. Explore is focused on fashion to start, and we plan to expand its capabilities later this year. Explore is currently live for all U.K. users and beta alongside small pilots in other countries as we gather feedback and insights.\nIn April, we also rolled out an early version of [ Shop the Look ], which leverages generative AI to create shoppable content and fashion recommendations. Shop the Look showcases a variety of styles such as business casual, Scandinavian minimalism or urban athleisure. Recommended outlets are linked to visually similar products on eBay drawing from our hundreds of millions of live listings in fashion. Shop the Look is live in iOS in the U.S. and U.K., and we will evolve this experience throughout 2024 based on customer feedback, including additional styles, greater diversity of assets and increased user control over personalization.\nNext, I'd like to go deeper on the transformative power of AI. Last quarter, I talked about the meaningful strides we've taken in establishing eBay as a leader in generative AI for e-commerce. In Q1, we doubled our GPU capacity versus the end of 2023 and which enabled our teams to accelerate our training and fine-tuning of foundational large language models to power a number of eBay features and services. In addition to powering consumer-facing features like Explore, Shop the Look, Magical Listing and Background Enhancement, we're increasingly leveraging generative AI to change how we work, driving meaningful productivity and efficiency improvements across our organization.\nA prime example of this is within our Global Customer Experience organization, or GCX. We are in the midst of a multiyear journey to transform our GCX capabilities using technology. Our north star for customer service is not just to reduce cost, but meaningfully improve the quality of interactions. Recently, we implemented generative AI technology that supports our GCX teammates by analyzing incoming communications to create a simple summary of customers' needs and intent.\nThis technology automatically extracts relevant solutions and next steps from an LLM fine-tuned using our comprehensive knowledge base and policy documents. We are now able to present solutions and a clear and concise structure to our GCX team allowing them to quickly provide customers with the help and support they need, improving the accuracy, consistency and quality of support. With tens of millions of live customer contacts annually, these efficiencies should yield meaningful cost savings for our GCX organization.\nGenerative AI tools are also improving our developer productivity and accelerating our overall tech velocity. Last year, we made GitHub CoPilot available to all of our developers and saw encouraging results. We observed measurable improvements in productivity, along with code acceptance and accuracy. Nearly 3/4 of our developers now use CoPilot every day. In parallel, we began building internal tools to streamline our development processes and improve efficiency. We fine-tuned an open source LLM with eBay's code base and other internal data to develop a proprietary coding assistant that has been incredibly helpful in labor-intensive areas like code migration and software upkeep.\nFor instance, we estimate these tools can reduce the time required for code migration by as much as 20%. We also created an internal GPT specifically for developers that answers thousands of questions per week, serving as a knowledge base for our internal documentation. Overall, we're still early in our generative AI productivity journey, but these are just a few examples of proprietary tools we've introduced to our GCX and technology teams that are already yielding tangible benefits.\nTurning to advertising. Our ads business continued to deliver healthy growth at scale while improving velocity and price realization for our sellers at compelling return on ad spend levels. During Q1, first-party advertising grew 28%, while total ad revenue represented 2.1% of GMV. During the quarter, over 3 million sellers adopted a single ad product and we ended the quarter with over $950 million Live Promoted Listings.\nOur standard cost per acquisition units remain the largest contributor to year-over-year ad revenue growth in Q1, followed by our cost per click advanced product. We are also seeing promising results from some Promoted Listing products in beta. One such product that's continued to gain traction in beta is Offsite Ads. This of eBay solution enables sellers to more actively participate in extending the reach of their listings through CPC ads placed on external services.\nThis product leverages eBay's decades of advertising technology investment on behalf of those sellers, enabling advanced targeting, campaign management and pricing optimization. We expanded our go-to-market efforts for off-site ads towards the end of last year, and this product emerged as a material contributor to first-party ad revenue growth in Q1. We have ambitious road map to further optimize these ad units and increased seller adoption throughout 2024.\nNow let's turn to impact. The eBay community continues to impress us with their generosity. Last quarter, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise more than $46 million, up 18% year-over-year. We also recently published our eighth annual diversity equity and inclusion report. With our purpose of connecting people and building communities to create economic opportunity for all, we know diversity makes us a better and stronger place to work, sell and buy.\nAmong the highlights from our 2023 DE&I report, was the launch of our first-ever inclusion index, which helps us gain a stronger understanding of our employee experience, measure our progress over time and determine how we can better support our employees as a workplace.\nOur Communities of Inclusion our internal eBay resource groups also remained an integral part of what we do. In 2023, our 11 CLIs hosted more than 360 global events, reaching more than 17,000 attendees during the year. And finally, for the eighth year in a row, we've concluded our gender pay equity study, and I'm proud to report our gender pay ratio remained consistent at just over 100% globally.\nIn closing, Q1 marked a strong start to 2024 as we exceeded our financial targets and continue to make progress toward our goal of long-term sustainable GMV growth. focused categories maintained significant momentum despite ongoing macro pressure on discretionary e-commerce. After many quarters of consistent innovation in focused categories like luxury, P&A, refurbished, sneakers and streetwear we are bringing our innovation playbook to preowned fashion in the U.K. to simplify selling, drive inspirational shopping and promote the circular economy.\nOur agreement with collectors would further strengthen our value proposition for hobbyists as we streamline the process of buying, selling, grading and storing trading cards. And we believe our advancements in generative AI are fundamentally changing the customer experience on eBay, increasing productivity across our organization and ultimately driving more value for shareholders. Our momentum and excelling pace of innovation are a testament to the incredible work of our employees who continue to execute our strategic road map and service of our customers.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the second quarter, in context on the full year, before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons, unless I note otherwise.\nWe exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q1 despite an even demand environment in our major markets to start the year. Gross merchandise volume was roughly flat at $18.6 billion. Revenue grew more than 2% to $2.56 billion, outpacing volume by over 2 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%. We delivered $1.25 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 13%. And we returned $638 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial performance during the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.6 billion was roughly flat year-over-year, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of nearly 1 point to reported GMV growth. Our teams did a tremendous job executing on our strategy across focus categories, country-specific investments and horizontal initiatives. Our Q1 volume also benefited from an extra day in the quarter due to the leap year. However, we continue to navigate through a tough environment to discretionary e-commerce, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, 2 of our largest markets.\nFocused categories GMV grew by nearly 5% in aggregate of roughly 6 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during the quarter. This continued momentum was driven by positive volume growth in P&A, refurbished collectibles and luxury goods reflecting the breadth and resilience of our focused categories.\nNext, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was nearly flat in Q1. As Jamie mentioned, P&A was the largest contributor to growth among focused categories despite the slow start in January caused by severe weather conditions in the U.S. These headwinds slightly offset the solid performance in trading cards whereas we've seen improving volume trends in recent quarters, which disproportionately benefit our U.S. business.\nInternational GMV grew nearly 1% on an FX-neutral basis. and increased by nearly 3% as reported due to FX tailwinds. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of our Germany C2C initiative and overall growth in the region. I am pleased that Germany C2C volume growth remain positive even as we began to lap the rollout of these changes in March of last year.\nIn the U.K., we did see some softness in C2C volumes during the quarter. On a new U.K. digital sales reporting requirements came into effect. We are currently working to educate sellers that many of them actually do not incur taxes for selling pre-owned items. In contrast, our B2C business trends were consistent with recent quarters as we kept pace with our closest market benchmark as reported by the British Retail Consortium.\nMoving on to buyers. Trading 12-month active buyers and enthusiast buyers were both stable sequentially and at approximately $132 million and $16 million, respectively, at the end of Q1. Within the quarter, growth in new and reactivated buyers remained positive year-over-year, while buyer retention improved compared to recent quarters. Despite macro headwinds, spend per active and users buyer, both grew slightly compared to a year ago.\nTurning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.56 billion during Q1 and up over 2%, outpacing volume by over 2 points. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly 60 basis points to reported year-over-year revenue growth. Our take rate in the first quarter was over 13.7%, down less than 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by FX headwinds and which more than offset the seasonal improvement in core take rate in Q1. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate expanded by nearly 10 basis points driven by tailwinds from first-party advertising, eBay international shipping and payments, offset by a 20 basis point headwind from FX.\nTotal advertising revenue grew 20% to $384 million and represented 2.1% penetration of GMV. First-party adds grew 28% to $370 million, nearly 28 points faster than volume. Our legacy third-party display ads remained a headwind to total advertising growth in Q1, with revenue declining 55% to less than $15 million. As discussed in recent quarters, we continue to selectively [ duplicate ] these noncore ads on certain pages to improve the overall user experience, and they now make up less than 4% of total ad revenue.\nShifting to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved by 60 basis points year-over-year as headwinds from eBay international shipping, traffic acquisition costs associated with a ramp of offsite ads and FX were more than offset by lower depreciation expenses and cost of payments efficiencies. As we discussed last quarter, our depreciation expense in 2024 and is impacted by an extension in the accounting useful life of our service and networking equipment, which primarily will be recognized in cost of revenue. Additional information will be available in our 10-Q filing.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 30.3% in Q1, improving 70 basis points year-over-year and 360 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our operating margins benefited from our workforce reduction in January, the aforementioned accounting change, cost of payment efficiencies and our structural cost program. This leverage was partly offset by a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 70 basis points and reinvestments into sales and marketing to support our full funnel initiatives.\nWe grew non-GAAP earnings per share by nearly 13% to $1.25 in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share was $0.85 in Q1. The difference was primarily due to stock-based compensation and a reduction in the value of our equity investment portfolio, largely due to FX movements.\nNext, I'll discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow was $472 million in Q1, down year-over-year due to the timing of working capital items. We ended the first quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $4.9 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased $499 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $51 during Q1 and had $2.9 billion remaining under our buyback authorization at the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $139 million in March or $0.27 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned $6.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 134% of cumulative free cash flow over that period.\nNow I'll give an update on our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q1. Our Adevinta stake was valued at over $4 billion down over $200 million quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to FX movements. On April 24, the consortium led by Permira and Blackstone sees its final regulatory clearance regarding the offer to acquire Adevinta. We expect this transaction to close on May 29, subject to closing conditions. While changes in FX rates impact the value of our stake for quarterly reporting purposes, they do not impact the cash proceeds we expect from the pending deal. Our Adyen warrants were valued at over $500 million at the end of Q1. Our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions including adding share price and the probability of vesting.\nTurning to our outlook. Our strategy and execution are driving underlying growth in our business. However, the macro environment remains challenging and dynamic. Balancing these factors, we forecast Q2 GMV between $17.8 million and $18.2 billion, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 2% and flat year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent roughly 0.5 point of headwind to Q2 GMV growth year-over-year and roughly 1 point of headwind quarter-over-quarter.\nWe expect to generate revenue between $2.49 billion and $2.54 billion in Q2, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 1% year-over-year. Our forecast implies revenue will outpace volume by close to 1 point on an FX-neutral basis. We estimate FX will represent more than a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth in Q2. We expect first-party ad revenue growth to decelerate to low double digits year-over-year in Q2 due to lapping and onetime factors.\nAs we discussed last year, a deferral release to CPC ads put forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue into Q2 of 2023. In addition, benefits from our [ halo ] attribution change in Q2 of last year, but to extraordinary growth in first-party advertising overall which will create more challenging year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of this year. However, we do expect a recovery in advertising growth during the second half of 2024 driven by continued adoption and optimization of our first-party ad products.\nWe forecast Q2 non-GAAP operating margin between 26.9% and 27.6% and of 35 basis points of year-over-year improvement at the midpoint. This is consistent with historical seasonality, where Q1 is usually the high point for operating margin, followed by a sequential decline in Q2. And reflecting both the seasonal decrease in volumes and the ramp-up in product and full fund and marketing investments. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.10 and and $1.15 in the second quarter, representing non-GAAP EPS growth between 6% and 11% year-over-year. Based on current rates, FX would represent a headwind of roughly 2.5 percentage points.\nMoving to the full year. We continue to plan our business assuming no fundamental change in the macro environment this year. Within this context, we expect our FX-neutral GMV to turn positive in Q3 or Q4. We expect revenue to outpace GMV growth by approximately 2 points for the full year on an FX-neutral basis. In addition, FX represents close to a 1 point expected headwind to total spot revenue growth. We maintain our outlook for non-GAAP operating margin to expand by 60 to 100 basis points for the full year.\nWhere we land in this range could vary based on investment opportunities we see throughout the year, not necessarily our volume trends alone. At current rates, we continue to expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of roughly 50 basis points to operating margins, which is mostly offset by an expected tailwind of 40 basis points primarily driven by the change in accounting estimate associated with the extension of the useful life of server and networking of equipment.\nFor the full year, we project capital expenditures to be between 4% and 5% of revenue, in line with our historical average. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We expect just under $2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 with the majority generated in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our free cash flow has been temporarily pressured in recent years, by scheduled repatriation payments and changes to the tax treatment of R&D expenses, which will largely alleviate after 2025.\nFrom a timing perspective, our federal cash tax payments will revert to a normal schedule this year with our largest outlay occuring in Q2, leading to a more normalized cadence of free cash flow. From a capital allocation standpoint, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for Q2 to be paid in June. For the full year, we are targeting share repurchases of just over $2 billion. Given our better-than-expected Q1 results and our confidence in our strategy and execution, we are increasing our forecast for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to 9% to 11% year-over-year in 2024.\nIn closing, Q1 was a strong quarter for eBay as we exceeded our outlook across our key financial metrics. Our results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid persistent challenges in the global economy. We remain on track to achieve positive GMV growth this year in Q3 or Q4, driven by our accelerating pace of innovation across focus categories and [indiscernible] initiatives. In addition, we are laser-focused on further improving our cost discipline and efficiency and expect operating margin expansion this year, even as we make incremental investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth. As a result, we plan to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year at the midpoint of our guidance and exceed our original 3-year target for total capital returns.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we made in 2023 against our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts and our goal of returning eBay to long-term sustainable growth. Let's go over a few highlights from the full year.\nFirst, despite significant macro pressure on discretionary spending across our major markets, we saw organic year-over-year GMV growth improved during each quarter of 2023, resulting in GMV growth down roughly 1% for the full year. Focus category GMV grew by nearly 4%, outpacing the remainder of our business by roughly 7 points, and we exited 2023 at approaching 30% penetration. We stabilized our active and enthusiast fire counts as acquisition, reactivation and retention improved year-over-year.\nOur revenue grew 3% organically to over $10 billion. driven by continued momentum in first-party advertising, expansion of our financial services offerings and the launch of eBay International Shipping. And we made significant investments in tech talent and marketing to support our strategic pillars, including making meaningful strides towards establishing eBay as a leader in generative AI for e-commerce. These results have demonstrated that we have the right strategy which has put us on a path to building a stronger, more resilient company.\nIn service of that goal, last month, we announced significant organizational changes focused on removing layers and simplifying execution in order to better meet the needs of our customers. This involved the difficult but necessary decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 1,000 roles and begin to scale back our alternative workforce contracts. This restructuring better aligns our expenses with the growth of our business and I'm confident it will enable us to accelerate innovation while delivering long-term value for shareholders.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter. We generated $18.6 billion of gross merchandise volume in Q4, nearly flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 3% to $2.6 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, and we delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share resounding in $4.24 of EPS for the full year. Our focused category strategy remained a significant driver of underlying growth during Q4. We focused category GMV outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 6 points, growing roughly 4% for the third straight quarter. Our momentum in Motors Parts & Accessories, or P&A, continued in the quarter, as volume growth held steady in the mid-single digits.\nOur eBay Guaranteed Fit programs have benefited buyer trust and retention across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, driving incremental GMV within P&A last year. During Q3, we began rolling out multi-warehouse shipping optimization to some of our largest U.S. P&A sellers that collectively manage millions of listings. B2C sellers can activate these tools via eBay APIs, and this enables buyers to see more accurate estimated delivery dates when purchasing from sellers with multiple warehouses, which has driven a measurable uplift in conversion for early adopters.\nIn 2024, we plan to onboard sellers in other categories to utilize this technology and tighten delivery estimates across eBay more broadly. Our established position in P&A has led to more than 100 million vehicles being saved in the My Garage section of eBay by active customers. In addition to providing better fitment experiences, we are finding more ways to leverage this valuable data to drive utility for our customers. For example, last quarter, we introduced predictive maintenance that offers AI-driven auto part recommendations based on a vehicle's mileage. Features like this help eBay stay top of mind for customers looking for auto parts at a great value.\nThe work we've done in the eBay Authenticity Guarantee program has also been a key driver of our focused category momentum and raising the level of trust on the marketplace. In Q4, we launched our eighth authentication center in Tokyo, Japan, our first center focused primarily on cross-border trade. Our Tokyo center is currently authenticating luxury handbags and will expand to other highest categories over time. Japan is one of the largest and fastest-growing market for personal luxury goods in the world, enabling our global buyers to tap into a wealth of inventory from the world's most exclusive brands with complete confidence.\nEarlier this month, we also expanded the Authenticity Guarantee program to cover loose gemstones. This further extends our product coverage within fine jewelry with authentication from our existing partner, the Gemological Institute of America, a trusted authority for over 9 decades. In addition to expanding focus categories, last year, we made a significant investment in Germany, our third largest country as measured by demand. We adopted a similar approach to our vertical playbook to address the unique needs of German consumers. These changes included language enhancements and improvements to search, SEO and recommendations, shipping and return label improvements and a complete overhaul of the local pickup experience.\nIn January, we further improved local discovery in Germany by introducing a new MAP-based browsing experience, which services trending and recently listed items through an intuitive interface based on what's nearby and easy to pick up. Overall, our initiative in Germany has outperformed our initial expectations. We've observed C2C seller NPS and customer satisfaction both up 20 points or more versus our previous baselines. Our buyer NPS also increased by double digits as buyers who sell returned to positive growth following the initiative launch.\nIn addition, enhancements made to our QR code technology has helped reduce unpaid items by more than 50% for local pickups. And importantly, C2C volume in Germany returned to positive growth resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV relative to our prior trajectory. These investments have made our business significantly more resilient to the challenging macro environment in Germany where overall e-commerce growth has been negative in recent quarters.\nDuring 2023, we also laid the groundwork to accelerate our capabilities in artificial intelligence and further embed AI throughout the customer experience and our organization. After the first commercial large language models became available from companies like Open AI and others last year, we immediately found ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve the eBay experience across selling, buying, advertising and marketing. Within a few months, we began fine-tuning open-source LLMs using eBay's proprietary commerce data on our own infrastructure.\nThese models include a smaller number of parameters and thus operated faster and more cost efficiently than commercial LLM when operating at scale. But we also found these fine-tuned LLM could perform as well or in some cases, better than commercial LLM across certain dimensions and use cases, such as generating listing descriptions. To support an even more ambitious AI road map for 2024, by the end of Q1, we expect to have doubled our GPU capacity versus the end of last year.\nImportantly, this investment falls within our historical CapEx budget range of 4% to 5% of revenue. This added GPU capacity, combined with our existing infrastructure, allows us to develop LLMs from scratch pre-trained using eBay's nearly 3 decades worth of e-commerce data. While we'll continue to take a hybrid approach, leveraging both commercial and open-source LMs, we expect more generative AI services to be powered by internal LLM in 2024, helping make buying and selling on eBay simpler, faster and more magical.\nIn terms of customer-facing features, we continue to iterate on our magical listing experience that has already been used by millions of sellers, which we believe makes it 1 of the most widely used Gen AI features in e-commerce to date. Generative AI descriptions have rolled out to 100% of users in our top 5 markets. Adoption trends remain healthy. Customer satisfaction continues to be at high levels as we've expanded outside of English-speaking countries and content acceptance rates remain above 90% through the full rollout. The next phase of our magical listing experience is currently being tested by up to 5% of C2C sellers on an opt-in basis. This experience is even more seamless as it leverages our image recognition technology and generative AI to prefill or suggest product titles, categories and other item aspects using photos alone.\nWe are excited to make this experience available to for sellers in Q1 as early feedback from beta users has been incredibly encouraging. I'm also pleased to see the potential benefits our AI tools can have on the billions of listing images across our marketplace as high-quality products photos can have a significant impact on conversion on eBay. Last quarter, we completed the global rollout of our revamped background removal tool in our listing flows, which leverages AI to effortlessly remove background noise from their product images. This tool has enabled sellers to create cleaner, more professional product images and it has received rave reviews from our customers.\nBuilding on top of this, we're now leveraging generative AI to make sellers product images even more compelling using our new background swap tool. This feature allows sellers to show their products alongside a wide variety of AI-generated backgrounds. For example, you could display a pair of Air Jordan sneakers on a hardwood basketball court or showcase your preowned hiking boots a top of Pictures Mountain Summit. We are currently testing this feature in beta with 1% of sellers on iOS devices, and I'm excited to see more sellers leveraging these tools to enhance their product images and drive conversion.\nNow turning to our advertising business, which delivered another strong quarter. Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $393 million, while first-party ads outpaced volume by 30 points. For the full year, we generated over $1.4 billion of total advertising revenue, up roughly 25% for the year and more than double our ad revenue in 2019. The over 2.9 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q4, and we currently have over 900 million live promoted listings. Our standard cost per acquisition product remained the largest contributor to year-over-year adds growth in Q4. But notably, Promoted Listings advanced, our cost per click unit was the largest contributor to sequential advertising growth.\nOur CPC revenue and overall advertiser count benefited from the launch of rule-based campaigns in Q4, which allows sellers to automatically promote new listings based on rules that set for inclusion, such as price range, category, brand or condition. Additionally, during Q4, we launched a top [ Pix Carousel ] for search. which provides a curated set of promoted listings ads comprised of hyper-relevant top-selling items from our highest ranked sellers. Thus far, buyer has been highly engaged with these ads providing added velocity for our sellers.\nNext, I'd like to share a few milestones around our sustainability efforts last year, starting with eCommerce. eCommerce continues to provide significant value for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times. In 2023, our marketplace generated nearly $4.9 billion in positive economic impact due to sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity helped avoid approximately 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions that would typically be used in producing new goods and kept nearly 70,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills.\nAdditionally, eBay remains committed to enabling more green energy on the U.S. electricity grid. As part of these ambitions, we have entered into agreements for 3 offsite renewable energy projects over the past 4 years. Our portion of the latest project is now fully operational, and the green energy produced will be roughly equivalent to the annual energy usage at our data center in Salt Lake City. Combined with our other 2 projects, this green energy covers over 40% of our global electricity consumption. And I'm incredibly proud that we source over 90% of our energy consumption for eBay controlled offices and data centers from renewable sources overall, and we remain on track to reaching our 100% renewable target by 2025.\nNow let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise more than $43 million in Q4 and nearly $162 million for the full year. The eBAY Foundation granted more than $19 million in 2023 to support historically excluded entrepreneurs and through our employee gift-matching program. I'm honored to be a purpose-driven company that supports communities around the world.\nFor the fifth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. eBay was also included once again in Just Capital and CNBC's list of America's most just companies which measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their incredible work and bringing our strategy to life and their tireless support in our community worldwide amid ongoing challenges in the global economy.\nIn closing, while we continue to navigate a dynamic operating environment, I'm incredibly optimistic about our road map for 2024. Our teams are better organized for speed, allowing us to be nimble and make critical decisions more quickly. The foundational AI capabilities we developed last year make us well positioned to unlock the power of our data assets, fundamentally change the customer experience on eBay, and drive efficiency across the company in 2024.\nWe will continue to invest in new and existing focus categories while also improving country-specific experiences like we did in Germany last year. We expect continued momentum in first-party advertising, despite lapping outstanding growth in the prior year, while we grow our financial service offerings for customers. And from a financial standpoint, we are in a strong position to expand margins, drive robust earnings growth and deliver healthy capital returns to shareholders in 2024, while still investing in high ROI initiatives to keep us on the path towards sustainable GMV growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and the full year and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise.\nI'm pleased that we met or exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q4 despite observing a softer demand environment during the early part of the quarter. Gross merchandise volume was nearly flat at $18.6 billion. Revenue grew 3% to nearly $2.6 billion, outpacing volume by over 3 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we returned $379 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.6 billion was nearly flat year-over-year, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of up 2 points to reported GMV growth. As we discussed last quarter, we observed softer demand for discretionary goods during the beginning of Q4 as consumers deal with elevated inflation from higher interest rates in our key markets. Shoppers were more discerning in their purchase behavior as we approach the holidays and the promotional environment adapted to meet their expectations.\nHowever, we start to see our business improve towards the end of November, particularly in the U.S., driven by consumers looking for value to stretch their limited holiday budgets. Additionally, we believe recent product improvements modestly benefited our participation in last minute holiday shopping. These include an improved accuracy of our estimated delivery dates and product changes we made in Q4 to better highlight listings with faster shipping times.\nFocused categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly 6 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during the quarter. P&A Refurbished and Luxury with the top 3 contributors to GMV growth in focused categories. P&A delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit GMV growth as improved trust from programs like [ Guaranteed Fit ] growing shipment coverage continue to benefit the overall customer experience.\nNext, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was nearly flat in Q4, an improvement of 1 point sequentially. The U.S. consumer demand was notably more resilient relative to our largest international markets, consistent with market benchmarks. The underlying growth was even stronger when we include U.S. buyer spending on cross-border goods. International GMV was down nearly 1% on an FX-neutral basis and up 4% as reported due to FX tailwinds.\nWhile we saw resilient demand in the U.K. and Germany over the holidays e-commerce market growth in these countries remain challenged. The progress we made in Germany to improve the sale and bio experiences, particularly within C2C, help mitigate a tough environment where e-commerce growth has been persistently negative. In the U.K., our GMV growth narrowed the gap to market as consumers continue to look for value during the holidays. We also benefited from the lapping of the Royal Mail strikes that impacted results in Q4 of 2022.\nMoving to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers were $132 million at the end of last year. Continuing the trend of stabilization in 2023 after a period of post-COVID rationalization in recent years. Enthusiastic buyers remained approximately 16 million. Spend currency set was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually despite continued pressure on discretionary spending across our major geographies.\nTurning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.6 billion during the fourth quarter, up 3%, outpacing volume by over 3 points. Foreign exchange was a headwind of over 1 point to reported year-over-year revenue growth. Our take rate in Q4 was approximately 13.8%, down roughly 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonal category and product mix. partly offset by continued momentum in our advertising business and a modest tailwind from FX. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate was roughly flat despite nearly 0.5 point of FX headwind.\nTotal advertising revenue grew 20% to $393 million and reached 2.1% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew 30% and to $368 million or 30 points faster than volume. As Jamie discussed earlier, we saw a robust seller adoption of Promoted Listings advanced in Q4, driven by recent innovations like smart targeting on role-based campaigns.\nMoving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7% during the quarter, improving 30 basis points sequentially and down roughly 3 points year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a headwind to margins of approximately 150 basis points in Q4 compared to a year ago. The remainder is largely attributable to continued investment in product development and the margin impact of recent M&A. As expected, eBay international shipping was no longer a drag on our operating margins in Q4. But this program weighed modestly on gross margins year-over-year. as its cost primarily fall within cost of revenue.\nOverall gross margin was down about 60 basis points year-over-year as modest headwinds from EIS were partly offset by efficiencies in cost of payments. Within G&A expense, we recognized a GAAP restructuring charge of $99 million in Q4 relating to our recent organizational changes as well as the GAAP accrual of $15 million related to pending legal matters. You will find more information on adjustments in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix of our earnings presentation. While additional details on the legal matters, will be provided in our upcoming 10-K. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.07 in Q4, roughly flat year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share was $1.40 for the quarter, driven by unrealized gains in our equity investment portfolio. These gains were partly offset by stock-based compensation on the aforementioned GAAP restructuring charge.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow was negative $3 million in Q4, consistent with our guidance for de minimis free cash flow is California's disaster tax relief program for 2023, delayed the majority of our annual cash tax payments until October. We ended the year with cash and nonequity investments of $5.1 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased $250 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $41 during Q4, and had $1.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of the quarter. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $129 million in December or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 134% and cumulative free cash flow over that period.\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q4. Our adventure stake was valued at nearly $4.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion versus Q3. On November 21, a consortium led by [ Chimera ] and Blackstone and that's an offer to acquire [ Adevinta ]. This offer is proceeding as expected, and we continue to expect it to close in Q2. The public offer period expired on February 9 with 95% of shareholders accepting the offer which satisfies the requirement of at least 90% acceptance rate. We understand that the consortium is working expeditiously to achieve the remaining regulatory approvals and closes. Our Adyen warrants were valued at over $360 million at the end of Q4. Our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including adding share price and the probability of vesting.\nMoving to our outlook. We have started the year with relatively uneven demand across our major markets, with the U.K. [indiscernible] with GDP growth and U.S. retail sales weaker than expected in January. The dynamic nature of the operating environment has been incorporated into our GMV outlook as well as a 1 point boost to GMV growth from the extra leap year day. For the first quarter, we expect between $18.2 million and $18.5 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline of 2% to flat year-over-year or spot GMV decline of 1% or flat. We expect to generate revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.54 billion in Q1, representing FX-neutral growth between flat and 2% and year-over-year.\nOur forecast implies revenue will outpace volume by over 2 points on an FX-neutral basis, while FX represents close to a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. We forecast Q1 non-GAAP operating margin between 29.6% and 30%, marking both a sequential and year-over-year improvement at the midpoint. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.19 and $1.23 in the first quarter, representing EPS growth between 7% and 11% year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent a 2-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q1.\nNow let me share some thoughts on the full year. Assuming no fundamental change in the macroeconomic environment this year, we expect our FX neutral GMV growth rate to turn positive in Q3 or Q4 of this year. We expect revenue to outpace GMV growth by about 2 points on an FX-neutral basis. We expect FX to represent close to a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. We anticipate our take rate expansion to be primarily driven by continued healthy growth in advertising revenue throughout 2024, although we do face elevated year-over-year comps starting in the second quarter, due to our acceleration in 2023, along with continued secular headwinds within our third-party ads.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by 60 to 100 basis points for the full year. as we balance continued investments in tech, talent and marketing with organizational efficiencies, productivity gains and savings from our ongoing structural cost program. Our non-GAAP operating margin outlook includes a net benefit of approximately 40 basis points year-over-year, which is primarily driven by a change in accounting estimate associated to the extension of the useful life of data center equipment.\nFollowing an assessment of our servers and networking equipment in December, we determined it was appropriate to extend the accounting use for life from 3 years to 4 years. You can find more information on this policy change in our 10-K filing. Offsetting this benefit is an operating margin headwind of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year due to foreign exchange as we lapped sizable FX hedging gains in 2023. This is on top of the approximately 30 basis point year-over-year operating margin headwind we experienced in 2023 as we lap the more meaningful hedging gains in 2022.\nOur capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be stable between 4% and 5% of revenue, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%. We expect just under $2 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which contemplates headwinds of $99 million in restructuring charges and $234 million from repatriation tax payments. As a reminder, these repatriation tax payments will remain a temporary headwind to free cash flow through 2025, which is the final year of an 8-year repayment schedule. Details on these tax payments are in the appendix section of our earnings presentation.\nFor Q1, we have raised our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.27 per share to be paid out in March. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board recently increased our share purchase authorization by $2 billion, bringing our total remaining authorization to approximately $3.4 billion. We are targeting at least $2 billion of share repurchases for the year, though the pacing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect to end 2024 with cumulative repurchases and dividends representing approximately 130% of free cash flow since the beginning of 2022, above our original target of 125% for the period. Given our top line assumptions, margin outlook and healthy capital return expectations. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% year-over-year in 2024.\nIn closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's execution during 2023. Despite a very challenging macro environment, we saw underlying momentum in our business as GMV trends improved gradually through the year and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.24, up 3% for the full year. While we are planning our business around the assumption that the macro environment will continue to be challenging, we remain incredibly confident in our strategy and our plan for 2024.\nAssuming no further degradation in the environment, we expect our investments in focused categories, local market and C2C initiatives, generative AI and other site line improvements to turn GMV growth positive in Q3 or Q4 of this year. Although we will continue to invest in our strategic pillars, we are committed to striking the right balance between expenses and revenue growth and continue to lean into cost efficiencies to drive 60 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2024.\nOur fortress balance sheet enabled us to increase our buybacks and dividends this year, leading to total capital return to shareholders of approximately 130% of cumulative free cash flow from 2022 to 2024. And I'm extremely pleased this financial plan allows us to target non-GAAP EPS growth of between 8% to 10% year-over-year demonstrating the earnings part of our business.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid results during the third quarter. We generated gross merchandise volume of approximately $18 billion, while revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 3%, while returning over $780 million of capital to shareholders. We achieved these results despite continued challenges in the global macro environment. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and pressure demand for discretionary goods.\nAs Steve will discuss in greater detail, we've observed softening consumer trends to date in Q4 and particular challenges in Europe, suggesting we may see a more muted seasonal uptick over the holidays. We are focused on controlling what we can control, being prudent about our costs, leaning in operational efficiencies and continuing to drive innovation for our customers.\nLast quarter, I discussed our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts, which is focused on 3 strategic pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. And I'm pleased that we made meaningful progress against each of these pillars during Q3, which I'll discuss in greater detail.\nI'll start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. Our relevant and focus categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business, and we've observed a meaningful improvement in our growth relative to the market in every category we've invested to date. Focus categories grew roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace in Q3. Year-to-date, our focus categories have grown at approximately 4% year-over-year.\nFor context, we estimate market rates of growth in those same categories were in the low single digits on average during the first half of 2023 as several of these categories are comprised of highly discretionary goods, which have been more acutely impacted by a challenging macro environment.\nWe continue to push the envelope of innovation in motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, by developing features that enhance our customer value proposition. These investments have fueled mid-single-digit GMV growth for P&A for 3 consecutive quarters, which is in line with industry growth for this segment of e-commerce in our largest markets.\nThe eBay Guaranteed Fit program has contributed to this momentum by delivering a game-changing level of trust. This program enables tens of millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back, which has yielded a measurable uplift in conversion.\nAdditionally, we have not observed a material impact on product returns as our fitment have reduced the likelihood of buyers receiving a part that does not fit their vehicle. Given the success this program has had in the U.S., we were incredibly excited to roll out similar programs in the U.K. and Germany during Q3, where our unaided awareness among P&A shoppers is significantly higher than it is in the U.S.\nThe Guarantee Fit program is underpinned by multiple years of investment in P&A technology, including our acquisition of myFitment. We have been steadily onboarding sellers into the fitment toolkit to enhance their P&A listings with more robust fitment data, which improves findability for parts and protects buyers from unnecessary returns.\nBy the end of Q3, roughly 2/3 of large U.S. P&A sellers have adopted the toolkit. On average, sellers are observing conversion uplift of double digits or higher for listings enhanced by this toolkit, driving incremental GMV for eBay.\nIn early October, we reached a major milestone with 2 billion pieces of fitment data added to live listings using myFitment's technology. While this is outstanding progress, we continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding process, making it faster to import listings and identifying more vehicle matches for our more than 550 million live P&A listings.\nDuring Q3, we continued to deliver relevant experiences for the collectibles category across a number of areas. We generated over $10 billion in GMV from collectibles over the last 12 months, and more than 1 in 4 eBay buyers purchased at least 1 collectibles item over the past year. These buyers carry some of the highest conversion, repurchase and retention rates on eBay. And they are also among the heaviest cross-category shoppers on our platform, which supports our other categories.\nOur goal is to remain the world's most loved destination for passionate collectibles enthusiasts, providing access to the most compelling assortment of inventory across multiple categories in a high-trust environment.\nIn service of that vision, during Q3, we launched direct submissions to the eBay Vault. This enables any U.S. resident to send in trading cards valued at $250 or higher from their personal collections to the Vault, even if they were not purchased on eBay.\nIn July to coincide with the National Sports Collectors Convention the industry's biggest event, we announced Vault Enhanced submission, which now enables us to gather large amounts of high-ASP cards in person at tentpole events attended by top collectors. During one weekend at the National Loan, we added tens of millions of dollars of assets under management at eBay Vault, including a signed Jackie Robinson card valued at approximately $1 million.\nDuring Q3, we also wrote out a revamped condition grading system for trading cards, which greatly improves transparency for collectibles in this category. New listings now carry more precise details, including whether a card has been professionally graded and the numerical grade or 1 of several predefined card conditions. Existing listings will be also migrated to the new standard over the coming months. Sellers have been asking us for this feature for some time, and we believe it will drive improved trust for buyers, better and more consistent price realization for sellers as well as more robust data and insights around individual card values for eBay.\nIn response to our growing community of collectors and enthusiasts, last year, we introduced eBay Live, an interactive live shopping experience within the eBay app. This feature marries eBay's unique scale with an engaging shopping experience that we believe enthusiasts across the collectibles, luxury and fashion categories are increasingly seeking. Buyers can interact with influential sellers and check out in real time without leaving the stream. And sellers have loved this tool as they can move items at scale and increase their sales velocity while listing items as fixed price or as extended auctions. eBay Live is currently in beta, but we continue to expand its availability to more sellers and categories.\nWhile we've been thoughtful about the pace of onboarding as we fine-tune the beta experience, Q3 market inflection point as we hosted over 1,000 live events saw [ our million fire ] tune in and grew GMV from eBay Live by 4x quarter-over-quarter.\nNow let me turn to the second pillar of our evolved strategy, scalable solutions. We're pleased with the progress we're making with our eBay International Shipping program, or EIS, which makes cross-border trade more seamless and cost-effective for sellers and buyers. We continued to scale EIS during Q3 and now have over 400 million live listings from U.S. sellers shippable to international buyers in more than 190 countries.\nSellers have had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the new program with customer satisfaction rates approximately 30 points higher than the previous global shipping program it replaced. In October, we launched combined shipping for EIS, which allows buyers to order multiple items from an international seller and pay one consolidated shipping fee.\nQ3 also marked another strong quarter for our advertising business. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million. First-party ads grew 36% to $345 million or 36 points faster than FX-neutral GMV growth. Over 2.3 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q3, and we currently have over 850 million live Promoted Listings.\nPromoted Listing Standard, our cost per acquisition ad unit, was once again the largest contributor to growth in Q3 driven by continued optimization of placements, ad rate improvements and the recurring benefit of the Halo attribution change we discussed last quarter.\nPromoted Listings Advanced, our cost-per-click product, was the fastest-growing product in our ads portfolio on a year-over-year basis. PL Advanced continues to benefit from the simplifying and automating of core elements of the campaign setup and management processes.\nIn September, we launched smart targeting for PL Advanced, which makes creating and managing CPC campaigns easier than ever. Previously, these campaigns took a lot of time to set up and manage as sellers have to manually set keywords and manage campaigns individually. Now through smart targeting, eBay uses AI to manage keywords on behalf of sellers and optimize campaigns dynamically, all with just a few clicks to set up. As part of the smart targeting launch, we've also extended CPC ads to the similar items recommendations module when users are viewing another item, using fully automated targeting and bidding technology.\nMoving to our third pillar, magical innovations. Last quarter, we discussed our magical listing experience, which represents the biggest transformation of the eBay listing process in our 28-year history. For over 2 decades, 2 of our biggest focuses were at odds with each other: making it a simple and fast as possible to list an item and ensuring listings are rich and comprehensive to maximize sales.\nNow generative AI allows us to leverage our treasure trove of images and listing data to quickly create compelling listings. Early users have told us these capabilities will unlock more of the inventory in their closets and garages, which could ultimately keep more products out of landfills.\nThe first phase of our magical listing experience leverages generative AI to instantly populate the item description within the listing flow based on a product's title, category and other aspects. This feature rolled out to 100% of mobile app users in the U.S., U.K. and Germany during Q3.\nIn October, we extended the generative AI descriptions to 50% of desktop users in these countries. The first phase of the magical listing experience has been incredibly well received by sellers as usage, adoption, customer satisfaction and content acceptance rates have all been higher than expected.\nAs much as sellers have enjoyed the first phase of magical listing, we believe the next iteration will be so simple and easy to use that all of our sellers will love it. This experience will enable sellers to point their camera at an item, take a photo, and eBay does the rest. Behind the scenes, we have powered this experience with our proprietary computer vision technology and generative AI to seamlessly populate the description, category and any other item aspects.\nOur camera-based magical listing experience has been in employee beta for several months and is currently in a limited beta with a number of large sellers. Feedback from our beta sellers has been extremely positive as they found the new experience intuitive and easier to use. We are incredibly excited to bring this experience to more sellers over the coming months.\nAs part of our magical listing initiative, we also rolled out a vastly improved background removal tool powered by AI during Q3. Sellers have told us that simpler, cleaner images of their products have a significant impact on conversion. Our enhanced tool has now rolled out to all users in the core listing flow, and sellers have told us they are already noticing significant quality and performance improvements from the revamped tool versus our prior version.\nOverall, I'm incredibly pleased by the progress we are making across all 3 pillars of our strategy. It is particularly encouraging to see how recent advancements in AI and machine learning can help us address more long-standing pain points for sellers and buyers on eBay in efficient and scalable ways.\nNext, I'd like to highlight the impact we're having on the communities we serve. In Q3, we released our second annual small business report, which examines the sentiment of our global sellers. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, eBay sellers are confident they can build their businesses and give back to their communities. In fact, more than half of eBay sellers expect their overall business to grow in the next 12 months, and over 2/3 expect their businesses on eBay to increase over the next 5 years.\nWe also recently announced the winners of our up-and-running grants. This program is currently in its fourth year and provides entrepreneurs with capital to invest in their businesses, along with training and mentorship to help them grow and thrive.\nThe third quarter also marked the 20th anniversary of eBay for Charity, a program created as a way for people to give back during times of crisis. It has evolved to a global platform supporting countless organizations and causes and raised more than $1.3 billion for nonprofits to date. In Q3 alone, the eBay community raised $40 million, up 16% year-over-year.\nAll of these efforts demonstrate our purpose-driven community, and we are honored to be recognized for our progress. We're proud to be ranked on the U.S. News & World Report's inaugural list of Best Companies to Work For. eBay was also recognized as a top corporate philanthropist by the Silicon Valley Business Journal and San Francisco Business Times.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our extraordinary eBay team for delivering another solid quarter and continuing to innovate for our customers. We made significant progress against our long-term objectives during Q3. Our accelerating pace of innovation is fundamentally changing the eBay experience, driving higher customer satisfaction and paving the way for new growth and revenue opportunities.\nAs the macro environment remains uncertain, we'll be balanced in how we invest in the future, prioritizing our highest-ROI investments in order to generate long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights on the third quarter on Slide 11 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise.\nQ3 was another solid quarter for eBay as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics despite ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to approximately $18 billion. Revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion, outpacing volume by 5 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%. We delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we generated $777 million of free cash flow while returning $783 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% organically to approximately $18 billion or roughly flat year-over-year on a total FX-neutral basis. Foreign exchange represented a nearly 2-point tailwind to reported GMV growth. However, the U.S. dollar appreciation during the quarter created a GMV headwind of more than $100 million versus rates implied in our Q3 outlook.\nFocus categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace. P&A was once again the largest contributor to growth and maintained mid-single-digit GMV growth for the third straight quarter, in line with market rate of growth for this segment of e-commerce.\neBay Refurbished was the fastest-growing focus category on a percentage basis, while GMV growth in our luxury focus categories was positive for the third straight quarter as our combination of value and quality has served customers well in the current economic environment.\nNext, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 2% organically in Q3, an improvement of over 2 points sequentially. On a total FX-neutral basis, U.S. GMV was down 1%. Although the U.S. economy has been more resilient than our other markets, demand for discretionary goods continues to be impacted by the cumulative burden of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates observed in over a decade. U.S. consumers are increasingly seeking value, which has shifted some demand to inventory offered by our CBT sellers.\nInternational GMV was roughly flat on an FX-neutral basis and up nearly 4% as reported. Our international markets continue to experience more severe macroeconomic pressure than the U.S. with the U.K. seeing consistently negative e-commerce growth since early 2022, while Germany has now faced multiple quarters of economic contraction. This pressure has been mitigated by continued strength in cross-border trade, which offset far weaker trends in Europe.\nMoving to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers was stable quarter-over-quarter at 132 million. On an organic basis, active buyers remained at approximately 131 million for the third straight quarter. Confused spite also flat sequentially at 16 million. Spend points was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually but modestly year-over-year.\nTurning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.5 billion during the third quarter, up 4% organically, outpacing volume by 5 points. Total FX-neutral revenue growth inclusive of M&A was 5%, while currency had a de minimis impact to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9%, down modestly quarter-over-quarter but up nearly 50 basis points year-over-year. The combination of FX and the ad revenue recognition change in Q2 represented a sequential take rate headwind of over 10 basis points in Q3.\nAdvertising was again the largest tailwind to our take rate on a year-over-year basis and also quarter-over-quarter after adjusting for the Q2 accounting change. eBay International Shipping and recent M&A in aggregate added 5 basis points to our take rate sequentially. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million and reached just over 2% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew 36% to $345 million or roughly 36 points faster than FX-neutral volume.\nAs noted last quarter, the revenue deferral release for CPC ads in Q2 created a sequential headwind of $9 million for first-party ad revenue growth in Q3. While we are pleased with the continued robust growth in Promoted Listings, year-over-year growth decelerated slightly as we lack the notable acceleration during the prior year period, which was driven by a series of performance optimizations.\nOur legacy third-party display ads, which have been impacted by a combination of secular and macro headwinds in recent quarters, decelerated further during Q3. In recent months, we have actively deprecated third-party ads in certain circumstances to improve the user experience. First-party ads remain our primary focus as we continue to invest in scaling, optimizing and automating our Promoted Listings portfolio.\nFinancial services had a modestly positive impact on our take rate sequentially as our in-house payments capabilities have advanced in recent quarters. We have identified more opportunities for GMV, revenue and cost optimization. Adyen continues to be an incredibly strategic partner for us in financial services. During Q3, we expanded our usage of Adyen's merchant acquiring services to cover additional forms of payment. This development has positive implications for our Adyen model probability, which I will discuss shortly.\nMoving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4% during the quarter, down roughly 2.5 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.1 points of this delta was driven by the combination of recent M&A and the eBay International Shipping program. Foreign exchange also represents a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points. The remainder of the margin variance was driven by investments in our business and modest volume deleverage.\nGross margin was down nearly 90 basis points year-over-year primarily from the ramp of eBay International Shipping. Within our operating expenses, we observed a 1-point increase in product development expense as we invested in product and engineering talent to drive innovation across eBay. Sales and marketing was down modestly as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3 as our investments in full-funnel marketing initiatives were offset by cost efficiencies, including lower spend on coupons and incentives.\nDuring the quarter, we also accrued an additional $50 million to G&A expense on a GAAP basis related to pending legal matters. This adjustment is reflected in our non-GAAP reconciliations, while additional details on the accrual will be provided in our 10-Q filing.\nWe continue to focus on driving expenses out of the business, which is a crucial part of our path to long-term sustainable growth. And where we do choose to invest, we are able to partially offset that with OpEx savings driven by our structural cost program.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $777 million in Q3, up 23%. Our balance sheet position remains robust as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.4 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased over $650 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3 and had $1.7 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization at the quarter end.\nWe paid a quarterly cash dividend of $132 million in September or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 125% of cumulative free cash flow over that period. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, benefiting from a nearly 4% reduction in share count from our repurchase. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $2.46 with the delta driven by unrealized gains on our equity investment portfolio primarily from Adevinta.\nOur investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 21 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued over $4.5 billion at the end of Q3. Our 404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $4 billion at more than $1 billion versus the prior quarter. As we disclosed in late September, we have expressed support for the proposal made by the consortium of investors to Adevinta, under which we would retain a portion of our current holdings. As these discussions are ongoing, we are not in a position to provide any further comments on this transaction or the implications of such a transaction to eBay today.\nOur Adyen warrants were valued at nearly $200 million at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including adding share price and the probability of our remaining warrant tranches vesting. During Q3, the probability of vesting was positively impacted by an evolution on our usage of Adyen's products and services. The 3 remaining warrant tranches now carry probabilities ranging between 0% and 95%. However, the increase in probability was more than offset by a price decline in Adyen shares during the third quarter.\nMoving on to our outlook. Although our third quarter volume trends were slightly better than expected, we did observe softening consumer demand in September that carried through October. This macro softness was most pronounced in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, our second and third largest markets, respectively. We have also seen tapering demand in the U.S. market quarter-to-date. Given these trends, our base-case expectation is a continued pressure on discretionary demand will lead to a relatively muted seasonal uptick in volumes during the holiday season.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect to generate between $17.9 billion and $18.3 billion of GMV, representing an organic FX-neutral decline of between 4% and 2% year-over-year or spot growth between negative 2% and flat. The strength in U.S. dollar also creates an incremental FX headwind to fourth quarter GMV of roughly $400 million versus our prior guidance on a spot basis. This is on top of more than $100 million FX headwind to Q3 GMV.\nOn a sequential basis, we estimate FX will represent over a 1-point headwind to GMV growth and nearly 1 point of pressure to revenue growth. We anticipate Q4 revenue between $2.47 billion and $2.53 billion represents organic FX-neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 2% year-over-year. This implies revenue will outpace volume by 3 to 4 points on an organic FX-neutral basis in Q4.\nAs a reminder, our core take rate is typically down sequentially by 10 to 15 basis points in Q4 due to seasonal ASP and category mix, although this trend has occasionally been masked by payments and ads growth in the recent past.\nGiven our tempered outlook for Q4 volume and continued uncertainty in the global economy, we believe it is prudent to lean in more heavily into cost efficiencies to protect margins and earnings in this environment. We forecast non-GAAP operating margin between 26.1% and 26.7% during Q4, which would yield margins to the high end of our prior guidance range for the full year.\nWe forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1 and $1.05, representing EPS growth between negative 6% and negative 2% year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent a 4-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q4 as we lap meaningful hedging gains in the prior year period.\nOur outlook for free cash flow of just under $2 billion this year remains unchanged. As I noted last quarter, we expect de minimis free cash flow in Q4 due to the delayed timing of cash tax payments in 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are expected between 4% and 5%, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%.\nIn relation to 2024, it is premature to offer specific commentary as we are in the midst of our planning process. We remain committed to find an appropriate balance between growth and profitability to ensure we are positioned to durable financial returns in the years ahead. As such, we plan to grow expenses more slowly than revenue next year as we scale and leverage the investments we've made over the last few years. We will remain good stewards of capital as we continue to target returning 125% of cumulative free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases and dividends through 2024. We will target a certain level of capital returns from quarter-to-quarter while maintaining the flexibility to lean in opportunistically when appropriate.\nIn closing, our Q3 results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid continued challenges in the global economy. Our fortress balance sheet and operational discipline have enabled us to adapt to rapidly evolving demand environment while continuing to invest for the future, protecting earnings and delivering meaningful capital return to shareholders. I'm extremely proud of our teams for staying focused on our strategic pillars amid this uncertainty and further laying the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

Thank you all for joining us for eBay's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investor.ebayinc.com.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that during this conference call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures related to our performance.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of July 26, 2023. We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter in Q2, exceeding expectations across all key metrics while investing in a disciplined manner to support our long-term objectives.\nBefore I jump into the details around our second quarter results, I'd like to discuss the evolution of our strategy. Three years ago, I articulated our ambition of becoming the best global marketplace to buy and sell through a tech-led emargination of event. This would help us realize the enormous untapped potential of this company and put it firmly on a path to sustainable long-term growth. Since then, we've renewed our focus on products where we are uniquely positioned to offer meaningful choices and value for our customers.\nWe've accelerated innovation to adapt to the changing needs of buyers and developed world-class shopping experiences in our focus categories. And we've changed our marketing strategy to support these experiences pivoting to a full funnel approach aimed at attracting and retaining enthusiastic. These accomplishments make it a logical time to embark on the next phase of our deal.\nThe foundational work of our tech lever imagination will continue, including our prioritization of non-new in season products, expansion of focus categories in ads and payment initiatives. And now we're raising the bar for innovation and have set our sights on an even more ambitious vision, which is reinventing the future of e-commerce or enthusiast only at eBay. We will achieve this vision in the coming years by focusing on 3 key pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. Let's start with our first pillar, relevant experience. This means we are solving the specific and ever-changing needs of our customers across all shopping occasions.\nThrough our focused category strategy, we've proven that when we build relevant experiences, we can dramatically improve customer satisfaction, which translates into faster GMV growth. While we'll continue to understand customer needs and innovate at the category level, we will leverage the new tools, capabilities and technologies we have developed over the last few years to enhance more elements of the site-wide experience.\nThis includes developing a more relevant, consistent experience for the next generation of online shoppers through a comprehensive overhaul of our user experience and design rolled out in phases over the course of 2023 and beyond. This evolution will result in simpler, more personalized browsing experiences that will inspire people to sell, shop and connect with their community on eBay.\nThis initiative is a cross-collaborative effort between design, product, core AI, search, engineering and other key stakeholders to ensure our modernized shopping experience is powered by intelligent computing at scale. Enabled by artificial intelligence, we will fine-tune the breadth of inventory and other aspects of the shopping journey to cater to the varying needs of new buyers, infrequent shoppers and eBay enthusiasts.\nWe believe these innovations will increase our ability to bend cohort curves, drive higher lifetime values and all to grow enthusiasts and average spend per buyer. We began rolling out these changes to consumers in recent months starting with testing a more modern and intuitive QI page, which is the most visited page on eBay. The updated page offers a streamlined appearance, larger and higher resolution images and an optimized information hierarchy, early indicate a measurable uplift in GMV versus our existing design.\nOver the next few quarters, you will see a continued evolution of the look, feel and experience of our marketplace, including updates to view items, our header, homepage, search results and other landing patients. Alongside this work, we're investing in new capabilities for search, where relevant [indiscernible]. We're investing in technologies like deep learning and visual similarity to improve ranking and retrieval, reducing queries with lower node of results [indiscernible] more of our amazing inventory for customers.\nNow let's turn to our second pillar, scalable solutions. Combined with improving relevance, our scale is a powerful asset. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, eBay has 5 categories that each generate more than $10 billion annually in GMV, making up more than 80% of volume on our marketplace in aggregate.\nOur global footprint across 190 markets and density of supply and demand across major trade quarters are tremendous advantages in cross-border trains, and our proprietary data assets are powered by tens of billions of cumulative transactions and commercially relevant product information and images accumulated over our nearly 28-year history.\nOur scale enabled us to launch a proprietary managed payment solution capable of processing more than $70 billion in annualized volume in less than 2 years. It also allowed us to build our nearly $1.3 billion advertising business driven by Promoted Listings, which help our sellers drive greater velocity and price realization for their inventory.\nAds and payments have dramatically enhanced our financial architecture. But now we are widening the scope of scalable solutions on eBay to develop a broader suite of value-added services. Our payments infrastructure makes it possible for us to launch new financial services like FX conversion, alternative payment options and seller financing partnerships informed by transactions on eBay.\nWe're also investing in improved in-house risk modeling to alleviate transactional friction for sellers and buyers on eBay, which has led to measurable uplift in conversion and hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV during the first half of 2023. Our scale and cross-border capabilities allowed us to launch the eBay International shipping program earlier this year.\nThis program simplifies paperwork, lowers cost for buyers, streamlines returns enable sellers to tap into our global demand. While this program is still ramping up in the U.S. we are seeing positive proof points in the number of listings migrated, increased exportability of new listings as well as conversion, delivery times and operational costs in line with our expectations.\nThe cross-category nature of eBay makes our investments in individual focused categories more scalable to other areas. This is because technology and capabilities that are developed for one category can be adapted as quickly and seamlessly to others. For instance, eBay's authenticity guarantee program has enabled us to rapidly transform trust across new categories and countries, from watches to sneakers, handbags, jewelry and trading costs.\nNow it's faster and more cost efficient to launch authentication for a new category like we did this quarter with Street. We believe only eBay is an ambition to bring hyper relevant experiences like these to customers at scale across this breadth of categories.\nLastly, our third pillar is magical innovation. The foundational work we've accomplished over the past 3 years has set us up for a new phase of innovation. Our teams are focused on thinking bigger and moving faster as we build game-changing features and functionality for customers to keep eBay at the forefront of e-commerce.\nOur increased tech philosophy has allowed us to launch and rapidly iterate on exciting features like live commerce. Other examples include the ability to instantly buy and sell training cards in the eBay Ball and our improved computer vision capabilities that streamline buying and selling on eBay.\nOver the next few quarters and years, we expect advancements in artificial intelligence, including generative AI to impact nearly every aspect of our organization, driving meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements. More importantly, they enable truly compelling customer-facing experiences that I'm confident our customers will love, such as the magical listing experience I'm excited to discuss with you shortly.\nYou will continue to hear us talk about the progress of our evolved strategy and how we're delivering on the 3 pillars of relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. This work is all in service of our plan to reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. As I've mentioned, these efforts are already underway, and we have begun delivering these innovative features and functionalities to eBay customers.\nNow let me turn to the second quarter. We delivered better-than-expected results across the board in Q2 despite continued macro uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was over $18.2 billion while revenue grew 5% to $2.54 billion and outpaced GMV growth by roughly 6 points, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 5%.\nOur improving growth trends continue to be led by our focused categories, which grew roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during Q2. This outperformance continues to be led by motors, parts and accessories or P&A where GMV grew mid-single digits year-over-year for the second straight quarter, which we believe is in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce.\nWe also extended our focus category coverage through new launches and category expansions during the quarter. In early June, we launched authenticity guarantee for streetwear in the U.S. and are now authenticating new and pre-owned streetwear items from 20 trusted brands, including Kit, Off-White, Palace and Supreme. In July, we expanded eligible streetwear to mass appeal brands like Adidas, Jordan and Nike.\nBut later this year, we'll expand coverage to luxury plans, including Gucci, Product and Louis Vuitton. This marks our entry into authenticated apparel, a category that has strong overlap with our passionate community of sneaker enthusiasts, adding another layer of trust when they shop. In April, we launched the certified by brand program, which we also expect to facilitate more e-commerce in the luxury space.\nThere are already more than 20 brands participating in this program offering new and certified preowned inventory across the watch, jewelry and handbag categories. Listings from this program will show a direct from brand or brand authorized seller banks, bringing an enhanced level of trust to these listings, similar to visual trust signals for authenticity guarantee.\nBrands benefit from eBay's scale demand gained access to consumer and pricing insights while being able to maintain control of their brand equity and image online. eBay shoppers will benefit from these brands unique inventory and enhanced trust as these products will include certifications and/or warranties from the brands themselves.\nOur expertise in fashion is further extended by our recently closed acquisition of Serta Logan, a provider of AI-powered authentication for apparel. Jardelogo empowers brands and designers to manage the life cycle of their garden, protect their customers from counterfeits and encourages e-commerce via QR codes that serve as digital product platforms.\nWhile we are just beginning to explore the synergies between our companies. Darnelogo already works in a number of leading global fashion brands, and we are incredibly excited to leverage this technology to accelerate the circular e-comm.\nNext, I'd like to discuss the groundbreaking work our team is doing with artificial intelligence. In particular, I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we're ramping up a new feature we've been calling Magical listing, which will make it significantly easier for sellers to list their inventory. One of the biggest challenges to operating a listings-based marketplace is the burden on sellers to fill in descriptions and item aspects for their product.\nIn May, we launched the first version of our Magical listing experience, which dramatically reduces this friction for our sellers via AI-generated item description. We integrated Azure's open AI API into our core listing flat. And now sellers can choose to have detailed product information instantly populated by generative AI based on the product's title, categories and any item aspects that has been impacted.\nDuring the quarter, we ramped this beta feature to more than 50% of iOS and Android users in the U.S. and expect to reach 100% in the coming weeks. Early signals have been extremely positive. Approximately 30% of users have tried to feature at least one, and we've observed acceptance rates of over 90% for AI generating description, including those with Ed.\nCustomer satisfaction is over 80% this far, which is among the highest Vesak for any new feature launched in recent memory. Stars [indiscernible] told us that this feature will unlock more of the unique inventory in their closet. And on average, we are seeing description lengths double when Gen AI lead. But we are just getting started. The next iteration of our magical listing will leverage our improved image recognition capabilities to provide furs with the option of a more seamless camera-based listing.\nSellers can utilize their smartphone camera or existing photos to start a listing. And based on our visual understanding of the product, the eBay app can pre-populate the title, category, description and item specifics wherever possible. We have been testing this tool with our employees for several weeks, and we're incredibly excited to launch in public data in the coming months.\nThe advent of generative AI aspired an explosion of creativity at eBay among our product and engineering team who have conceptualized new and innovative shopping experiences that can be rapidly deployed onto the site. Two compelling examples that launched in July are the Shopify upgrade and engine code lookup features that went from concept to production in the eBay Motors app in just a few weeks.\nShopify upgrade uses generative AI to help customers discover the most relevant fitment enabled upgrade options for their vehicles. which are personalized based on the specific users' preference. NGI Code Lookup offers specific P&A products available on eBay that can address the root cause of hardtaipher ERCO, aiding them and identifying and fixing the source of the problem.\nI'm thrilled to see how quickly our teams are moving with this technology at their disposal and look forward to more of these experiences launching in pilots in the months ahead.\nTurning next to our advertising business, which continues to build impressive momentum. We reached a major milestone in Q2 as advertising revenue reached 2 penetration of GMV. Total ads grew 35% while first-party ad revenue grew roughly 50 points faster than GMV.\nOver 2.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q2, while we reached more than 800 million live prorated listings. Promoted Listing Standard, our CK product was again the largest contributor to growth in Q2, driven by attribution enhancements, continued optimization and ad rate improvement. At the end of March, we adjusted our attribution methodology for CPA ad, expanding the definition of what constitutes a qualified sales.\nThis change referred to as a halo attribution in the industry, enables us to more efficiently optimize our ads as we capture a more complete picture of the downstream sales driven by promoting them. While sellers maintain the full flexibility to adjust their bidding behavior after this change, Halo attribution had a net positive impact on our ad business in Q2.\nDuring the quarter, we also introduced a new way to rank ads on search which leverages our in-house AI capabilities to optimize CPA placements for both conversion and ad rate. Additionally, we improved our position in calculating trending and suggested ad rates and made it easier to adopt dynamic bidding, both contributed to a modest lift in Q2 ad rate.\nOur emerging Promoted Listings product also scaled nicely in Q2, growing more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings advanced, our CPC product was the largest contributor. Advanced recently exited beta into general lease as we have simplified the process of creating and managing campaigns, increase the visibility of CPC ads on eBay and demonstrated healthy return on ad spend levels to sell it.\nDuring Q2, we introduced suggested campaigns for VIX, which provide a one-click activation experience by offering customized keywords, bid and ad group structures for B2C sellers across 5 major markets. These campaigns will push out to sellers on a monthly cadence and can drive further adoption of CPC ad.\nNow let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. Last quarter, we published our annual impact report, which recognizes the progress we've made to our environmental and social good. As a pioneer of e-commerce, we are committed to helping sellers earn extra cash selling pre-loved items and helping buyers find items of value while promoting a healthier planet and economy.\nI'm proud that we continue to make important strides to our own climate goals while leading sustainability throughout our company culture and philanthropic efforts. Additionally, we will soon publish our first ever U.K. social impact report, which takes a closer look at the programs we're delivering for hundreds of underserved entrepreneurs social enterprises and charities in the U.K.\nThis includes programs like eBay for Change, which supports social entrepreneurs and creates jobs in marginalized and vulnerable communities. Another program with considerable impact is eBay for charity, which raised more than $38 million during the quarter. And I'm excited to announce that Engage for Good, a nonprofit organization dedicating to supporting the practice of cause marketing recognized eBay for Charity as a 2023 charity checkout champion.\nIn closing, I would like to thank our incredible employees for another strong quarter of execution and for continuing to bring our strategic vision to life. I have never been more confident that we are on the right path to unlocking our enormous untapped potential and reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay.\nOur focus on relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations will greatly benefit our loyal community of sellers and buyers in the quarters and years ahead as well as better cater to the needs of the next generation of on lunch offers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and offer some additional commentary on the remainder of the year before we begin Q&A.\nAs usual, my comments will reflect the year-over-year comparison on an organic fetal basis and the financial highlights. We delivered solid results in Q2 as our GMV revenue and EPS exceeded expectations and came in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.\nGross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1. Revenue was up 5% to $2.54 billion, which outpaced volume by 6 points, driven by accelerating growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 26.9%, down roughly 1.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of eBay international shipping ramp in recent M&A.\nWe delivered $1.03 in non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow by returning $383 million to shareholders to repurchase and dividends. Let's take a closer look at the key drivers of our financial performance during the second quarter.\nGross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1 due to continued momentum within focused categories and a notable acceleration in cross-border trade Foreign exchange represented a 1 point headwind to reported GMV growth in Q3.\nGMV growth in our focused categories accelerated modestly and outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 7 points during the second quarter. We launched a new focused category in U.S. Streetwork extended trading costs to Canada and broadened our inventory coverage in sneakers come back and jewelery drove a sequential increase in GMV coverage. P&A was once again the largest contributor to GMV growth among focused categories, growing in the mid-single digits year-over-year, in line with estimated market growth in this segment of e-commerce.\neBay refurbished and maintained healthy double-digit growth in Q2 and was the second largest contributor to focus category outperformance as consumers continue to turn for eBay for value in the current economic finance. Next, looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 4% organically in Q2, as domestic buyers continue to favor imports due to diminishing headwinds within global supply chains that benefited cross-border trade.\nInternational GMS grew 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 2 points sequentially. Although e-commerce growth remains weaker outside of the U.S. amidst heightened macro challenges, international GMV benefited from a sequential acceleration in volume from possible trading.\nMoving to active buyers. 132 million active buyers shop on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in June, down $1 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding M&A and biosim Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July of last year, we had 131 million active buyers, roughly flat versus Q1.\nAs we lap the Turkey closure this month, this factor will no longer be a headwind on reported active buyers next quarter. The continued stabilization of our bio cat was driven by the fourth straight quarter positive year-over-year growth in new and reactivated buyers, which was again led by double-digit growth in [indiscernible] P&A. In isolation, new buyers grew year-over-year for the second straight quarter, while growth by our churn has steadily improved throughout 2023.\n[indiscernible] buyers was stable at $16 million in Q2, as net migration pattern improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. Spend parents grew modestly year-over-year, averaging roughly $3,000 annually.\nTurning to revenue. We generated net revenue of $2.54 billion in Q2, up 5% an acceleration of roughly 3 points versus Q1. Total FX-neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A was 6% while currency was a 1 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9% in Q2, more than 30 basis points to [indiscernible] and up nearly 90 basis points year-over-year.\nAdvertising revenue was the largest driver of our take rate growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. The EBIT international shipping and recent M&A in aggregate contributed nearly 10 basis points to our Q2 take rate sequentially and new payment services contributed roughly 2 basis points.\nForeign exchange represented a sequential headwind of approximately 10 basis points to take away in the second quarter. Our advertising business accelerated notably in Q2 as total ad revenue grew 35%, a 12-point acceleration versus Q1. First party ad grew 49% roughly 50 points faster than volume. The GMV deltoidened by 17.\nHowever, roughly points of this gap were related to a onetime accounting adjustment of deferred revenue on cost per pick active following the halo attribution change Jamie discussed earlier. The deferral release brought forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue in Q2, which we will lap in Q3.\nThe outstanding results within our ads business were driven by continued optimization of promoter listing standards and the expansion of our emerging products like advanced and external promoted listings. As we lap onetime factors like our ad portfolio expansion, recent product optimization wins, halo attribution and the onetime accounting change, we do expect the GMV delta to now its current levels.\nHowever, we still anticipate advertising revenue will outpace GMV for the foreseeable future. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9% in Q2, down 1.7 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.5 points of this delta is due to the combination of eBay international shipping and recent M&A, while FX also represented a modest year-over-year headwind.\nGross margin was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a 1 point headwind from the progressive ramp of eBay international shipping which was partly offset by an increase in take rate driven by ads and other monetization efficiencies. So the marketing as a percentage of revenue was down nearly 80 basis points year-over-year in Q2 as our continued investment in full funnel marketing initiatives was offset by leverage on monetization efficiencies and lower spend on coupons and expenses.\nProduct development rose by 1.1 points as we continue to invest in product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation across the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 60 basis points, driven by M&A and higher employee spend.\nWe generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q2, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 4% net reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 so the debt were primarily driven by unrealized losses on our equity investment portfolio.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $492 million in Q2, up 6%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, and we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 million. We repurchased roughly $250 million in shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q2 and of roughly $2.3 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization.\nWe paid a quarterly cash dividend of $133 million in June or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.4 billion at the end of Q2. This represents a decrease of approximately $200 million sequentially, driven primarily by the recent share price decline in Adevinta.\nMoving on to our outlook. For the third quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.6 billion and $18 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between negative 4% and negative 1% year-over-year. We expect revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.52 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between 2% and 4% year-over-year.\nWe anticipate non-GAAP operating margin or between 25.8% to 26.5%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01 representing EPS growth between negative 4% and positive 1% year-over-year. We are currently planning our business on [indiscernible] subset to total FX-neutral GMV growth between negative 2% and negative 1% year-over-year for the full year of 2023.\nWe expect revenue to outpace GMV by approximately 4.5 points for the full year on a spot basis. Although FX neutral revenue growth should continue to outpace GMV mid-single digits during the second half. At current FX rates, our year-over-year growth in spot revenue and GMV would converge in Q4 as we lapped significant FX hedging gains in the prior year period.\nWe are now planning for full year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins between 27% and 27.4%. And our margin assumptions contemplate a year-over-year headwind of roughly 1 point in the combination of recent M&A and the eBay international shipping program.\nHowever, we do expect the operating margin impact from EAS to a base by the fourth quarter. Our margin assumptions imply more than $100 million of OpEx savings from our structured cost program in 2023, which will be redeployed into strategic objectives.\nIf foreign currencies follow the current rate, FX would represent a tailwind of roughly 0.5 point of GMV growth for the full year in 2023. However, FX would represent roughly 0.5 point headwind to operating margin for 2022 with approximately 2 points of impact during Q4 alone due to hedging gains in the prior year period.\nFX also represents more than a 2-point headwind to non-GAAP EPS for the full year. Lastly, for the full year, we expect to generate just under $2 billion in free cash flow. Due to California state disaster tax relief, the majority of our cash tax payments scheduled for 2023 have been deferred and will be paid in October.\nAs such, we expect the board to cover our remaining 2023 free cash flow to be recognized in Q3. We estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain unchanged at 16.5% throughout the rest of 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are still estimated to be between 4% to 6% of revenue.\nIn closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay as we delivered against our quarterly financial commitments and made significant progress on our long-term strategic objectives. Focused categories expanded in coverage positively influence growth for the marketplace overall. Our advertising business is driving robust growth at scale as first-party ads meaningfully accelerating relative to GMV. We continue to invest in product and full funnel marketing initiatives in a disciplined manner laying the foundation for sustainable growth, and we generated $492 million of free cash flow, returned $383 million to shareholders through reason dividends and have returned roughly 130% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 18 months.\nI continue to be inspired by the accelerating pace of innovation at eBay as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today.\nYou should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of April 26, 2023. We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our strong performance during the first quarter. We delivered better-than-expected results across our key financial and operating metrics despite continued challenges in the macro environment. Our emphasis on non-new-in-season goods, advancements of our focused category strategy, site-wide innovation for sellers and buyers and investments in trusted experiences have enhanced the durability of our marketplace and kept us on the path to achieving sustainable long-term growth.\nWe generated over $18.4 billion of gross merchandise volume in Q1, representing a 3-point acceleration in organic year-over-year growth sequentially and over 4% organic growth versus the first quarter of 2019. Revenue eclipsed $2.5 billion and grew 2% organically, outpacing GMV by roughly 5 points, primarily due to contributions from advertising. Our operating margin was 29.6%, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.11, up 5% year-over-year.\nOur financial results provide clear evidence that our strategy is working and driving underlying growth in our business. Our progress is most evident in focused categories, which outgrew the rest of our marketplace by roughly 8 points during Q1 and grew low single digits year-over-year overall. Our largest focused category, motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, accelerated a few points sequentially and was the largest contributor to GMV growth in Q1. Based on the data we are seeing, we believe P&A grew at market rates of growth for this category during the quarter, which is a testament to the results that are possible when we are laser-focused on driving customer satisfaction and awareness in even the largest categories.\nIn February, we launched the eBay Guaranteed Fit program in the U.S., which enables millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back. We accompanied the launch with a full funnel marketing campaign across TV, streaming video, audio and social channels to drive awareness and consideration of this compelling trust unlock. We're pleased with the initial reception of the Guaranteed Fit program and are excited to extend it to the U.K. and German markets later this year.\nWe also recently began a major revamp of how shoppers buy tires on eBay. We overhauled our tire installation experience on desktop and mobile web in Q4 and expanded the improved experience to mobile apps in Q1. Now buyers can more easily evaluate installation options as they browse and compare tires that fit their vehicle. Across 5 major markets, buyers can ship tires directly to 1 of over 10,000 local auto shops for installation rather than having to take delivery of these hard-to-transport items. While we are still in the early stages of connecting online sales to offline installations in P&A, these initial launches are already driving a meaningful uplift in the attach rate of installation services to tire purchases.\nWithin our focused categories, our eBay Refurbished program also continues to be a standout. In the current economic climate, our range of refurbished goods has proven to be more valuable than ever, and consumers are increasingly aware of the sustainability benefits of purchasing these products. Building off its record holiday quarter, growth in eBay Refurbished GMV accelerated notably during Q1, posting double-digit year-over-year growth. We added dozens of new categories to the program last quarter, including computing and video game peripherals. We also signed up more brands and OEMs in existing categories to sell refurbished inventory directly on eBay.\nAdditionally, in recent months, we've taken steps to make the onboarding process for small business sellers in the eBay Refurbished program faster and more scalable by automating elements of the sign-up and eligibility check processes. This is important because small business sellers make up the majority of refurbished goods sales on eBay and bring some of our most unique and valuable inventory to the platform.\nOur work to improve the site-wide experience on eBay continued to build momentum in the first quarter. While eBay has operated a core AI platform for years, an upgrade to this platform last year has meaningfully accelerated our AI development philosophy across multiple areas of our organization. In search, we continue to improve retrieval and ranking using state-of-the-art deep learning models and better leveraging the vast amount of structured listing data on our marketplace, which delivers more relevant choices to our buyers. A series of search deployments we made during Q1 led to a measurable uplift in conversion that we estimate would amount to roughly $1 billion in incremental GMV on an annualized basis. This demonstrates the value that a relatively small number of AI-powered enhancements can generate for a marketplace of our scale.\nAnother key area of foundational improvement is our proprietary computer vision technology. With 1.8 billion live listings and billions more images from historical sales, eBay is one of the few companies in the world training deep neural networks using tens of billions of images directly linked to commercially relevant data elements. Leveraging these assets, our product team recently reengineered our visual similarity models, which has dramatically improved the speed and efficacy of image search on eBay. This change has driven more relevant search results and a substantial increase in adoption, image query volume and purchase behavior. It also enables new features like the See Visually Similar results module we are testing within select subcategories of furniture and home decor.\nThese capabilities are powerful unlocks in helping eBay buyers discover more of the unique and hard-to-describe items on our marketplace. For example, if you have an antique vase that breaks, you can now just take a picture of the pattern and find an exact match for a potential replacement on eBay. Our advancements in computer vision also have profound implications for the selling experience on eBay. Over the coming quarters, you'll see us testing new experiences harnessing our improved visual and contextual understanding of product images to assist our sellers in listing products.\nFor instance, sellers will soon be able to pre-populate categories and item specifics from a single photo, enabling them to spend less of their time inputting inventory and more on growing and managing their businesses. eBay is also well positioned to benefit from recent leaps forward in generative AI capabilities. We are in the process of integrating the ChatGPT API into our core listing flow and will soon launch a beta release of a plug-in that enables sellers to automatically generate text for their item description based on known product attributes. Generative AI has a number of exciting use cases outside of descriptions, and we're exploring numerous potential applications across our marketplace that can enable truly magical customer experiences. I'm excited to share more about these initiatives with you over the coming quarters.\nFor store sellers, we recently launched a centralized tool, making it more seamless to publish and promote their listings across social media. This new feature is integrated into the Seller Hub and makes it easier to bulk post across several popular social channels with content that is automatically optimized for each medium, including engaging carousels that allow shoppers to browse multiple listings in a single post. Thousands of store sellers have already linked their social accounts to date, and on average, they observed 40% higher click-through rates on content published using this new tool versus what was previously available.\nLast quarter, we talked to you about the February rollout of our new eBay International Shipping program, which makes it as easy for eBay sellers to ship from Silicon Valley to Sydney as it is to ship to St. Louis. The revamped program is not only making cross-border trade more seamless and cost-effective for sellers and buyers, but it also improves trust through eBay's coordination of the end-to-end shipping process. During Q1, we fully ramped this program to sellers in the U.S. and migrated 100% of listings from our previous global shipping program. While it's early days for the new program, we're already observing a positive impact on customer satisfaction. Over the long term, we believe eBay International Shipping will increase cross-border inventory available to buyers, improve sales velocity and price realization for sellers and ultimately drive incremental GMV.\nNow transitioning to advertising. Our advertising business continues to deliver robust growth at scale despite challenges in the broader digital ad market. Strong demand for Promoted Listings drove first-party advertising revenue of $285 million, up 31% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth for the third straight quarter. Total advertising revenue grew 23% to $317 million. During Q1, over 2 million sellers adopted a single ad product, and we reached more than 750 million live Promoted Listings.\nOur standard CPA product was once again the largest contributor to advertising growth, benefiting from continued optimization and performance improvement. In Q1, we rolled out a new machine learning model for ranking CPA ads that improved sales philosophy for sellers and conversion for buyers. This ranking model also enables us to evaluate the expected performance of multiple ad products alongside each other rather than making ad-serving decisions in silos. This change will be beneficial as we continue to expand our multiproduct advertising portfolio.\nOur emerging Promoted Listings products also continued to scale and grew mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter during the seasonally slower Q1. This growth was led by Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost-per-click format, which benefited from an upgraded relevance model deployed in the quarter as well as the inclusion of CPC ads within more of our existing ad services.\nNow let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. I'm pleased that we continue to make meaningful progress on our key ESG initiatives. Just yesterday, we published our seventh annual Diversity Equity and Inclusion report. This report provides insight into our four strategic objectives: increase representation, cultivate a sense of belonging, engage our communities and allies and build inclusive technology. These objectives help us build a richly diverse, truly equitable and fiercely inclusive place to buy, sell and work.\nWe have seen a steady increase in the number of women and underrepresented minorities in all levels enrolled since 2020, with women representing 42% of our global workforce. I'm also proud to report eBay's gender pay equity is at 100% globally.\nThe next year I would like to highlight is around reducing our impact on the planet. 2 years ago, we set ambitious long-term science-based targets. In 2022, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 7% versus 2021 and by 32% from our baseline in 2019. We also continue to make progress on our Scope 3 reduction goal. Lastly, 91% of our energy now comes from renewable sources and we remain a carbon-neutral company. You can find more details about our sustainability programs in our annual impact report coming out next month.\nIn addition, we continue to partner with other organizations across the industry to make an even bigger impact on sustainability. Throughout 2022, we partnered with some of our e-commerce peers to encourage the U.S. Postal Service to adopt more innovative and sustainable shipping practices for small businesses. Our efforts culminated in a letter published in February 2023 congratulating USPS for their commitment to exclusively purchasing electric delivery vehicles by 2026. This shift not only helps the environment but also our customers by enabling lower costs and other benefits offered by an all-electric delivery fleet.\nTurning to eBay for Charity. The eBay community continues to demonstrate its tremendous generosity, and I'm always impressed by the contributions from this program. In Q1, eBay for Charity raised over $38 million, up 3% year-over-year. During the quarter, the program continued to support important initiatives like a Black History Month sneaker campaign, highlighting Black sneaker designers and influencers. Additionally, during Q1, the eBay Foundation committed $11 million to nonprofit organizations advancing inclusive entrepreneurship. The foundation also supported disaster relief efforts with employee contributions and matching gifts. All of these efforts combined demonstrate our purpose-driven community, and we are honored to be recognized for our progress.\nNewsweek recognized eBay for our efforts around diversity in the workplace as well as our customer service. Additionally, eBay was once again included in JUST Capital and CNBC's list of America's Most JUST Companies, which measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. Lastly, we were ranked among some of the top companies on S&P's Global Sustainability Yearbook, which distinguishes companies for their strengths in corporate sustainability.\nIn closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded our quarterly financial commitments while making significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories grew roughly 8 points faster than the rest of our marketplace, led by an acceleration in the P&A category, which reached market rates of growth in Q1. Our core AI platform has dramatically improved our tech velocity, leading to accelerated innovation in areas like search, computer vision, generative AI and advertising.\nWe continue to find more ways to leverage our scale for the benefit of sellers, most recently with our eBay International Shipping program. This initiative is reducing costs, alleviating friction and improving trust for cross-border transactions. And ultimately, we believe it will lead to more of our sellers' unique inventory being made available globally. And we continue to make meaningful progress with our pay equity, representation efforts, charitable contributions made through our platform and our impact on the environment.\nLastly, I'd like to thank our talented eBay employees who have been relentlessly focused on raising the bar for innovation and service to our customers. I'm also grateful I was able to meet and personally connect with a number of our sellers during my travel last quarter. Hearing their feedback and seeing the impact eBay is having on their businesses is truly inspiring. Our sellers, along with our enthusiast buyers truly make eBay a more vibrant marketplace and community.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the first quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll walk through our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the second quarter and some additional thoughts on the second half of the year before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-Neutral basis unless I note otherwise.\nOverall, I am pleased with our Q1 results as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations despite navigating a challenging macro environment for e-commerce. Gross merchandise volume was down 3% to $18.4 billion, improving 3 points sequentially, while FX was a 3-point headwind to reported year-over-year growth. Revenue was up 2% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points due primarily to continued momentum within our advertising business.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 29.6%, down 2.8 points year-over-year due to volume deleverage and continued investment in product innovation and full funnel marketing to support our strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.11 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $709 million of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year, while returning $384 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q1 results demonstrate the strength and durability of our scaled global marketplace during periods of economic uncertainty, as well as the meaningful impact our strategic initiatives are having on our long-term growth trajectory.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial performance during the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.4 billion was down 3% year-over-year on an organic FX-neutral basis or down 2%, including the impact of recent M&A. Organic GMV growth accelerated by 3 points sequentially in Q1, driven by continued outperformance in focused categories, strong initiative delivery within horizontal areas like search and healthy ROI on our marketing investments. The sequential improvement was also aided by the lapping of last year's macro downturn midway through the first quarter.\nFX represents the 3-point headwind to reported year-over-year GMV growth, which was roughly 0.5 point worse than the implied headwind in our Q1 outlook but an improvement of 3 points versus Q4. As noted last quarter, we estimate onetime factors contributed roughly $100 million to GMV in Q1, which we primarily attribute to CBT sellers keeping stores open during the Lunar New Year. Our focused categories continue to drive underlying growth in our business, a trend that is becoming more visible as macro-related lacking pressures subside. Focused categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 8 points during Q1. In aggregate, focused categories delivered positive low single-digit growth in Q1 as our business accelerated overall.\nMotors parts, accessories, or P&A, was once again the largest contributor to growth in our focus categories. P&A GMV accelerated by a few points sequentially in Q1, climbing to what we believe are market rates of growth for this category in our largest markets. P&A momentum has benefited from multiple quarters of product and fitment investments as well as full funnel marketing aimed at raising awareness and consideration among auto part shoppers.\nGrowth in refurbished goods accelerated a healthy double-digit growth in Q1, meaningfully contributing to our focused category outperformance. In support of our luxury categories, we recently leaned into paid, owned and earned media to grow awareness of our authenticity guarantee program with a particular focus on millennials and Gen Z. Although this campaign has just started, it has already improved perceptions of eBay as a trusted place to shop for high ASP items.\nNow looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 5% organically in Q1, accelerating by roughly 5 points versus the prior quarter, driven by strength in our focused categories and moderating lapping pressures. Diminishing headwinds to global supply chains and overall strength in cross-border trade did favor imports over domestic sales among U.S. buyers in Q1. International GMV declined 1% on an FX-Neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 3 points sequentially, benefiting from robust cross-border trade, particularly within P&A as well as outperformance in our other focused categories. Although key macro indicators like GDP and e-commerce growth remained notably weaker outside of the U.S., business conditions appeared relatively stable quarter-over-quarter internationally.\nMoving to active buyers, 133 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in March. We had 131 million active buyers, excluding recent M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations last July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down less than 1 million sequentially. We continue to see stabilization in our active buy account driven by buyer reactivation initiatives and particular strength in P&A. In aggregate, new and reactivated buyers showed positive year-over-year growth for the third straight quarter, while new buyer growth was positive for the first time in 8 quarters.\nEnthusiast buyers remained relatively stable sequentially at 16 million in Q1 as migration patterns between buyer groups continued to modestly improve. Enthusiast buyers make up roughly 70% of GMV on eBay and, on average, spend approximately $3,000 annually.\nTurning to revenue. Net revenue of $2.5 billion represented organic FX-Neutral growth of 2% year-over-year, accelerating by more than 3 points versus Q4. Total FX-Neutral revenue growth, including M&A, was 3%, while currency was a 2-point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.6%, down roughly 20 basis points sequentially but up over 80 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of currency, our take rate would have risen quarter-over-quarter as FX represented a headwind of roughly 35 basis points.\nIn terms of the drivers of take rate, recent M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping program in aggregate contributed roughly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate in Q1. Managed payments was modestly accretive to our sequential take rate, driven by new financial services. Our ads business continues to deliver impressive results and drive revenue in excess of volume growth. Total advertising revenue grew 23% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 31%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the third straight quarter. This delta was driven by optimization and performance improvements within our standard Promoted Listings product, paired with healthy growth in emerging products like advanced and external Promoted Listings.\nMoving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6% in Q1, down 2.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were roughly flat year-over-year as modest volume deleverage and roughly 0.5 point of pressure from the rollout of eBay International Shipping were offset by monetization efficiencies. Sales and marketing rose by over 1 point as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q1, and we continue to investing in full funnel marketing to support our focused categories. Product development rose by 1.3 points as we continue to hire product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation on the platform.\nOur G&A expense rose by roughly 1 point, driven by M&A, higher employee spend and volume deleverage. We generated $1.11 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 9% reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.05, aided by a modest recovery in our equity investment portfolio.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 30% to $709 million in Q1 as beneficial working capital items offset lower cash earnings. Our balance sheet position remains robust as we ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $5 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion, following a $1.2 billion debt repayment in January. We repurchased roughly $250 million of shares at an average price of approximately $46 during Q1 and have roughly $2.6 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $134 million in March or $0.25 per share.\nOur investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 19 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase in value sequentially, driven primarily by the recovery in our Adevinta shares.\nMoving on to our outlook. For the second quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion, representing organic FX-Neutral growth between negative 5% and negative 2% year-over-year. This outlook anticipates an FX headwind to reported GMV growth of over 0.5 point. We expect to generate revenue between $2.47 billion to $2.54 billion, representing organic FX-Neutral growth between 1% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 26.1% and 26.8% and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01, representing EPS growth between negative 3% and positive 2% year-over-year.\nOn a quarter-over-quarter basis, our Q2 guidance range implies total FX-neutral GMV growth of negative 4% to negative 2%. Given persistent macro challenges around the world, we believe it is prudent to prepare for continued uncertainty. First, we continue to plan our business around the assumption that GMV trends in the second half of 2023 roughly approximate the sequential growth we observed in 2022, excluding the impact of currency, starting from our Q2 spot GMV guidance range.\nFor the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive cost of revenue, by approximately mid-single digits year-over-year on a spot basis. The majority of this change versus our prior outlook or more than 2 points of the delta is driven by the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar on expenses in foreign currency, which also increases GMV and revenue. The remainder is driven by incremental investments in product and full funnel marketing as we're encouraged by the strong returns on the investments we've seen year-to-date.\nWe continue to expect our take rate to expand organically in 2023, excluding the impact of FX, driven primarily by continued momentum within our advertising business. As we noted last quarter, our expense forecast contemplates onetime impacts from recent M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping. These onetime factors in aggregate are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind to operating margin of approximately 100 basis points as compared to our 2022 P&L. Notably, we expect the eBay International Shipping program to generate positive operating profit dollars in 2023 and approach our corporate operating margin percentage by Q4.\nThe costs for this program have been in line with expectations to date and since they are almost entirely variable, they can be passed through to customer-facing shipping fees with a predictable margin for eBay. Our expense growth forecast is net of more than $100 million of OpEx savings from our structured cost program as we look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. With minimal noise from FX, our other income and expense reported in Q1 should be a reasonable baseline for the remaining quarters of 2023. We continue to estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. Lastly, if foreign currencies were to hold at today's rates, FX would represent a de minimis impact to GMV and a 2- to 3-point headwind for non-GAAP EPS in 2023 as we lap hedging gains from the prior year.\nIn closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS amid a dynamic global operating environment for e-commerce. Our focused categories continue to drive underlying growth in our business, while horizontal innovation in areas like search and International Shipping supports our marketplace overall. Our disciplined approach to full funnel marketing has fueled growth in new and reactivated buyers and improved awareness and consideration in focused categories.\nAdvertising growth continues to be robust as first-party ads outpaced GMV by more than 30 points for the third straight quarter due to continued adoption and optimization gains. We generated $709 million of free cash flow, returned $384 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends and reduced our net share count sequentially. And importantly, we continue to develop programs that support our communities, and we are making steady progress towards reducing our impact on the planet.\nI would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on operational excellence, which has enabled us to navigate short-term macro challenges while continuing to drive our business towards sustainable, long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year of consistent execution for eBay as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories drove underlying growth in our business as we expanded global coverage for our 16 million enthusiast buyers. In motors, parts and accessories or P&A growth accelerated as we improved our Fitment capabilities, increase supply of OEM parts and enhance trust signals for buyers. We extended authentication to new categories like trading cards and fine jewelry and opened authentication centers in several new countries for handbags.\nWe opened the Vault to store and digitally transact valuable items, and adoption has grown steadily week over week. We retired legacy technology, simplified the architecture of our core services and improved our tech velocity. Our advertising growth accelerated as we scaled our 3 newer Promoted Listings products, optimize performance and automated more elements of campaigns.\nWe expanded our financial services portfolio by adding FX conversion, new forms of payments like Klarna and Afterpay, faster debit card payouts and a digital wallet. And we balanced our investments in innovation with prudent cost discipline to establish a strong foundation for sustainable, profitable growth for many years to come.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics came in ahead of expectations despite the ongoing macro uncertainty. We generated over $18 billion in GMV and more than $2.5 billion in revenue. We delivered an operating margin of close to 30% while making critical investments in product and marketing to support our long-term growth strategy. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07, up 2% year-over-year.\nOur focused category strategy was a major component of our strong financial performance during the fourth quarter. Focus categories grew more than 7 points faster than the rest of our marketplace during Q4, which was 2 points faster than the prior quarter. Establishing a game-changing level of trust between sellers and buyers has been an important driver of the momentum in our focus categories.\nAuthenticity Guarantee enables trust in our luxury categories like watches, sneakers, handbags and fine jewelry. We have observed notable turnarounds in GMV growth since we launched authentication, improved the product experience and drew awareness to the great inventory in these categories.\nIn aggregate, our luxury-focused categories have grown at roughly double-digit CAGR since Q4 of 2019, proving these investments have been highly effective. We dramatically improved trust in our refurbished offering by introducing warranties and hassle-free returns, which attracted more brand and new categories to our marketplace. Those investments paid dividends in Q4 and with positive year-over-year GMV growth and the biggest sales week ever for refurbished goods during Cyber Week.\nTrust in our motors, parts and accessories category is most reliant on Fitment for ensuring the compatibility of auto parts with a specific vehicle. During the last few months, we have taken major steps forward with our Fitment capabilities. We acquired myFitment in Q3 to help sellers populate their listings with accurate Fitment data, which ensures compatibility for buyers. In Q4, we began making myFitment's technology accessible to all buyers, starting with a pilot group of P&A sellers.\nListings enhanced by this technology are seeing a measurable uplift in conversion, and we will expand this program further in 2023.\nOur significant investments in Fitment over the past few years allowed us to launch a prominent fit your vehicle badge in Q4. Similar to the Authenticity Guaranteed logo we show on luxury goods, this badge provides a clear indication of which parts fit your vehicle throughout the buyer journey across search, merchandising, view item and checkout. This is no small feat with over 500 million active P&A listings on eBay and the increasing complexity of vehicles in the marketplace.\nThese advancements have significantly elevated our capabilities for P&A shoppers, and I'm pleased to share a new program we launched just last week called eBay Guaranteed Fit. This program is the breakthrough for trust in P&A that Authenticity Guarantee is in luxury and warranties are for eBay Refurbished. It provides buyers with assurance that eBay will stand behind them if a part doesn't fit their vehicle. Guaranteed Fit is a huge milestone for the P&A category and the culmination of our multiyear Fitment journey. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for executing the foundational work making this program possible. And I'm looking forward to seeing their continued innovation in the category.\nI'm also excited about our team's work in collectibles, which has benefited from a steady cadence of product development and partnerships, including most recently, our live commerce beta. During Q4, we scaled up a number of eBay live events with select sellers, bringing a healthy level of viewers, engagement and GMV to participating sellers. We also introduced the eBay Live hub, where users can subscribe to channels and receive notifications about future events. This hub will serve as a central discovery point as we broaden the availability of live commerce to more sellers and categories this year.\nOur acquisition of TCGplayer has also greatly enhanced our collectibles category. And in Q4, we began developing synergies between our respective marketplaces. In addition to its customer base of nearly 800,000 hobbyists, a major competitive advantage for TCGplayer is its relationship with thousands of local brick-and-mortar hobby shops with many subscribing to its point of sale and channel management solution.\nDue to this software, sellers can now more easily streamline listings and inventory on both TCGplayer and eBay. TCGplayer also further diversified its marketplace by introducing Comics during Q4, which is a natural adjacency to collectible card games. eBay's historical sales data enabled TCGplayer to launch Comics with robust pricing intelligence, which will help us scale this offering. While our integration is in its early days, I'm incredibly excited to see what TCGplayer community will bring to eBay over time.\nOne of the key pillars of our strategy is being the platform of choice for sellers. eBay's scale and global footprint represent key advantages for our platform as we work toward achieving this vision. In 2022, roughly 1/5 of our GMV was facilitated through cross-border trade. Sellers who activate their listings internationally can reach buyers in over 200 countries globally. However, less than half of the inventory in our top 3 markets is currently available for export due to the friction associated with these transactions.\nTo unlock more valuable inventory for global buyers, last fall, we announced a major revamp of our cross-border capabilities with the launch of eBay International Shipping. Under this program, eBay handles any customs forms, coordinates duties with buyers and intermediates returns. Sellers are protected from item-not-received complaints while buyers benefit from greater selection and lower shipping costs. The program is resonating well as we gradually ramp enrollment for sellers, while buyer satisfaction on eBay international shipping transactions reached 80%. Steve will discuss the financial implications of this program, and I'm confident it will increase cross-border inventory and drive incremental GMV for eBay.\nInvestments in AI are also improving customer perception of our shipping capabilities. In Q4, we deployed a new machine learning model for estimated delivery date in the U.S. and select international markets, enabling us to make more accurate delivery predictions to buyers. Applying this model in the U.S. reduced the average delivery estimate by 1.5 days for all domestic listings, resulting in a noticeable uplift in conversion.\nA separate model deployed for eligible Authenticity Guaranteed products resulted in an average reduction of approximately 2 days for U.S. listings. These rollouts are just the latest example of our ability to leverage AI to make our existing processes more efficient, which will be a continued focus for us in 2023 and beyond.\nMoving on to ads. Our marketplace continues to benefit from innovation in our advertising business, which delivered strong growth in Q4 despite headwinds in the.\nMoving on to ads. Our marketplace continues to benefit from innovation in our advertising business, which delivered strong growth in Q4 despite headwinds in the broader digital ad market. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue of $276 million, up 27% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth. Over 2 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q4 and we eclipsed $700 million live voted listings.\nAdditionally, our total ad revenue is nearing 1.8% penetration of GMV.\nPromoted Listing Standard was again the largest contributor to growth, both on a sequential and an annual basis as optimization gains from prior quarters continue to benefit ad rates. In Q4, we also improved our merchandising algorithms to show a greater diversity of products, which improves buyer satisfaction while also preserving relevance and conversion.\nOur newer ad products also continued to scale nicely in Q4 and grew more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost-per-click product, continues to be a standout among the new products. Seller adoption of Advanced has grown as we have expanded access and automated more elements of campaign management to make this powerful ad unit easier to use.\nIn Q4, we launched Quick Setup, a one-click campaign creation solution for sellers, where eBay automates and optimizes the campaign structure, ad groups targeting and keyword bids for CPC advertisers. We also introduced multiuser account access across our full suite of promoted listings, which enables eBay sellers to delegate campaign management to trusted third parties like brands or ad agencies.\nTurning to payments. We continue to roll out additional payment services to support high ASP transactions and improve buyer conversion. During Q4, we introduced split payments in the U.S. for transactions over $1,000, enabling buyers to spread large purchases across 2 credit cards. We've already processed transactions from thousands of buyers at an average order value of over $3,000, and we're excited to expand this offering globally later this year to better support our focus categories.\nAdditionally, building on the success of Afterpay, we recently partnered with Zip to introduce a suite of buy now, pay later options to our Australian buyers. Zip supports purchases of up to $10,000 a extending our ASP coverage in this valuable market. By managing our end-to-end payments process, we are also able to leverage our own proprietary risk models to assess transaction requests across our marketplace.\nLast year, our risk and protection team rolled out enhanced controls that allowed us to approve transactions that may have otherwise been declined in the past, enabling over $0.5 billion of annualized GMV and reducing potential escalations to customer service.\nIn connection with risk management, we continue to invest in the security of our marketplace to ensure our capabilities remain world-class. Last week, we announced the acquisition of 3PM Shield, a provider of state-of-the-art marketplace compliance tool. 3PM Shield offers effective solutions for the prevention and identification of counterfeit listings and prohibited items. Combining this technology with our proprietary data, will further enhance the integrity of our marketplace.\nBefore we move on, I'd like to touch on the actions we've taken to sharpen our focus as a company and run our business more efficiently, particularly in light of the uncertain economic environment. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 500 jobs or roughly 4% of our global employee base.\nThis decision followed a thoughtful review of our organization to ensure our people and roles were aligned with priorities that advance eBay's commitment to long-term sustainable growth. These changes provide additional flexibility for us to invest efficiently and create new roles in high potential areas of our business like new technologies, trusted customer experiences and key markets.\nThere is no easy way to say goodbye to our talented colleagues, their passion and accomplishments over the last few years have helped us get us to where we are today. We are incredibly thankful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this difficult transition.\nNext, I'd like to share a few milestones from our ESG efforts last year, starting with recommerce. In 2022, our marketplace generated $4.6 billion in positive economic impact through the sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions and kept 73,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills.\nRecommerce continues to provide significant economic benefit for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times. And buying pre-loved items shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, just yesterday, we published our third annual Recommerce Report, which found that 90% of surveyed respondents engaged in recommerce during 2022.\nCost savings were the most popular motivator for buying pre-loved especially among Gen Z buyers. 64% of whom said it's financial savings as a primary reason for shopping e-commerce and sustainability was the second most important factor with people increasingly turning to pre-loved to help the environment. This positions us well as we continue to pave the way as an industry leader enabling economic empowerment and sustainability through our platform.\nNow let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. In Q4, eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise more than $35 million. And for the year, customers raised over $163 million. This represents an all-time high in fund raised through eBay for Charity since we started this program 20 years ago.\nThe eBay Foundation granted nearly $23 million in 2022, primarily to nonprofit organizations advancing inclusive entrepreneurship and through our employee matching gift programs. This represents another all-time high for annual foundation grants. I am fortunate to lead a purpose-driven company with a team dedicated to helping communities around the world while protecting our planet.\nFor the fourth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices. We were also included on CDP's A List for 2022, which recognizes companies that are leading the way in environmental transparency and performance on climate change. Additionally, eBay ranks #1 on cross-border commerce Europe's list of the top sustainable marketplaces operating in Europe. Looking to 2023, I'm incredibly excited about the road map ahead of us.\nToday, I'll offer just a glimpse of a few areas where you should expect to see progress from us this year. We'll continue to innovate for customers in our focus categories and extend to new countries and categories this year. We will continue our work in P&A by expanding the Guaranteed Fit program and fit your vehicle badge globally.\nWe'll also grow our tire installation capabilities after we began improving the end-to-end tire shopping experience and broadened our network of installation partners in 5 markets during Q4. We'll ramp assets in the Vault and extend eligibility for more collectible items, while integrations with TCGplayer and KnownOrigin will strengthen our value proposition for collectors. We will also continue to iterate next-gen shopping features like Live commerce to better engage with enthusiasts.\nAnd we will further develop the category landing pages we debut for sneakers, watches and handbags in Q4, which offer trending inventory and personalized recommendations powered by machine learning. Sellers across our marketplace will benefit from the expansion of our international shipping program to more markets which will drive incremental GMV as sellers tap into our global demand.\nWe will continue to scale our advertising offering as we track toward our next $1 billion by 2025. We'll simplify and grow adoption of Promoted Listings Advanced, deliver more AI-driven optimization and further expand our ads portfolio. Finally, just as we have done in focus categories, this year, we will adapt our one-size-fits-all approach to build more relevant and compelling localized experiences in some of our European markets. We will enhance local discoverability, reduce friction through simplified selling experiences offer new local forms of payment and address other market-specific experience gaps in search, language and return policies.\nIn closing, I would like to thank our extraordinary eBay employees for their accomplishments this year. Their unrelenting focus on serving our community has supported our sellers and buyers during these challenging economic times. I'm confident that with our talented eBay team, our strategic vision and a persistent focus on operational excellence we will continue to develop compelling experiences for customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nSenior VP & CFO, eBay Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the fourth quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and some additional color on 2023 before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise.\nWe delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations and landed near the high end or above our expected guidance ranges. Gross merchandise volume declined 6% to $18.2 billion, while FX was a 6-point headwind to reported growth. Revenue was down 1% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points, primarily due to FX and robust growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9%, down 1.8 points due to volume deleverage and continued investment at the marketing to support the strategic initiatives.\nWe delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 2% year-over-year, and we generated $533 million of free cash flow up 43% year-over-year, while returning $419 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results demonstrate the continued resilience of our marketplace amid economic uncertainty. I'm extremely proud of our teams delivering on their quarterly financial commitments, maintaining prudent cost discipline and executing key deliverables in support of our long-term growth objectives.\nLet's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume is down 6% year-over-year, decelerating roughly 1 point sequentially. Our business remains resilient despite headwinds from geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, low consumer confidence and rising interest rates.\nAdditionally, FX was a headwind of approximately 6 points of GMV, roughly 0.5 point greater than Q3. Momentum in focused categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business. In aggregate, focused categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by over 7 points year-over-year during Q4, roughly 2 points faster than the prior quarter delta.\nMotors Parts and Accessories growth accelerated sequentially and remain the largest contributor to this outperformance and we are excited to see what recent rollouts like fit your vehicle badge and Guaranteed Fit program will do for momentum in this category. Refurbished Goods also contributed positively to growth in Q4 as we continue to expand to new brands and categories.\nWe've also made the onboarding process for third-party sellers more scalable to increase the breadth and depth of refurbished selection on our marketplace. Within our luxury and trading cards categories, we continue to see healthy trends in authenticated item transactions in Q4, which has mitigated the macro-driven ASP pressure observed across these industries in recent months.\nAs you'll recall, we closed the acquisition of TCGplayer at the end of October. The partial quarter of GMV revenue and expenses are included in our financials for Q4. But based on the timing of the deal close, TCGplayer contribution is not material to results.\nLooking at our business on a geographic basis. Our U.S. GMV declined 9% year-over-year in Q4, decelerating by roughly 2 points versus the prior quarter. International GMV declined 4% on an FX-neutral basis, which was stable sequentially. Compared to Q4 of 2019, our total marketplace grew 2%, a deceleration from 6% last quarter. Versus 2019, U.S. GMV rose 12% in Q4 while international GMV was down 5%. Although macro headwinds remain more pronounced in Europe, our focused category strategy continued to drive underlying growth internationally, including positive year-over-year growth in P&A and notable strength in luxury categories during Q4.\nMoving to active buyers. 134 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months. We had 132 million active buyers, excluding our TCGplayer acquisition and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down roughly $1 million sequentially as a gradual improvement in buyer reactivation over the past few quarters has led to modest stabilization in our active buyer counts.\nEnthusiast buyers accounted for over 16 million of our active buyers in Q4, down less than 0.5 million sequentially and churn within enthusiasts remains de minimis. The net downward migration of enthusiast, the mid-value group, was also the lowest we observed since we began disclosing these buyer groups as lapping pressure has eased in recent quarters. Average spend per enthusiast rose again sequentially and continue to be healthy at above $3,000 annually.\nTurning to revenue. You'll notice in our Q4 earnings release and upcoming 10-K that we are now presenting a single net revenues line, which better aligns our reporting with how our business is operated. We provided one final quarter of marketing services and other revenue in Slide 12 of our earnings presentation. Today and moving forward, when we refer to take rate, we will be referencing our all-in net revenue divided by GMV.\nNet revenue was down 1% to over $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter, a 1 point acceleration versus Q3. Our take rate was 13.8% in Q4 at roughly 40 basis points sequentially. Although FX hedge gains were the most significant driver of our sequential take rate increase in Q4, we continue to see healthy contributions in both advertising and payments revenue.\nOur advertising business continues to build momentum. Total ad revenue grew 19% during the quarter. Our third-party ads grew 27%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the second straight quarter. This extraordinary result was primarily driven by optimization and performance improvements in our standard promoted listings product. Healthy growth in our newer products, most notably, our cost-per-click ads also contributed meaningfully. Our legacy third-party display ads were weaker in Q4 due to industry-wide headwinds over the holiday. But these ads represent an increasingly smaller portion of our mix.\nManaged payments contributed nearly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate expansion, driven by new financial service offerings. These include buyer and seller FX conversion that facilitates cross-border trade, faster debit card payouts and new high SP transaction services supporting our luxury categories. Importantly, both advertising and payments remain on track to meet our multiyear revenue targets we discussed at our Investor Day.\nMoving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9% in Q4, up nearly 1 point sequentially but down 1.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were down modestly year-over-year due to volume deleverage and authentication costs, partly offset by lower payment processing fees. Sales and marketing rose by over 1 point as a percentage of revenue as we invested in full funnel marketing to support our focused categories. While product development was relatively flat as some onetime impacts offset continued hiring of technical talent. Our G&A expense rose as a percentage of revenue due to charitable contributions and other onetime items.\nIn Q4, we recognized a GAAP charge within G&A expense of $50 million related to pending legal matters. You'll see this adjustments included in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Additional details on this accrual will be provided in our upcoming Form 10-K. We generated $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, up 2% year-over-year, benefiting from a 12% reduction in share count from our share repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, with the delta being driven by a recovery in our equity investment portfolio.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 43% to $533 million in Q4, driven primarily by the lapping of cash tax payments on investment sales in the prior year. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.9 billion and gross debt of $8.9 billion, following a successful $1.2 billion debt raise in November.\nWe repurchased roughly $300 million of shares at an average price of approximately $42 during Q4 and have over $2.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $119 million in December or $0.22 per share.\nOur investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments were valued at approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Following the sale of a de minimis number of shares in December to satisfy regulatory requirements, our 404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Our Adyen investment value is calculated based on the probability of our remaining warrant tranche vested.\nIn addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2022, we continue to evaluate inorganic opportunities to accelerate our strategic objectives by our build, buy, partner framework. We closed the acquisition of 3PM Shield last week, which will strengthen trust in our marketplace. They're helping us prevent and detect problematic listings with even greater precision.\nMoving on to our outlook. For the first quarter, we forecast GMV between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between negative 5% and negative 4% year-over-year. This GMV outlook includes an estimated $100 million from onetime benefits already recognized in Q1 and anticipate an FX headwind to reported growth between 2 and 3 points. We expect to generate revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.5 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year.\nWe anticipate a non-GAAP operating margin between 29.1% and 29.7%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.05 and $1.09, representing EPS growth between flat and up 3% year-over-year.\nAlthough we are not providing full year guidance at this time, given the dynamic operating environment, we will share some directional color on how we are currently thinking about 2023. Our baseline expectation is that the external demand environment does not materially improve during the first half of the year as a result of continued macro uncertainty across our largest markets. While we do see potential for an improvement in underlying economic conditions as the year progresses, it is too early to predict the second half recovery, buying out with confidence.\nAs a result, we currently expect our sequential GMV growth beyond Q1 to roughly approximate the seasonality we observed during 2022, excluding the impact of currency. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue by approximately 2% year-over-year on a spot basis, as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives in 2023.\nThis forecast contemplates onetime impacts to our P&L from recent M&A and the rollout of the eBay International Shipping program this year. These onetime factors combined are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind for operating margin of approximately 120 basis points versus 2022.\nOur expense growth forecast is also net of roughly $100 million of OpEx savings from our structural cost program as we continue to look inward for cost efficiencies in our business.\nI'd like to share some additional context on the onetime impact to margin. Over the past year, we accelerated our progress towards several core strategic objectives through the acquisitions of TCGplayer KnownOrigin, myFitment and 3PM Shield. While we are excited about the synergies and long-term growth potential of these assets, layering them into a scale in the marketplace with our level of profitability does present a natural drag on margins in the short term, which will diminish as our integration work progresses.\nThe rollout of eBay International Shipping will improve seller velocity and global availability of unique inventory over the long run. Our role in intermediating shipping and returns in this program will shift us to principal relationship with sellers versus being an agency in our previous global shipping program.\nFrom an accounting perspective, this means revenue from the new program will be recognized on a gross basis, while the vast majority of expenses are variable and recognize the cost of revenue. While the operating margin headwind from this program will abate as we progressively scale it through 2023, it's primarily variable costs or impact our reported gross margins. We expect this program to generate incremental operating profit this year despite representing a headwind of 30 basis points of gross margin in Q1, rising to 120 basis points in Q4.\nAdditionally, we expect foreign exchange to represent a headwind of approximately 1% of GMV in 2023 and between 3% to 4% to non-GAAP EPS, following the unwinding of recent U.S. dollar strength. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 16.5% throughout 2023.\nOn the capital allocation front, I'm pleased to announce our Board recently approved a 14% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising to $0.25 per share in 2023. We continue to target returning approximately 125% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2022 and 2024, and our broader capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.\nOur fortress balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage in this environment that enables us to invest organically in our business, accelerate our strategic objectives with disciplined inorganic investments, while still delivering healthy capital return to shareholders.\nIn the current macro environment, we believe it is prudent to balance the timing and magnitude of share repurchases with our capital needs from quarter-to-quarter. Our first priority is offsetting dilution, and we expect to be opportunistic with regard to larger repurchases.\nIn closing, our Q4 results capped off a resilient year for eBay in 2022 as we made meaningful progress towards our long-term strategy despite significant macro uncertainty. We exceeded consensus expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS during Q4. Our focused categories continue to outperform and are driving underlying growth in our business.\nOur advertising revenue continues to meaningfully outpace volume growth while payment initiatives continue to scale in line with expectations. We achieved a full year operating margin of 30% despite contending with a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. We generated nearly $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2022 and returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through free purchases and dividends, equating to nearly 170% of our free cash flow.\nI'm proud that eBay continues to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment and sustainability to our platform. We once again achieved carbon neutrality in 2022 and remain committed to reducing 90% of our carbon emissions from our operations by 2030. I'm incredibly appreciative of our team's focus and execution during 2022 as we delivered on a number of our core strategic objectives despite navigating uncertain macro environment.\nI'm confident our investments in 2022 enabled us to exit the year stronger than when we entered it, keeping us on a path to sustainable long-term growth.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the eBay Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Joe Billante, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nJoe Billante\n\nVP of IR, eBay Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the third quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Jamie's and Steve's commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance.

Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q3 was a strong quarter for the company despite a challenging macro environment. Significant headwinds from inflation, higher energy costs and rising interest rates have impacted discretionary income, and consumer confidence is near record lows in several markets. Our focus on non-new-in-season categories has made the platform more resilient against these headwinds.\nIn the quarter, we continued to execute the tech-led re-imagination, and we delivered on our near-term commitments. Focus categories narrowed their gap to market growth rates through higher customer satisfaction, increased trust and more effective marketing. And once again, enthusiast buyers spent more on the platform. This playbook is having a positive impact on GMV in the U.S. and internationally.\nSite-wide technology investments created a more seamless customer experience, leading to improved conversion rates across the platform. Our advertising business accelerated due to increased seller adoption and the optimization of our ad products. And new payment capabilities removed transactional friction while adding incremental revenue.\nThe execution of our strategy is strengthening our competitive position, which drove better-than-expected financial outcomes in the third quarter. We delivered over $17.7 billion in GMV and almost $2.4 billion in revenue. We invested in marketing and product while delivering close to 29% operating margin. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1 per share, up double digits versus last year.\nBefore I get into more highlights from the quarter, I want to take a step back and look where we are in our long-term journey. As you may recall, heading into the pandemic, volume was declining. Since that time, we have invested in game-changing product experiences and adjusted our approach to marketing. And this has resulted in an improvement in GMV compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nSpecifically, focus categories, excluding trading cards, are up over 20% since 2019 due to improvements in customer satisfaction, trust, product experience and marketing. Trading cards has more than doubled in that time due to market dynamics and the impact of our innovations. And the rest of the platform has improved from declining low single digits to flat based on site-wide product improvements and the benefits of cross-category shopping.\nTaking a closer look at Q3 volume, excluding trading cards, focus categories grew over 7 points faster than the rest of the platform compared to last year. Multiple quarters of improvements in parts and accessories, collectibles, luxury goods and refurbished products are driving better relative GMV performance.\nMotors parts and accessories is the largest category we have invested in to date, and it is nearing market rates of growth. Investments in marketing over multiple quarters have increased consideration with enthusiasts, expanding the top of the funnel. Most recently, we sponsored an automotive makeover show with MTV U.K. We also kicked off the eBay Motors Parts of America tour, showcasing bespoke car builds using parts found on eBay. Hundreds of thousands of attendees have joined these events to date, and social marketing support for the tour has driven more than 500 million impressions.\nThe key to unlocking trust for parts and accessories enthusiasts is fitment. Over the last several quarters, we made significant progress on the foundational work needed to innovate the P&A experience. This included modernizing our taxonomy to align our business globally and open up new cross-border trade opportunities. We also integrated fitment-based technologies into search, merchandising and advertising recommendations. Now we're able to make fitment more pervasive throughout the end-to-end experience.\nWe have started adding highly visible trust signals throughout the buyer journey in the U.S. and Canada. We also are reducing the number of steps it takes to find parts, and we've expanded the adoption of My Garage, leading to more personalized shopping on every visit. We will continue to invest in trust to deliver even higher customer satisfaction in the coming quarters.\nIn addition, we are working on increasing the quality and quantity of supply in parts and accessories. We recently acquired myFitment, which helps P&A sellers improve listing quality and grow conversion. We are also directly engaging sellers to add more in-demand parts inventory, including certified green parts, OEM, salvage and [high ASP] products, keeping our global supply over 500 million live listings.\nCollectibles is another focus category where sellers and buyers are responding positively to recent innovation. One of the best examples of this is trading cards, where GMV trends remained steady at a trajectory more than double pre-pandemic levels. In June, we launched the eBay Vault, a seamless end-to-end physical and digital experience and have initially opened it for trading cards. The Vault provides a number of benefits, including instant transfer, authentication, insurance, affordable shipping and tax-free storage. The combination of these features gives enthusiasts an unprecedented level of control to grow the value of their collections.\nDuring Q3, we expanded eligibility for Vault items, and we are seeing continued momentum week-over-week and are encouraged by the effectiveness of events and accelerating early adoption. While the Vault is in its early days, demand is increasing, and more enthusiasts are preloading their inventory into the Vault to enable faster trading.\nIn addition to innovation, we are marketing our trading cards business across multiple channels. For example, in Q3, we expanded our presence at New York Comic Con to showcase the eBay Vault and continued live commerce pilots, highlighting brands like Funko and MetaZoo.\nAnother important investment for our trading card business is the acquisition of TCGplayer, a trusted marketplace for collectible card game enthusiasts that operates a leading technology platform. I am pleased that we were able to close this transaction earlier this week ahead of schedule. TCGplayer brings strategic omnichannel capabilities, popular with trading card sellers, including inventory management tools, order fulfillment and card optimization. I'm excited to see what we can do together to delight our sellers and buyers over time.\nIn luxury categories, quarter after quarter of innovation has led to higher customer satisfaction and faster GMV growth. This has been true in watches, handbags and sneakers since the introduction of authentication, resulting in higher GMV in every country where we've launched to date. In Q3, we began authenticating jewelry above $500 in the U.S. and are seeing similar results as other focus categories with initial customer satisfaction rates for jewelry buyers over 90%.\nFocus category is not the only area where we are investing to drive GMV. Significant site-wide initiatives that impact all sellers and buyers are driving volume benefits across all categories. Multiple quarters of technology investment drove site-wide conversion improvements in Q3.\nFor example, in search, we leveraged new deep learning models to better understand purchase intent, leading to increased conversion at the top of search. In addition, search recall has materially improved for low and well searches, enabling buyers to discover more relevant inventory. These capabilities have rolled out to English and German-speaking markets, adding more than $0.5 billion in GMV annually.\nSEO improvements are driving better growth across the platform. In focus categories like sneakers, we have built a more modern browsing experience, which is driving benefits to our SEO traffic. We also optimized our site to allow significantly more items to show up on search engines, increasing visibility to our newest and best performing listings. For sellers, we have been making investments over several quarters to modernize our technology stack. And I'm excited to announce that we recently completed the migration of all desktop sellers to a single unified listing experience globally. This transition eliminates multiple legacy tools and enables faster innovation, particularly as we invest in new focus category listing experiences.\nThere are a number of benefits sellers are already seeing in the new platform. For example, when listing an item, sellers are receiving better price guidance recommendations that are driving conversion in multiple categories. And sellers can now directly upload videos that can showcase items, highlight unique details or answer commonly asked questions. Sellers are also benefiting from multiple quarters of innovation and advertising.\nHigher return on ad spend is leading to increased adoption of Promoted Listings and higher ad rates. In Q3, first-party ad revenue was $249 million, up 27% year-over-year. This was more than 30 points faster than GMV, keeping us on track toward our long-term advertising targets despite volume headwinds from the macro environment. Investments in AI have resulted in improved search algorithm performance and more accurate ad rate recommendations that are increasing conversion. This is one factor driving up adoption of Standard Promoted Listings. In Q3, almost 2 million sellers adopted at least 1 ad product, and our coverage has expanded to over 600 million listings.\nOur newer ad products are also driving faster growth, which once again grew double digits quarter-over-quarter. For Promoted Listings Advanced, we expanded availability in search. We also improved the broad match experience and upgraded our recommendation tools, allowing sellers to further optimize their campaigns. Payments capabilities are increasing trust between sellers and buyers by removing transactional friction. The buyer FX experience that we've released earlier this year is resonating with customers.\nClose to 70% are adopting it for cross-currency transactions, allowing them to pay in their local currency. We also expanded Klarna availability to buyers engaged in cross-border transactions on our German site. Lastly, our risk team improves checkout conversion by accepting more purchase transactions while maintaining low loss levels.\nIn addition to removing friction for buyers, we are adding more services for sellers. Recently, we announced that sellers can request on-demand payouts to a debit card and receive funds within 30 minutes or less for a fee. New payment services are delivering better customer outcomes, and the pace of innovation has put us on track to deliver $300 million in incremental revenue by 2024.\nAs consumers in our major markets face persistent inflation, higher interest rates and rising home energy costs, they are increasingly turning to eBay for better value. This is leading to growth in GMV of used and refurbished goods. In fact, in a recent survey, we found that more than 3/4 of sellers use eBay to sell pre-owned goods. Recently, we expanded our efforts to support sustainable commerce with a new seller education offering on eBay Academy. Launched across our major markets, our new course teaches sellers how to assess their current practices and understand how eBay can help them operate more sustainably. Sellers are contributing positively to global communities in other ways.\nDuring the third quarter, we raised more than $33 million through eBay for Charity. In addition, the eBay Foundation issued grants to 50 nonprofit organizations that support inclusive entrepreneurship in communities around the world. These purpose-driven efforts help us drive economic opportunity for all.\nFinally, we're excited to announce that tomorrow, we will be publishing our inaugural small business report. This report highlights our progress towards becoming a seller platform of choice. I've spoken to you in the past about how eBay creates access for entrepreneurs. And through our recent small business survey, we found that 7 out of 10 sellers say that eBay help them start their business. We are proud to partner with our sellers, helping them get up and running on our marketplace and providing the tools they need to build scale and grow their business. Sellers recognize these efforts with over half of all sellers surveyed strongly agreeing that eBay helped their small business grow.\nAs a third-party marketplace, eBay only wins when our sellers win. And we have earned trust from our seller community over time. In this report, 95% of sellers surveyed say they rely on eBay for their business with almost 1/3 saying their small business would not exist without eBay. This data helps to reinforce that the investments we are making reflect the role we play in creating and growing small businesses around the world.\nHaving just come off a number of large seller events in our major markets, we continue to be inspired by our seller community, and we are proud to play a key role in helping our customers navigate these challenging economic times. All of this couldn't be possible without our talented and dedicated teams who work so hard to innovate on behalf of our customers. Thank you to the eBay team for all you do every day for our community.\nIn closing, the resiliency of our platform yielded better-than-expected quarterly results despite a challenging macro backdrop. Focus categories grew over 7 points faster than the rest of the platform and maintained higher levels of customer satisfaction. We acquired TCGplayer and myFitment to better serve enthusiasts in 2 of our largest focus categories.\nSite-wide improvements in search, SEO and selling improved conversion rates. Advertising growth accelerated while delivering high returns on ad spend for our sellers. Payments innovation enabled more services and further reduced transactional friction, and we continue to support our small business sellers, helped raise $33 million for charity and drove close to $1 billion in economic impact through e-commerce. All of these accomplishments contributed towards our long-term, tech-led re-imagination of eBay.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nSenior VP & CFO, eBay Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the third quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll walk through our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter with some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I announce otherwise.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our third quarter results as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives while efficiently navigating the challenging short-term macro environment. Our GMV revenue and non-GAAP EPS each came in above expectations and surpassed the high end of our guidance ranges.\nGross merchandise volume declined 5%, improving nearly 9 points sequentially. Revenue was down 2% to approximately $2.4 billion, outpacing volume by nearly 4 points, primarily due to continued momentum within our advertising business.\nNon-GAAP operating margin is 28.9%, up modestly quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in our strategic pillars. We delivered $1 of non-GAAP earnings per share of 11% over the prior year. And we generated $633 million of free cash flow, while returning $421 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends. Our Q3 results highlight the strength of our scaled marketplace, durability of our financial model and impact of our tech-led re-imagination on eBay's underlying growth trajectory.\nLet's take a closer look at the drivers of our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 5% year-over-year, but accelerated nearly 9 points sequentially as easier comps offset the tougher macro environment in Q3. The war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to wear on consumer confidence and demand for discretionary goods. In addition, recent currency volatility widened the FX headwind to our reported GMV growth to approximately 6 points in Q3 compared to roughly 4 points in the prior quarter.\nDespite these headwinds, our business remains resilient and markedly healthier than when we entered the pandemic, boosted by returns from our investments with focus category and site-wide innovation across the eBay platform.\nOur focus on non-new-in-season goods have multiple benefits. It aligns us with the fastest-growing portion of our TAM and extends the life of products. It also makes our marketplace more durable during periods of economic turbulence. Preowned, refurbished, open box and vintage goods are attractive alternatives to brand new items of value orientating buyer. eBay scale global demand for these goods, provides supplemental income to seller, which can mitigate the burden of the rising cost of living.\nPreowned and refurbished goods alone make up over 1/3 of our GMV, and are growing significantly faster than brand new goods on eBay in recent years. Brand disparity has become more pronounced since the onset of macro weakness observed. GMV from the used and refurb goods has maintained double-digit growth versus 2019 since the start of the pandemic, even if demand for discretionary goods has been pressured in recent quarters.\nOur focus category strategy continue to drive underlying growth in our business during Q3. Excluding trading cards, focus category GMV outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by over 7 points year-over-year, has increased more than 20% versus 2019. In aggregate, our marketplace grew 6% versus Q3 of 2019, primarily driven by faster growth in focus category, but also supported by relatively stable volume in other categories.\nIt's important to note we've been seeing compelling evidence that other categories are benefiting from our strategy as well. Higher customer satisfaction and focus categories raises trust across the eBay platform. [We see actual] engage in cross-category shopping provide a multiplier effect for our business.\nThe site-wide product improvements have alleviated friction to sellers and buyers across our marketplace. Even amidst the challenging macro environment, our GMV and other categories in Q3 was roughly flat versus the same period in 2019.\nLooking at our business on a geographic basis. Our U.S. GMV grew 17% compared to Q3 of 2019, or more than 2 points faster than Q2, aided by slightly easier comps. International GMV was down 3% over the same period, roughly in line with Q2.\nAlthough the macro headwinds I outlined earlier are weighing on the most global economies, the effects are more pronounced in Europe through September. Consumer confidence remains near historic lows across most of our largest markets. European consumers remain even more cautious as they face significant energy price hikes. The labor strikes accompanied by rising cost of living also threaten the near-term outlook.\nDespite these headwinds, growth in focus category volume modestly outpaced other categories internationally in Q3. eBay's strong value proposition and past successes end up taking countercyclical leap for our products, contributed to this delta. However, the economic situation in Europe has also fueled strength in other categories, which now is a relative growth gap in Q3. For example, demand for home energy products in Germany has temporarily surged as consumers cope with rising utility prices and the uncertainty of energy availability at the heavy winter months.\nMoving to active buyers. 135 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months, including 2 million buyers from our Turkish business, where we ceased operations in July. Active buyers, excluding TÃ¼rkiye, were down 2 million quarter-over-quarter, a more modest step down in prior quarters.\nNotably, up to 90% of our buyers, who churned in Q3 were low-value buyers. Enthusiast buyers accounted for approximately 17 million of our active buyers in Q3. Downward migration between the enthusiast and mid-value buyer groups decelerated as lapping headwind. Macro pressure may continue to cause migration between buyer groups in the short term. An average spend per user grew sequentially and continues to be healthy at over $3,000 per year, up double digits versus 2019.\nTurning to revenue. Net revenue was down 2% to approximately $2.4 billion during the third quarter, an acceleration of nearly 5 points compared to Q2. Our transaction take rate was 12.8% due to this, an increase of nearly 40 basis points sequentially and close to 100 basis points versus the prior year.\nAdvertising was the primary driver of our take rate increase, both sequentially and year-over-year. Recent foreign currency volatility was also a significant driver of the increase versus Q2 as we reported GMV growth is more impacted by FX headwinds than revenue due to our hedging practices.\nTotal advertising revenue grew 22% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 27%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points. This marked an acceleration of more than 10 points versus the GMV data in Q2 as both Promoted Listings and total ads reflect the double-digit growth we have anticipated.\nThis strong result was primarily driven by continued optimization of our Standard Promoted Listings product, along with ramping contributions from our newer ad products, which continue to grow adoption and evolve their capabilities.\nAlthough our ad growth benefited from some onetime changes and a significant portfolio expansion this year, we are pleased that our ad business remains on track to roughly double by 2025, despite a tougher macro environment that we have contemplated back in March. As expected, advertising surpassed managed payments as a primary driver of our take rate growth and the payment migration is nearly complete in Q3 of last year. Payments contributed roughly 10 basis points of our sequential take rate increase due to the ramp of new payment services. We are pleased these additional services remain on track to meet the $300 million target that we (inaudible) invest that.\nMoving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 28.9% in Q3, up nearly 30 basis points sequentially, but down close to 3 points year-over-year. Gross margins were roughly in line with the prior year, while sales and marketing and product development were notable areas of investment as we continue to invest in our focus categories and site-wide product improvements.\nWe delivered $1 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3, up 11% which is ahead of expectations due to volume upsizing cost efficiency. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $0.13, primarily driven by losses on our investment portfolio due to ongoing market volatility.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 26% to $633 million in Q3, largely due to the timing of working capital items. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $4.8 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion.\nWe repurchased roughly $300 million of shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3, and have more than $3.1 billion remaining into our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $120 million in September, or $0.22 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned over $3.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends, or roughly double our free cash flow. Although our share repurchases are elevated during the first half of the year due to our excess cash position, our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged.\nEarlier this week, we closed our acquisition of TCGplayer ahead of schedule for a total consideration of up to $295 million in cash. We are excited to have the team on board and expect them to accelerate innovation in our collectibles category.\nOur investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 19 of our investor presentation. Our equity investment stake provided approximately $3 billion at the end of Q3. Our $405 million Adevinta shares was valued at roughly $2.4 billion. We sold the remainder of the Adyen shares acquired through the first tranche of warrants for approximately $120 million in Q3. Our remaining Adyen investment is calculated based on the estimated value of our remaining warrant tranches. As always, we continue to manage our investment portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value.\nMoving on to our outlook. Despite our resilient performance in Q3, the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. Consumer confidence remains near historic lows across our major markets, while the effects of the energy crisis in Europe may worsen as temperatures fall during the fourth quarter. Recent and upcoming Royal Mail strikes in the U.K. and other industry workforce disruptions across the region has incremental risk during the holiday. And despite the relative strength of the U.S. consumer through September, prolonged exposure to decades-high inflation appears to be softening demand domestically as well.\nIn October, growth in our U.S. volume slowed by several points versus our 2019 data. In addition, recent declines in the euro and sterling led to an incremental FX headwind of approximately $300 million in Q4 GMV versus our prior outlook. Our hedging program should mitigate much of the incremental FX impact to revenue, operating income and EPS within the fourth quarter.\nFor Q4, we now expect to generate between $17.5 billion and $18.1 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline between 9% and 6% with an FX headwind to spot growth of roughly 7 points. We anticipate revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.5 billion, equating to a decline between 4% and 1% year-over-year.\nWe forecasted non-GAAP operating margin between 29.7% to 30.3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.09, which were negative 2% and positive 4% year-over-year growth. For the duration of severity of the current macro headwinds remain as certain, recent trends suggest it's increasingly likely that will represent a meaningful headwind to our business well into the coming year.\nAdditionally, if the strength of the U.S. dollar is a hold at today's rates, FX would represent an estimated headwind of 3 points to year-over-year GMV growth 2022. We would also face a 5- to 6-point headwind in non-GAAP earnings per share next year.\nIn closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS, despite an increasingly challenging macro environment. Our marketplace remains resilient in the face of inflationary pressures. And our non-new-in-season focus enables to offer consumers low-cost alternatives to brand new products. Our advertising business accelerated meaningfully, while new payment services are scaling in line with expectations, providing incremental capacity for investments.\nOur fortress balance sheet, differentiated scale and durable financial model enable us to mitigate the margin impact of recent macro pressure, protect investments in our core strategic initiatives and generate healthy earnings and cash flow. And we've returned roughly double our free cash flow to shareholders through repurchasing dividends this year, alongside inorganic investments to accelerate our strategy.\nFinally, I'm incredibly appreciative of how our employees have maintained their focus and support of our community during this challenging time. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the eBay Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Joe Billante, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nJoe Billante\n\nVP of IR, eBay Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the second quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Jamie's and Steve's commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Additionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie's and Steve's remarks represent FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons, unless they indicate otherwise.\nIn this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of August 3, 2022, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this year, during our Investor Day, we updated you on the progress of our tech-led reimagination and outlined our vision for the future. I'm really excited about the pace at which our challenger teams are delivering against that plan.\nOur focus category playbook is working. Enthusiast buyers are spending more, and advertising and payments continue to grow. This quarter, we launched several key innovations in line with our long-term objectives. These ongoing efforts have put eBay in a stronger position today than it was when we entered the pandemic.\nI'm pleased to say that during the second quarter, we delivered better than expected financial results across the board. We delivered over $18.5 billion in GMV and over $2.4 billion in revenue. We continue to invest in marketing and product while achieving close to 29% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS was $0.99.\nOur focus category, payments and advertising initiatives, helped offset the impact of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a more uncertain macro environment. Looking ahead, we remain on track to deliver on our full year commitments, and we'll continue to invest and manage towards sustainable long-term growth. Later in the call, Steve will go into more detail about our outlook.\nOne of the most important pillars of our long-term plan is our focus category strategy. Investments in trust, product experience and marketing are increasing customer satisfaction, leading to faster volume growth. Last quarter, excluding trading cards, focus category's GMV grew 9 points faster than the rest of the platform. Trading cards are lower than last year's stimulus-fueled results, but volume remains robust at more than double pre-pandemic levels.\nWe are seeing significant outperformance in focus categories globally, although the U.S. is higher than international. The primary reasons for the difference are the timing of launches and category mix by market.\nIn markets where we've implemented these changes, customer satisfaction remains at or near best-in-class levels. The vast majority of our enthusiast buyers shop in focus categories and their spending levels remain above $3,000 per year. We continue to see cross-category shopping activity consistent with data we shared during Investor Day in March.\nOne of our largest focus categories is parts and accessories, which is one of the highest buyer NPS scores on the platform. We know from experience how crucial trust is, and fitment is one of the best enablers of trust. To ensure every buyer finds the perfect part to fit their vehicle, we are enhancing all of the AI that powers search, merchandising and advertising.\nIn addition, we have rolled out more ways for P&A enthusiasts to discover the wide range of inventory on eBay. In our international markets, we have added over 100,000 fitment-based browse pages last quarter alone. We also expanded our supply of OEM and certified green parts. To drive demand to our huge supply of P&A inventory, we continue to invest in full-funnel marketing. Initial consideration is showing encouraging early signs, and we see further opportunity to attract more enthusiasts.\nAcross other focus categories, we took several steps over the past quarter to expand coverage. To enhance our leadership position in trading cards, we expanded authentication services to a wider range of graded items. In addition, we rolled out a new feature where enthusiasts can now use the popular [My Collections] tool to track a broader set of inventory, including sports trading cards.\nIn eBay Refurbished, we added more trusted sellers and expanded categories in the program. These included headphones, audio, gaming consoles and smart home devices. Refurbished products are growing faster than new products in the same category, in part due to increased customer satisfaction.\nAnd in sneakers, we added more products to our catalog, which now includes the top 40 brands across our 4 largest markets. This expansion reduces friction in selling and buying experiences. We also started authenticating handbags in Germany and handbag accessories such as wallets in the U.S.\nThe next focus category where we are innovating and changing the customer experience is jewelry. Recently, we launched authentication for eligible new and preowned jewelry items over $500. We are partnering with GIA, the Gemological Institute of America, who bring 90 years of experience to our partnership. Like other focus categories, we will improve the product experience, increase customer satisfaction and change how we market to jewelry enthusiasts over time. I am pleased with the near-term progress in focus categories, and we remain on track to expand coverage and drive growth back towards market rates.\nEqually important is evolving our capabilities to attract the next generation of enthusiast buyers. In Q2, we took several steps toward that objective. In June, we marked an important milestone with the opening of the eBay vault. This state-of-the-art facility enables a new format for sellers and buyers to trade and build their collections in real time. The vault is initially accepting graded authenticated trading cards above $500 and will expand to more products over time. Sellers are taking advantage of an initial year of free storage and no selling fees for vault sales. This innovation will help us transform many product categories.\nOne reason that we're excited to launch the vault is because it can enable real-time transactions for physical or digital goods. This intersection is nascent, the one that collectibles enthusiasts are increasingly exploring. This is part of the rationale behind our second quarter acquisition of KnownOrigin. KnownOrigin is an NFT platform that enables artisan collectors to create, buy and resell NFTs via blockchain-supported transactions. Their team is highly talented and has extensive technical experience in this rapidly evolving space. They were one of the early pioneers of NFTs and are a perfect fit to make eBay the destination to collect and trade.\nIn the second quarter, we also began to experiment with live commerce. Although Western market adoption of live shopping remains low, we are optimizing our user experience ahead of this emerging trend. Early pilots have seen users engage, on average, for 15 minutes at a time, with approximately 1/4 of them interacting directly with the event. We will continue to optimize this capability in future quarters. The vault, NFTs and live commerce were all long-term strategic opportunities that we mentioned at Investor Day, and I'm pleased that in a few short months, we are already making progress in these areas.\nCustomers are also seeing rapid improvements in payments capabilities where we continue to build out new services for sellers and buyers. For example, we rolled out additional forms of payment popular with German buyers, especially Gen Z. Through our partnership with Klarna, consumers can now pay upon invoice or in installments. We also expanded our Buyer FX program, which allows eBay buyers to purchase in the currency of their choice. Recently, we expanded this global service from 8 currencies to over 30 currencies. To date, we have seen over 60% adoption on related transactions. These new services are reducing transactional friction for sellers and buyers while delivering incremental revenue to eBay.\nAdvertising is also driving growth through innovation. Despite the macro environment, ad rates and adoption continue to grow due to the high return on ad spend that sellers experience on eBay. In Q2, our ads business accelerated faster than volume and delivered revenue that was nearly 1.5% of GMV.\nPromoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue to $232 million, up 6%. This was 20 points faster than GMV growth. Our largest product, Standard Promoted Listings, grew in the quarter due to conversion optimization and pricing changes. Our 3 newer advertising products that we launched last year grew almost 30% versus Q1. The largest contributor was Promoted Listings Advanced, which saw increased seller adoption and exposure. Our advertising business remains on track with the long-term goals we outlined at Investor Day, and we anticipate that Promoted Listings will return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters.\nESG is a major focus for the eBay team. And during the quarter, we made steady progress on our commitments in this space. E-commerce continues to be a huge volume driver on eBay. As we've shared before, non-new-in-season inventory is driving the vast majority of volume on the platform. In particular, demand for refurbished and used goods is growing in many categories. And we are well positioned to hit our long-term recommerce goals.\neBay has a tremendous impact on the economy beyond our own results. As mentioned in our most recent Impact Report, in the U.S. alone, eBay supports more than 1 million jobs. The vast majority of these jobs come from small and micro business entrepreneurs selling on the platform. Another meaningful economic impact comes from the generosity of our community. eBay for Charity allows sellers and buyers to make a positive difference in the world. During the quarter, eBay for Charity raised nearly $56 million, up 52% year-over-year. And Q2 marked the Finale Power of One Charity Auction with Warren Buffett, raising over $19 million. Over almost 2 decades, these auctions have raised more than $53 million for GLIDE, a nationally recognized center for equity. I'm truly inspired by the continued generosity powered by our marketplace.\nFinally, the team and I are honored to have received multiple prestigious awards this quarter. We were recognized as one of LinkedIn's top companies in retail, and we received 3 Women's Choice Awards in the consumer Internet category: Best Companies for Diversity, Best Companies for Women and Best Companies for Millennials. I am proud to be in a team that focuses so heavily on the impact we are making in the lives of our employees, our customers and our communities.\nIn closing, Q2 was a strong quarter for eBay. We delivered better-than-expected short-term results while marking several important milestones towards our long-term vision. GMV, revenue and EPS for Q2 all exceeded consensus estimates. Focus categories outperformed the rest of the marketplace by 9 points, excluding trading cars. We maintained high NPS scores from enthusiast buyers who spend more per buyer.\nCoverage extended to more refurbished products and new categories like jewelry. We launched the eBay vault, a game-changing capability that will enable the future of collecting. We acquired KnownOrigin to accelerate our connections between physical and digital.\nOur payments team scaled our Buyer FX capabilities, further simplifying cross-currency transactions and rolled out Klarna to German customers. Our advertising business accelerated faster than volume, putting Promoted Listings on a trajectory to a double-digit growth in the coming quarters. And eBay for Charity raised nearly $56 million, including a record-breaking Power of One Auction with Warren Buffett.\nBefore I hand over to Steve, I want to thank our amazing team who has continued to work hard innovating and exceptional experience for our customers around the world. They are delivering high-quality products and technologies that are translating into higher NPS scores and driving long-term growth for the company. To our sellers, thank you for continuing to partner with us. Your feedback is extremely valuable and helps us create trusted, reliable and frictionless experiences.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nSenior VP & CFO, eBay Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll show our outlook for the remainder of the year and add some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I announce otherwise.\nOverall, I'm incredibly proud of our teams for delivering strong results amid some of the most challenging macroeconomic conditions in recent memory. Our Q2 GMV revenue and non-GAAP EPS each exceeded expectations and topped the high end of our guidance range.\nOur second quarter revenue was down 6% to over $2.4 billion, outpacing volume growth by approximately 8 points due to contributions from payments and advertising. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, down nearly 4 points sequentially due to volume deleverage and the seasonality of marketing spend. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $0.99 per share, in line with the prior year. And we generated $466 million of free cash flow and returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our strong Q2 results are a testament to the focus and dedication of our employees and the durability of our marketplace and financial model during periods of macro uncertainty.\nLet's take a closer look at the drivers of our financial performance in Q2. Gross merchandise volume declined 14% as we lapped the elevated mobility restrictions in 2021. We also contended with a more challenging macro environment this year due to the conflict in Ukraine, ongoing supply chain challenges and rising inflation across our major markets. In spite of these headwinds, we saw volumes remain relatively stable as we progressed through the quarter, with GMV growing 5% versus our pre-COVID baseline in Q2 of 2019.\nWe continue to scale our investments in long-term growth initiatives and observe proof points demonstrating our strategy is working. Excluding trading cards, focus categories outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by 9 points, driven by the continued evolution of the product experience on eBay and growing awareness of our seller's unique high-quality inventory.\nMoving to active buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers were 138 million during the quarter, down roughly 4 million sequentially due to the lapping of mobility restrictions during 2021. We announced the wind-down of our Turkey business in June, which contributed nearly 4 million active buyers in Q1. These buyers would gradually roll off our total count over the next few quarters. Excluding Turkey, active buyers would have been 135 million in Q2. Importantly, disclosure will not materially impact our financials moving forward.\nEnthusiast buyers made up approximately 17 million of our active buyers in Q2. As we noted at Investor Day, we expected some movement between the enthusiasts and mid-value buyer groups in 2022 due to the lapping of elevated spending from mobility restrictions and stimulus last year.\nNotably, over 99% of last quarter's enthusiasts continue to be active buyers on eBay. Of those buyers migrating downward, the vast majority remains in our mid-value group, only between $200 and $800 per year. And importantly, average spend among enthusiast buyers grew sequentially and remains over $3,000 annually, up double digits versus 2019, demonstrating the robust demand among this lower group of eBay shoppers.\nLooking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV grew 15% compared to Q2 of 2019, while international GMV was down 3% over the same time period. The growth differential between our U.S. and international markets was exacerbated by recent macro and geopolitical developments as our European markets have been more meaningfully impacted given their proximity to Ukraine.\nThe U.S. also benefited from stronger economic growth, leading up to the Ukraine conflict, while our international markets were more exposed to the supply chain challenges impacting cross-border trade. Encouragingly, our focus categories are outperforming the rest of the marketplace on a global basis, demonstrating our innovation playbook is working across regions, although the level of outperformance is slightly higher in the U.S. due to the timing of launches and the relative category mix.\nTurning to revenue. Net revenue in Q2 was over $2.4 billion, down 6% due to the lapping of mobility restrictions last year and the intensifying macro headwinds over the last few months. However, revenue outpaced GMV growth at roughly 8 points due to positive contributions from payments and advertising. As a result, our transaction take rate increased to 12.4% versus 12.1% in Q1.\nTotal advertising revenue grew 4%, while first-party ads grew 6%, outpacing volume by approximately 20 points. This represents an acceleration versus Q1, driven by continued optimization of our Standard Promoted Listings product, the growing scale, adoption and sophistication of our newer ad products and healthy returns on ad spend across our portfolio. We are extremely pleased with the momentum in our ads business and expect Promoted Listings revenue to return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters.\nManaged payments contributed roughly 4 points of revenue growth during the quarter. Payments revenue remained comfortably above a $2 billion run rate despite recent volume pressure as new services like Buyer and Seller FX are scaled in line with expectations. These new payment services remain on track to achieve the $300 million revenue target we discussed at our Investor Day.\nMoving to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 28.7% in Q2, down roughly 4 points sequentially, primarily driven by top line deleverage and the advancement of our full-funnel marketing strategy. We also continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our focus categories and horizontal marketplace improvements. Our G&A expense includes exit costs related to the wind-down of our Turkey business, which offset lower employee-related costs in the quarter.\nWe delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in Q2, which was in line with our prior year and above our outlook for the quarter. The lapping of COVID-driven volume tailwinds in the prior year was offset by cost efficiencies, better-than-expected volume and the net benefit of share repurchases during the quarter. A portion of the EPS upside was driven by the timing of our expense run. We continue to invest in our long-term plan despite the short-term macro uncertainty. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $0.96, primarily driven by losses in our investment portfolio due to ongoing market volatility.\nTurning to capital allocation. We generated $466 million of free cash flow in Q2 by nearly 50% due to the lapping of onetime working capital benefits associated with the managed payments migration and lower volume versus the prior year. We ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $4.5 billion, along with gross debt of $7.7 billion after redeeming $605 million of notes during the second quarter.\nWe repurchased $1.3 billion of shares at an average price of approximately $51 during Q2 and have more than $3.4 billion remaining under our current authorization. We also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $121 million in June or $0.22 per share. Our repurchase have reduced outstanding shares by roughly $45 million over the last 2 quarters net of dilution. Despite the dynamic macro environment, we remain balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. The launch of the eBay vault, our investments in Funko, the acquisition of KnownOrigin and our PSA authentication partnership are a few recent examples of our build, buy, partner framework, helping us accomplish strategic objectives.\nOur investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20. Equity investment stakes were valued at approximately $4 billion at the end of Q2. We sold roughly $370 million in aggregate of Kakao Bank and Adyen shares during the second quarter, while market volatility impacted the value of our remaining stake. We'll continue to manage our investment portfolio with an intent of maximizing shareholder value. You'll see additional detail on our share sales and remaining investment holdings in our 10-Q.\nMoving on to our outlook. Our business has remained resilient in recent months despite escalating macro headwinds, but the operating environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. The spread of COVID variants, persistent supply chain issues, elevated inflation and the impact of rising interest rates will likely wear on consumers' discretionary spend for some time. The duration and severity of the economic impact from the Ukraine war and related sanctions are even more challenging to anticipate.\nGiven our outperformance in Q2 and relatively stable volume trends as we progress through the quarter, we are maintaining our outlook for an FX-neutral GMV decline between 12% and 10% for the full year. While we land in that range, we'll likely be determined by whether the current macro headwinds hold steady, intensify or subside.\nAdditionally, recent currency movements relate to an incremental FX headwind of roughly $500 million to 2022 GMV versus our prior outlook. On a spot basis, our guidance translates to full year GMV between $72.7 million to $74.7 billion. Our hedging program should help us mitigate the incremental FX impact to revenue, operating income and EPS.\nOur revenue outlook for 2022 remains unchanged of between $9.6 billion and $9.9 billion, represents an FX-neutral decline of between 6% and 3% or 6 or 7 points faster than volume growth. We also maintain our non-GAAP operating margin target of between 29% and 30% for the full year. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $3.95 and $4.10, raising the low end of our prior range by $0.05.\nLooking to Q3 guidance. We actually generate between $17 billion and $17.6 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline of between 9% and 6%. We anticipate revenue between $2.29 billion and $2.37 billion or a decline of between 5% and 2%. We forecast a non-GAAP operating margin of between 27% and 28% as we continue to invest in our marketing and product experience initiatives to support focus categories and horizontal marketplace innovation. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.89 and $0.95, representing growth of negative 1% and positive 6%.\nIn closing, Q2 was a strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations across all key financial metrics despite facing challenging macro headwinds in recent months. Our fortress balance sheet and durable financial model put us in a fortunate position to continue investing in long-term growth initiatives while delivering robust earnings and free cash flow amidst an uncertain macro environment.\neBay's track record of shareholder-friendly capital allocation continued as we returned over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and cash dividends this quarter. Our advertising and payments teams continue to innovate with new services and capabilities, which are driving revenue in excess of volume growth at healthy incremental margins.\nAnd I'm particularly proud of our team's focus and financial discipline, which has enabled us to remain on track to reach our ambitious impact goals and carbon reduction targets during this period of economic uncertainty. Fostering sustainable business practices and enabling equitable inclusive entrepreneurship have never been more important than they are today. Finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated eBay employees for continuously striving to deliver a better future for our customers, our global community and our planet.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Billante, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Billante\n\nVP of IR, eBay Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the first quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Jamie and Steve's commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Additionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie's and Steve's remarks represent FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise.\nIn this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecasts for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q in our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of May 4, 2022, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our first quarter results, I want to acknowledge the terrible human tragedy that continues to unfold in Ukraine. This is a very difficult time for many, and I'm proud of how eBay employees and customers have mobilized to support those affected. At our core, eBay exists to help people and communities around the world. This role is fundamental to our purpose and motivates our workforce. In addition to direct and indirect support for refugees and citizens, we will continue policy actions to help customers in the region.\nThese events have had a negative impact on consumer health, primarily in European markets. Despite this unexpected headwind, our global results for Q1 were strong.\nLet me highlight a few achievements from the quarter. Focused category innovation expanded, and these categories continue to grow faster than the rest of the marketplace. 18 million enthusiast buyers continue to shop regularly on eBay, purchasing items over 30 times per year. Sellers are seeing a simpler unified listing experience, and we made several improvements to eBay stores in the quarter. We announced a deal with Klarna to provide more popular payment methods to German buyers, and we started testing the new eBay wallet.\nOur advertising business grew faster than GMV due to increased optimization and adoption of new products. And finally, we made significant progress on our e-commerce, DE&I and sustainability goals. Sellers and buyers are turning to eBay, and this led to financial results at the high end of our expectations. We delivered over $19.4 billion in GMV and close to $2.5 billion in revenue. We continue to make the long-term investments laid out at Investor Day while achieving a 32% operating margin. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1.05, $0.02 ahead of consensus.\nGiven the challenges our customers are facing around the world, we are pleased with our performance to start the year. Since late February, when the war in Ukraine began, we have seen lower e-commerce traffic, inflation in gas prices and home energy costs and historically low consumer confidence, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. As we look forward to the rest of 2022, we find ourselves in the most dynamic macro environment I have seen since returning to eBay as CEO. We expect more near-term headwinds to e-commerce growth rates this year, and our revised guidance reflects our best year based on recent trends. Steve will go into more detail about our full year expectations later.\nDuring these uncertain times, one thing that remains clear is that the tech-led reimagination is improving the underlying health of our business, and we are on track towards our long-term growth targets. One example is in focus categories. The investments in trust, user experience and marketing are driving higher customer satisfaction, leading to faster GMV growth. In Q1, excluding trading cards, focused category GMV grew 9 points faster than the rest of the platform. This growth is on top of last year's stimulus-driven surge, which drove exceptional volume in many high ASP products.\nDespite challenging year-over-year comps, trading cards remains one of our healthiest growth businesses. In the first half of 2021, we saw an unprecedented surge boosted by mobility restrictions and stimulus. Since that time, volume has remained elevated. And in Q1, GMV was more than double the size of pre-pandemic levels.\nAs a leading trading cards platform, we continue to innovate our experience to increase trust between buyers and sellers. In Q1, we launched authenticity guarantee for ungraded cards above $750. Just this week, we expanded authentication to graded cards by signing a strategic partnership with PSA, the global leader in trading card grading and authentication. We expect this partnership will increase customer satisfaction and result in more GMV growth.\nWe are incredibly excited for the launch of the Vault this quarter, which will transform our Collectibles business. Items in the Vault will be able to securely transfer between sellers and buyers in a matter of seconds without the need to ship or the need to reauthenticate. We see an opportunity to hold up to $3 billion of inventory in our Vault in the next few years, creating significant GMV and revenue growth potential.\nLooking beyond Collectibles, we continue to expand coverage of focused categories to more products and markets. Let me share a few examples. At the end of March, we started authenticating high-value handbags in the U.K. and Australia. We also expanded the number of handbag brands covered by our authenticity guarantee and began to authenticate men's bags in the U.S.\nAnother focus area in Q1 was eBay Refurbished. After success with certified products direct from manufacturers, we have significantly expanded the program across smart watches, tablets, laptops and desktops. Now buyers can shop from sellers across a wide range of refurbished inventory backed by eBay's moneyback guarantee and warranties. These trusted products contribute to e-commerce, which saves consumers money and reduces carbon emissions.\nThe luxury watch category continues to grow at positive double-digit rates on top of last year's strong growth rate. To date, we have authenticated watches over $2,000 across 3 markets. This quarter, we added the ability for buyers to request expert verification for a fee for watches valued between $1,000 and $2,000. This additional service marks an important milestone in our journey to increase trust through authentication. This feature is portable to other categories and markets across the platform and demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of our playbook.\nIn our sneakers category, we reintroduced final value fees in the U.S. in January, and growth momentum continued. These fees are lower than most other platforms and customer satisfaction remains near historically high levels. Sneaker GMV is also growing significantly faster than the rest of the business in our international markets. We repeated the successful approach first deployed in the U.S., which includes authentication, influencer partnerships and increased social marketing investments.\nIn parts and accessories, supply chain constraints and low vehicle inventory are driving up the price of new and used cars. These trends are driving more consumers to extend the life of their current vehicles. With approximately 0.5 billion P&A listings, we are well positioned to supply all the parts they need. We have been investing in full funnel marketing for parts and accessories since December, and we are starting to see modest gains in initial consideration. This includes partnerships with leading influencers and enthusiasts to showcase our vast inventory selection. A recent example is the eBay Auto Parts Show in New York, where several top influencers showcased that restored in custom vehicles. These do-it-yourself enthusiasts crafted reconcept cars using unique and hard-to-find parts on eBay. This event generated 3 billion media impressions in 1 week, supporting the momentum we are seeing in the P&A category.\nWhile sellers and buyers love what we are doing in focused categories, we are also making site-wide enhancements to help all sellers grow their business. In Q1, we made several significant changes to further modernize our store's experience. First, our new storefront page provides sellers the ability to tell their story, showcase their brand and increase trust in their business. Second, we optimized SEO for stores to drive more free traffic. Third, we increased the prominence of store inventory and made it easier for enthusiasts to find stores throughout the buyer journey.\nTo support sellers and help them grow their buyer base, we also increased the ability for buyers to save sellers for future purchases. Now when buyers purchase items, they are prompted after checkout to save that seller. This has driven a 4x increase in the number of saved sellers to date, which leads to more purchase frequency. New buyers who save a seller in their first 90 days are more than twice as likely to repurchase an item.\nMore sellers are sending coded coupons to drive repeat purchases. To date, over 7.5 million buyers have purchased an item from a seller funded coupon, equating to approximately $500 million in GMV. To help sellers improve targeting, they can now categorize their buyers in unique groups for customized marketing campaigns.\nOur payments platform is enabling new services and reducing transactional friction for sellers and buyers. We signed an agreement with Klarna in early March, bringing 2 popular payment methods, pay upon invoice and installments, to our German buyers. Testing is underway, and we are on track to make it available to all German consumers this quarter.\nWe started testing and scaling other payment capabilities in Q1, including the new digital wallet we announced at Investor Day. When sellers earn money, that balance is stored on eBay and readily available for them to purchase items or pay for selling expenses like shipping labels. We will continue to optimize this feature and expand to more customers during the year.\nApproximately 1 in 5 transactions occurs across borders, and our payments platform is reducing friction on these purchases. In Q1, we started giving buyers the option to pay in their local currency in addition to the currency of the listing. This feature simplifies cross-border trade and also enables incremental payments revenue to fund further innovation.\nI'm excited by the pace of innovation in payments. After completing the migration last year, we are moving quickly to reduce friction, launch new services and leverage our scale to benefit sellers and buyers.\nAnother area where innovation is driving growth is our advertising. In Q1, our ads business once again outpaced volume. Ad revenue growth was driven by Promoted Listings, which generated $222 million in revenue, up 2%. This was 19 points faster than GMV, and it has accelerated due to product innovation. Our standard Promoted Listings product, which still drives most of our first-party ad revenue, continues to drive growth through increased adoption and conversion optimization. And we see further runway in the quarters and years ahead.\nThe 3 new products launched last year are early in the growth cycle but are up more than 50% versus Q4. The first product, Promoted Listings Express, is increasing conversion and price realization for auction sellers. A typical auction that leverages this feature is attracting several hundred more buyers per listing.\nThe second product, External Promoted Listings, is now open to our entire global seller base. Similar to standard Promoted Listings, sellers choose the value of their ad spend. We continue to expand the list of affiliate partners in the program to drive more traffic directly to sellers with Promoted Listings.\nThe third product, Promoted Listings Advance, while still limited data, has been scaled to more professional sellers. In Q1, we expanded the number of ad groups, providing more bidding capacity and flexibility. This product will take time to reach its full potential, and we see opportunities for significant growth. We are continuing to invest in our advertising platform and expect ad revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future.\nWe continue to make meaningful progress on ESG. Let me share a few highlights. Firstly, on recommerce. In 2021, our platform generated over $4 billion in positive economic impact from the sale of used and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to taking 300,000 cars off the road for a year. Recommerce on eBay is growing due to our focus on non-new and season categories. Demand for refurbished and used goods is growing in many categories, and we are well positioned to hit the long-term goals I shared with you at Investor Day.\nSecondly, I'm proud of our team's efforts around DE&I. We are about to publish our sixth annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. This report provides insights into our 4 strategic objectives: increased representation, cultivating a sense of belonging, engaging our communities and building inclusive technology. Aligning and executing on these objectives is how we build a richly diverse, truly equitable and fearlessly inclusive place to sell, buy and work.\nThe third area of progress I would like to highlight is reducing our impact on the planet. Last year, we set ambitious, long-term, science-based targets. For the full year 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 26% versus 2019. For Scope 3, which includes the impact of shipments on our platform, we reduced emissions by 7% versus 2019 despite volume growth. Lastly, 90% of our energy now comes from renewable sources, and we remain a carbon-neutral company. You can find more details about our sustainability programs and our annual impact report later this month.\nI'm always impressed by the generosity of our sellers and buyers. In Q1, eBay for Charity raised over $36 million, up 2%. We recently announced the grand finale of the Power of One charity auction with Warren Buffett. Since launching on eBay over 20 years ago, over $34 million has been raised to support GLIDE, a nationally recognized center for equity. The eBay Foundation, whose mission is to remove systemic barriers to entrepreneurship, committed $11 million to nonprofits in Q1. In addition, during March, over $2.4 million was raised from employee contributions and eBay Foundation matching gifts, many of which went to support Ukrainian relief efforts.\nAcross a number of other employee and customer channels, the company has raised millions of dollars for Ukraine-related causes. In several countries, customers contributed to give at checkout campaigns that supported the Red Cross, Nova Ukraine and Save the Children. We are very fortunate to work for a purpose-driven company with a team relentlessly focused on helping people and the scale to deliver meaningful impact to our communities.\nIn closing, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We extended focused category coverage in watches, handbags, trading cards and eBay Refurbished. And we laid the groundwork to launch the Vault this quarter, a game-changing experience for collectors. We released several new features for eBay store sellers like new store fronts and enhanced SEO. And we're encouraging more buyers to save their favorite sellers to drive repeat purchases.\nIn payments, we launched Klarna for German buyers, started testing a new digital wallet and increased currency payment options for cross-border buyers. Our advertising business is meaningfully outpacing volume growth through optimization and new product innovation. And we are achieving all of this while executing on an ambitious ESG agenda to support our communities and the world we live in.\nBefore I hand it over to Steve, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our seller and buyer community whose energy and unique inventory make our marketplace truly differentiated in e-commerce. I would also like to thank all of our global employees for their tireless efforts to delight customers and support our communities. Their dedication and focus are improving our underlying business health every day.\nLastly, I'm thrilled to welcome Eddie Garcia back to eBay as our new core product leader. His wealth of eBay knowledge and track record of innovation will be great assets to continue to drive the tech-led reimagination.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nSenior VP & CFO, eBay Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion with financial highlights on Slide 9 of our Q1 earnings presentation. Next, I'll provide a deeper look into key operating and financial metrics, including a discussion of our ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical developments influencing our business. Finally, I'll share our forward outlook and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. Please note, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons at constant currency, unless I note otherwise.\nOverall, we delivered strong results in Q1 as GMV, revenue and EPS met or exceeded expectations and performed near the high end of our outlook ranges. Our Q1 results were driven by continued progress against the strategic objectives we outlined at Investor Day, including an expansion in coverage and capabilities of our focused categories and improved technology for our sellers and buyers.\nOur first quarter revenue was down 5% to $2.48 billion, outpacing volume growth by approximately 12 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, up roughly 80 basis points sequentially. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share, down 2% as compared to a record quarterly EPS result last year. We generated $546 million of free cash flow and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nWe achieved these results despite some back-end softness, associated changing macro conditions and the tragic conflict in Ukraine. I'm extremely proud of our team's focus and execution amid these challenging circumstances.\nLet's take a closer look at our performance in Q1. Gross merchandise volume declined 17% as we lapped a 7 point sequential acceleration during 2021 and which was driven by global mobility restrictions and U.S. stimulus payments. As compared to our pre-COVID baseline in Q1 of 2019, GMV grew 7%. We were extremely pleased with the pace of growth, innovation and execution with our focused categories during Q1, coming off a record surge in growth in early 2021. Trading card volumes appear to be stabilizing at a quarterly run rate, more than double pre-COVID levels, indicating continued healthy demand in this asset class. Excluding trading cards, year-on-year growth in focused categories outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 9 points.\nWe sustained strong positive growth within our luxury categories compared with last year's stimulus-driven results, including sneakers over $100, where we reintroduced monetization in the U.S. in January. Trading 12-month active buyers were 142 million during the quarter, down roughly 5 million sequentially due to the same lapping dynamics. But importantly, this anticipated decline was skewed towards our low-value buyers. Trends within our high-value groups remained healthy as our 18 million enthusiast buyers spent an average of over $3,000 across 9 categories over the last 12 months. Average spend per enthusiast also rose sequentially and increased low double digits versus 2019.\nU.S. GMV grew 17% compared to Q1 of 2019, while international GMV was roughly flat. Similar to prior quarters, our U.S. volume benefited from stronger underlying e-commerce growth, beneficial category mix and earlier launches of focused category initiatives. Meanwhile, our international business has experienced softer economic growth and greater exposure to the supply chain challenges impacting cross-border trade. When we spoke at our March Investor Day, we were beginning to observe modest softness in our European markets during the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the conflict intensified in the weeks that followed. The headwinds to our business became more pronounced. We estimate the Ukraine war will represent a low single-digit negative impact to our global business in Q1. Notably, these macro headwinds have not impacted our product road map or other strategic initiatives.\nNet revenue during the quarter was $2.48 billion, down 5% with positive contributions from payments and ads, offset by comparisons with last year's extraordinary volume growth. Our transaction take rate increased by over 30 basis points sequentially to 12.1%. Managed payments contributed over 8 points of revenue growth during the quarter as we fully migrated to our proprietary platform, while new initiatives like buyer and seller FX are scaling in line with expectations.\nFirst-party ads primarily Promoted Listings grew 2% during Q1 and outpaced volume by approximately 19 points. This marked an acceleration from roughly 15 points in Q4 as we further optimized our standard Promoted Listings product and recent additions to our ads portfolio grew in scale and adoption.\nTurning to margins. We delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.4% in Q1, an increase of more than 80 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven by lower seasonal spend in sales and marketing, which was offset by volume deleverage as we lapped last year's GMV acceleration.\nDuring the first quarter, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, down 2% from our record quarterly EPS in Q1 of 2021. The impact of share repurchases and contributions from payments and ads were offset by the lapping of mobility tailwinds. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $2.28 with the delta driven by losses on our investment portfolio amid recent market volatility.\nWe generated $546 million of free cash flow in Q1, down 37% due to lower volume and the lapping of onetime working capital benefits associated with the managed payments migration, partly offset by lower cash taxes. As we discussed at Investor Day, we do expect our cash taxes to rise this year due to the timing of repatriation payments and new federal tax treatment of R&D credits. These dynamics are not muted to eBay, and we expect to revert to a more normalized cash tax rate after 2025.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $6.3 billion and gross debt of $8.3 billion as we paid down $750 million of notes during March. We repurchased $1.25 billion of shares during the quarter at an average price of approximately [$57]. This was in addition to a portion of shares from our Q4 accelerated share repurchase program that settled in early Q1. Additionally, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $129 million in March, representing $0.22 per share.\nOur investments are detailed on Slide 19. Our remaining portfolio is valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q1 after a quarter of significant market volatility. We sold roughly $600 million of Adyen and KakaoBank shares during Q1. We will continue to manage our investment portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value, which includes maintaining our investments when we believe we can generate incremental value for shareholders or monetizing them when we see an opportunity to do so. To that end, we sold Adyen shares during Q1 at an average price more than 7x the strike price of our first tranche.\nMoving to our outlook. Russia and Ukraine have historically made up less than 1% of our global volume, but the war in Ukraine has measurably impacted economic growth and consumer confidence throughout Europe and other parts of the world. This conflict arose as global economies were already contending with inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. On top of that, rising interest rates may further hinder near-term economic growth, while sanctions related to the war could raise already high fuel prices, additional pressure on consumer spending. We're confident our business will remain resilient in the current environment. We are revising our expectations for the remainder of 2022 to reflect the macro conditions we've observed over the last 2 months. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in our focused categories and other strategic initiatives to achieve the long-term growth targets we outlined at Investor Day.\nFor the full year, we are lowering our FX-neutral growth forecast for GMV by approximately 5%. The strengthening U.S. dollar also reduces our spot GMV outlook by roughly $1.3 billion versus our prior guidance. We now expect GMV of between $73.2 billion and $75.2 billion in 2022, representing a decline between 12% and 10%. We forecast revenue of $9.6 billion to $9.9 billion, representing a decline of between 6% and 3%. Our updated forecast operating margin between 29% and 30% as we expect to mitigate some macro-driven volume pressure through cost efficiencies. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.90 and $4.10, representing negative 3% to positive 2% growth.\nLooking to the second quarter, we expect to generate $18.02 billion to $18.42 billion of GMV, representing a decline between 16% and 14% or between 2% and 4% growth versus Q2 of 2019. We forecast revenue between $2.35 billion and $2.40 billion, representing a decline between 9% and 7%. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin between 26.5% and 27.5% as we scale our planned investments in product and marketing initiatives. And we project non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.87 and $0.91, representing a decline of between 12% and 8%.\nIn closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics despite facing a challenging confluence of geopolitical and macroeconomic developments in March. We expanded our coverage and capabilities within focused categories, which are delivering innovative new shopping experiences for our community and fueling positive underlying growth in our business. Advertising and payments initiatives are outpacing volume growth, delivering incremental revenue at healthy margins and helping eBay sellers grow their businesses.\nOur balanced approach to capital allocation enabled us to invest in strategic initiatives, maintain our best-in-class margins and return more than double our quarterly free cash flow to shareholders. And our focus on recommerce and sustainable accretive business process has enabled us to achieve these results while supporting our people, our purpose and our plan.\nFinally, I'd like to echo Jamie's thanks to our extraordinary eBay employees. Their focus and execution amid the challenges of the last few months has been truly inspiring. We continue to innovate and remain on track to deliver on the product road map we laid out at Investor Day.\nAnd with that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."

Welcome to the eBay Q4 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over your Presenter, Vice President, Investor Relations, Joe Billante. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nJoe Billante\n\nVP of IR, eBay Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the fourth quarter of 2021. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Steve's commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call.\nAdditionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie and Steve's remarks represent FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise.\nIn this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statements.\nAll information in this presentation is as of February 23, 2022, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJamie J. Iannone\n\nCEO, President & Director, eBay Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll begin by sharing highlights since our last earnings call. Then I will focus on the near-term progress we are making towards our strategic vision, and finally, provide a short preview of our Investor Day in 2 weeks. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.\nThe fourth quarter marked another solid quarter for sellers and buyers on eBay. They benefited from investments in our strategy to drive sustainable growth in our marketplace. We are simplifying the seller and buyer experience, increasing customer satisfaction and improving our underlying growth trajectory.\nLet me highlight a few achievements from the quarter. We are seeing faster GMV growth in focus categories that now represent approximately 20% of global volume. We successfully completed our multiyear payments transition on time with more customer benefits and with greater financial impact than expected. Our advertising business grew faster than marketplace volume as more sellers adopted new ad products. We delivered revenue growth at the high end of our expectations and earnings growth above guidance. And finally, we continue to execute our ESG agenda. In addition to being carbon-neutral, we made progress on our long-term sustainability targets, and eBay for Charity finished a record-breaking year.\nI'm very pleased with our Q4 financial results. We delivered 5% revenue growth on the back of payments migration and Promoted Listings growth. We also delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, more than the high end of expectations. For the full year, revenue was up 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 21%.\nAs proud as I am of our team for delivering these results, I am more excited about eBay's future based on the response from our customers to the strategy we are implementing. This is evident in focus categories. We are delivering best-in-class customer satisfaction, and it is leading to faster GMV growth. In Q4, focus categories grew 15 points faster than the rest of the marketplace.\nThe next category we are focus on is motors, parts and accessories or P&A for short. This is one of our largest categories globally and is full of enthusiasts who are passionate about what they trade on eBay. Many are very active buyers who shop in multiple categories, with over 60% of the eBay spend coming on products outside P&A.\nStarting in December, we began investing in top-of-funnel marketing across TV, radio and social sales in partnership with key industry influencers. These ads highlight the valuable choices P&A enthusiasts have on eBay across hundreds of millions of listings. In addition, we implemented monetization changes to higher-priced items and saw an increase in listings during Q4. We are leveraging the scale of our supply in new ways. With input from our P&A sellers, we simplified our global category structure. This makes it easier for buyers to find unique parts from around the world, unlocking more cross-border trade. These initial changes led to modestly better performance in P&A GMV during Q4 relative to the overall business. It's early days, and we plan to make further investments this year to improve our trajectory in this category.\nIn focus categories where we have been investing for several quarters, we have seen growth sustained at higher levels. Sneakers over $100 continued to grow double digits globally. Our success in the U.S. is being replicated in other major markets. Part of that success is authentication, which is scaled to 5 countries over the past year. And in Q4, we started authenticating cross-border transactions into the U.S.\nBut we are not stopping there. Last quarter, we acquired Sneaker Con, a leading authenticator with operations in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and Germany. By bringing additional capacity in-house, we increased the scale and flexibility of our operations. We also introduced 3D Tru-Vue on select listings. This capability increases trust for buyers shopping for unique, high-value preowned items.\nGiven our success in driving customer satisfaction to over 90% and sustained double-digit GMV growth, we have reintroduced monetization in the U.S. for sneakers over $100. The initial customer feedback has been encouraging as sellers continue to benefit from a lower take rate than many other platforms. Sellers are also listing more luxury watches on eBay. We saw a double-digit increase in supply quarter-over-quarter, and total GMV in this category continues to grow at strong double-digit rates in the U.S. In Germany and the U.K., authentication is also leading to higher customer satisfaction.\nIn luxury handbags, we saw acceleration in Q4 to positive double-digit growth in the U.S. Based on the success of authenticity guarantee, we are growing the number of brands covered by the program. In addition, we have expanded selection by authenticating cross-border imports from Japan, a key source of unique inventory. And just a few weeks ago, we announced authenticity guarantee for all single ungraded trading cards sold for over $750 in the U.S. We plan to expand this offering to include graded autograph and pass cars sold for more than $250 later this year.\nAs we exited 2021, our Certified Refurbished program had expanded to over 320 brands. This program now includes brands like Microsoft, Dyson, Samsung Galaxy and KitchenAid. And as a reminder, these products are certified by the manufacturer, are like new and are backed by a 2-year warranty and eBay's money back guarantee. Higher trust has increased customer satisfaction and accelerated GMV to positive double-digit rates. Certified Refurbished products from top brands make up a small percentage of the total refurb activity on eBay but are growing significantly faster. This has inspired us to expand further. And in November, we announced eBay Refurbished, a destination for like new products. This expanded experience adds more inventory from top-rated sellers. These trusted sellers are thoroughly vetted to meet rigorous performance standards so buyers can purchase with even greater confidence.\nIn Q4, we saw promising early results from this expansion in mobile phones and plan to extend to tablets, smart watches and laptops this year.\nIn addition to improvements in focus categories, we made a number of changes during Q4 that benefited sellers and buyers across all categories globally. We've started a pilot with our API sellers to add video to their listings. To date, we have seen hundreds of thousands of listings add video content. Buyers get a rich shopping experience on individual item pages and in seller stores. Looking ahead, we plan to enable more sellers to tell their story by adding videos through additional listing flows.\nAnother new growth capability we are scaling for sellers is coded coupons. Since launch, sellers have realized over $350 million in GMV. Over [60,000] sellers have driven (inaudible) purchases from almost 6 million buyers. Buyer trust is essential in a third-party marketplace and is an area of focus for our technology investment.\nIn Q4, we leveraged artificial intelligence to significantly decrease the time to detect and remove counterfeits. In the categories where it's been deployed to date, most listings are renewed before a buyer has a chance to see it. These are a few recent examples of how we are using technology to increase trust while simplifying seller and buyer experiences.\nMoving on to payments. In Q4, we completed the transition to a modern payments platform by migrating all remaining sellers away from the legacy system. This has resulted in a simpler seller experience, lower fees for most sellers, more choice for buyers and better-than-expected financial results. Although this marks the culmination of a major multiyear effort, in reality, this is just the beginning. By managing seller and buyer money flows, we can remove transactional friction and provide more trusted services. We've been systematically eliminating unpaid items, which removed friction for approximately 10 million transactions in 2021. In addition, sellers are being paid faster for weekend sales in most major markets.\nWe are also exploring new ways to allow sellers and buyers to benefit from our scale. In the U.S., we recently launched a partnership with Chase Freedom Rewards that increases top-of-funnel impressions, driving buyer traffic to eBay. We are excited by the value payments has provided our seller and buyer community, and we see more growth opportunities ahead.\nMoving to advertising. In Q4, ad revenue growth once again outpaced volume due to Promoted Listings, driving approximately $227 million in revenue, up 4%. Adoption grew at double-digit rates in both the number of sellers and the number of listings promoted. Looking at the full year, our advertising business, including both first-party and third-party ad products, surpassed $1 billion, up 9%. To drive the next growth cycle in advertising, we expanded the rollout of new products to more sellers and markets during the quarter.\nPL Express, our auction listings product, was fully launched to all major markets. We also integrated this feature into more listing tools to drive further adoption. For PL Advanced, our cost per click offering, we opened access to AI-driven recommendations for keywords and bid pricing. While this product remains in a limited beta as we optimize the customer experience, we are increasing exposure and streamlining reporting for sellers.\nFor external Promoted Listings, we continue to ramp more affiliate traffic through the eBay partner network. We also increased traffic from external paid search to Promoted Listings in European markets. Participating sellers are seeing increased traffic and conversion while maintaining control over ad pricing.\nWe have carefully needed the rollout of these new products while balancing impacts to our buyer experience. Despite the limited release, new ad products provide a material contribution to Promoted Listings revenue growth in Q4. We expect this to accelerate in the coming quarters as availability and adoption of these new product increases.\nAnother area where we made significant progress last year was in e-commerce. Volume of preloved products grew faster than new products in 2021 driven by demand from younger consumers. For the full year, we delivered $2.7 billion of GMV in preloved electronics and apparel in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\nIn addition to providing customers great value on unique used goods, e-commerce activity also helped to meet our sustainability goals. These purchases reduced carbon emissions by approximately 540,000 metric tons in 2021. eBay is a carbon-neutral company, and I'm thrilled by the recognition we recently received as a sustainability leader in e-commerce.\nFor the [third year] running, eBay has made the Dow Jones Sustainability world in North American indices, putting us in the top 10% of companies in our industry globally. eBay was also included in JUST Capital and CNBC's JUST 100 list. This list measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. When compared to nearly 1,000 companies, eBay ranked 88th overall and fourth in retail when it comes to minimizing our environmental impact. I'm really proud of the progress our team is making here.\nThe eBay community continues to demonstrate its tremendous generosity. In Q4, eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise almost $37 million, up 6%. And for the year, customers raised over $145 million, up 18%, the most raised since we started this program almost 20 years ago.\nLastly, we were honored this year to receive Glassdoor's 2022 Employees Choice Award. This award reflects anonymous feedback from current and former employees regarding topics such as crew opportunities, culture and values, and diversity inclusion just to name a few. We are truly honored to be recognized by the people who make eBay the company it is.\nNow I would like to talk about our upcoming Investor Day on March 10. In July of 2020, I outlined a clear vision of a winning strategy for the company. Since that time, we increased our focus on sellers and buyers, accelerated the pace of innovation, simplified the portfolio and revamped the leadership team. We also drove successful multiyear initiatives in payments and advertising, both of which exceeded ambitious targets. This unprecedented level of change in eBay all happened in parallel with a global pandemic that massively disrupted short-term consumer behavior. Their early results have demonstrated that our strategy is working, and the business is stronger than it was before the pandemic. Our focus categories are returning to market rates of growth. High-value buyers are growing, and they are spending more. We are (inaudible) by simplifying their experience, saving them money and providing tools to accelerate their growth.\nOur technology investments are driving a simpler and more sustainable marketplace. And along the way, our investors have been rewarded with strong earnings growth and significant capital returns.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about the next few years as we build on the momentum we have established. I look forward to introducing you to our world-class leadership team and sharing more about our plans, along with a few new initiatives we will unveil at Investor Day. We have our eyes squarely focused on deepening our relationship with sellers and buyers and building the world's most sustainable marketplace for the eBay community.\nIn closing, I would like to sincerely thank our extraordinary employees for an amazing year. They completed a huge payments transition, executed 2 large dispositions and improved the underlying growth of our business. While doing so, they delivered tremendous sustainability results and supported sellers and buyers during these challenging times.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\n\nStephen J. Priest\n\nSenior VP & CFO, eBay Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights from the quarter and full year on Slide 4 of our investor presentation. Next, I'll walk through key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our forward outlook and closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. Please note, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons at constant currency, unless I note otherwise.\nOverall, we are pleased with our Q4 results as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics, capping off an exceptional 2021 for eBay. I've been inspired by our team's relentless focus and execution amid uncertain economic and operating conditions throughout the year. Importantly, our performance in 2021 demonstrated the progress we have made towards a return to durable, sustainable growth in the years ahead.\nRevenue grew 5% to $2.6 billion in Q4, over 15 points faster than volume growth. For 2021, revenue grew 15% to $10.4 billion, up 18 points faster than volume growth. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter. For the full year, we generated approximately $3.5 billion of operating profit at 33.4% margin. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 24% to $1.05 in Q4. For the full year, EPS grew 21% to $4.02. We generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in 2021 and returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nLet's take a deeper look into our key operating and financial metrics. As a reminder, we adjusted our definition of GMV in December following the completion of our payments migration. The change had a modest impact on a historical GMV and active buyer figures, and the impact of the change on year-over-year growth for each metric in Q4 was immaterial.\nStarting with active buyers. We ended 2021 with 147 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 9% year-over-year decline. The expected decrease in active buyers was primarily driven by low-value buyers, which fell 9% versus Q4 of 2019. However, growth in high-value buyers over the same period was 3%. Although fewer buyers sold on eBay as compared to prepandemic levels, total high-value buyers were up due to growth in high spending and (inaudible) buyers. And importantly, even as mobility restrictions have been lifted, spend for high-value buyer continues to expand at healthy rates. Our buyers purchased $20.7 billion of GMV in Q4, which marked an 11% decline and landed near the high end of our outlook. Compared with Q4 of 2019, GMV grew 9% at constant currency, representing a 3-point deceleration sequentially. On a geographic basis, U.S. GMV grew 22% versus Q4 of 2019, while international GMV declined 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Our U.S. and international markets were impacted by softness in overall online shopping activity during the Cyber Five holiday period, but both geographies improved during the remainder of December. Consistent with prior quarters, numerous factors contributed to the growth differential between our U.S. and international markets.\nCore macroeconomic factors like GDP, retail growth and inflation have been notably stronger in the U.S. than our international markets. Other macro factors like global supply chain disruptions, shipping constraints and other export challenges have had a negative impact on growth in our international markets. These dynamics have particularly impacted sellers involved in cross-border trade, which skewed towards non-U.S. markets.\nConversely, our domestic sellers likely benefited from item scarcity due to supply changes. Our domestic GMV has benefited from momentum in collectibles, which is largely a U.S. phenomenon. In addition, high ASP luxury categories are growing faster in the U.S. as the rollout of our innovation playbook is more nascent internationally. However, as our luxury categories build momentum, we roll out product improvements in categories like P&A, which represent a higher share of GMV in international markets. Growth outside the U.S. should see greater benefit.\nOur focus category coverage expanded to approximately 20% of GMV as we made product improvements in P&A and broadened our country footprint and existing luxury categories. Focus categories outpaced growth in other categories by approximately 15 points in Q4, demonstrating the impact of our innovation playbook.\nNet revenue during the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 5%, while transaction revenue also grew 5%. Under our updated definition of GMV, our transaction take rate of 11.8% was roughly in line with Q3 as we completed the managed payments migration. Managed payments contributed 15 points of revenue growth in Q4 and generated $2 billion of incremental revenue in 2021, meeting our full year target. We remain excited about the potential for managed payments to open up new opportunities in financial services for our sellers and buyers.\nWithin our advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 4% during the quarter, outpacing volume by 15 points. As Jamie noted, we are encouraged by the progress of our new ad products, which began to gradually move the needle from Promoted Listings growth during the quarter.\nMoving down the P&L. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31.6%. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, increasing by close to 200 basis points versus 2019. This leverage was particularly notable given the incremental contribution from managed payments, which generates material operating profit, but is dilutive to reporting operating margins.\nCost of revenue rose by over 4 points as a percentage of revenue in Q4 year-over-year due to the variable payment processing costs from managed payments. With the migration behind us, we expect gross margin to stabilize around the current run rate in the short term with normal seasonal fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. Our other operating expenses declined by over 4 points in aggregate, roughly offsetting the decline in gross margin as payments revenue adds fewer fixed expenses.\nTurning to earnings per share. During the quarter, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, up 24%. Contributions from payments and advertising in conjunction with share repurchases offset the lapping of mobility tailwinds last year. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $1.47 due primarily to mark-to-market losses on our investment portfolio. We generated $372 million of free cash flow in Q4 and ended the year with cash and non-equity investments of $7.3 billion as well as gross debt of $9.1 billion. We repurchased $3 billion of shares during Q4, an average price of approximately $70 per share, with the majority of our buyback executed through accelerated share repurchase programs. Additional ASR details will be available in our 10-K filing. We also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $107 million in December, representing $0.18 per share.\nOur investments are detailed on Slide 13. After closing our Permira and career deals, which yielded approximately $5 billion in cash, our remaining investment portfolio was worth over $8 billion in aggregate at the end of Q4. Our remaining Adevinta shares were valued at $5.4 billion. We held approximately $1.1 billion of Adyen shares after exercising our first tranche of warrants during Q4. Including the estimated value of our remaining (inaudible) tranches, our total Adyen investment amounted to $1.5 billion. Our stake in (inaudible) Bank was worth roughly $700 million. And finally, the fair value of our nearly 20% ownership interest in G market in Korea was approximately $700 million.\nMoving to our outlook, beginning with the full year on Slide 14. To summarize, 2022 will be the tale of 2 halves. During the first half of the year, we'll lap significant mobility and macro tailwinds from 2021, with margins pressured as we scale investments sequentially. During the second half, we should observe the cleanest year-over-year comps we've encountered since entering the pandemic, revealing the underlying growth and earnings power of our business. For the full year, we forecast GMV to decline by 5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis, with an FX headwind of roughly 200 to 300 basis points to reported growth. We anticipate the GMV decline in the mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis during the first half as we lap a period of significant global mobility restrictions and the U.S. stimulus effects. In the second half, we expect flat to modestly positive GMV growth and anticipate exiting the year growing volume at 2% to 3% in constant currency. Notably, the quarterly phasing of our GMV should more closely approximate prepandemic seasonality moving forward, assuming mobility and macro factors remained relatively stable throughout the year.\nWe expect our 2022 take rate to expand by roughly 1 point driven primarily by a full year of managed payments and increased revenue contribution from Promoted Listings as we scale our new products. We forecast 2022 revenue of $10.3 billion to $10.5 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of flat to positive 3%. During the first half, we expect revenues to decline in the low to mid-single digits before reaccelerating in the second half to go in the mid- to high single digits. It comes in currency.\nAs we exit Q4, we expect the relationship between revenue and GMV to tighten as we fully lap the managed payments rollout. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of between 30% and 31% this year. The second quarter should mark the low point for margins during the year as we lap difficult comps and ramp up our pace of investment. Our investments in focus categories last year had a measurable positive impact on growth. Thus, we are doubling down on investments in products and (inaudible) funnel marketing initiatives in 2022, supporting these categories. We're confident these investments will improve customer satisfaction rates and drive sustainable growth in the years ahead.\nWe forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $4.20 and $4.40 in 2022. During the first half of the year, we expect EPS to be down low single digits year-over-year as we lap last year's outstanding growth and scale investments. However, the midpoint of our outlook implies EPS will grow in the high teens during the second half as GMV turns positive and revenue outpaces volume.\nOur Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion, bringing our total authorization to approximately $6 billion. We are also raising our quarterly dividend by 22% to $0.22 per share, our third consecutive double-digit raise since establishing our dividend in 2019.\nLooking at the first quarter guidance on Slide 15. We forecast revenue between $2.43 billion and $2.48 billion, representing a decline between 5% and 7% at constant currency. We expect our take rate to be roughly stable sequentially, implying GMV is down 17% to 19% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margins between 31.5% and 32% in Q1, up modestly versus Q4 at the midpoint of down 5 to 6 points year-over-year as we lap extraordinary volume leverage last year due to COVID. We project non-GAAP EPS between $1.01 and $1.05 in Q1, representing a year-over-year decline of 6% to a decline of 3%.\nIn closing, 2021 was an outstanding year for eBay. We delivered strong Q4 and full year results despite a challenging operating environment and certain macro conditions and constantly changing consumer behavior throughout the pandemic. Our focus categories meaningfully outpace overall volume growth due to increased customer satisfaction rates, offering demonstrable proof that our innovation playbook is working.\nWe generated $2 billion of revenue from managed payments this year after completing our migration and still see many more opportunities to leverage financial services to reduce friction to sellers and buyers on eBay. We delivered over $1 billion of advertising revenue this year and significantly broadened our ad portfolio to meet the needs of more sellers (inaudible) and grow their businesses on eBay.\nWe've made prudent investments in people, products and technology to support our strategic pillars. We believe these investments will drive durable growth in our marketplace in the years ahead. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 21% on top of strong earnings growth in the prior year, generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, unlocked billions more for our portfolio divestitures and returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nWe are proud to have taken meaningful steps to improve our environmental impact this year by achieving 100% carbon neutrality, setting ambitious science-based targets for the future and the continuous progress we are making as we focus on driving e-commerce and the circular economy as a whole.\nI would like to echo Jamie's (inaudible) to our incredible employee base as our tireless efforts have been instrumental in bringing our strategy to life. To our valued sellers and buyers in the eBay community, your response to our investments in trust and innovation give us conviction that we are on the right path. We are excited to reveal more details about our future road map very soon.\nTo the investment community, we appreciate your continued interest and look forward to hosting you at our virtual Investor Day on March 10.\nWith that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator?"

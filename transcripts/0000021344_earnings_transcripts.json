Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed.\nMedia participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Henrique Braun, our Chief Operating Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.\nYou can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report.\n[Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nCEO & Director, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the external environment remained dynamic. And in response, we adapted our plans as needed, focusing on sharper execution and investments to drive growth. With one quarter remaining in 2025, we're on track to deliver on our reiterated top line and bottom line guidance.\nWe also believe we're well positioned to achieve our longer-term commitments. This morning, I'll provide some context on how we're executing our all-weather strategy in the current operating environment. Then I'll pass the call to Henrique, who will discuss our segment performance and how we're working to unlock the full potential of our system. Finally, John will discuss financial details for the quarter, our guidance for the full year 2025 and some early considerations for 2026.\nDuring the quarter, the operating landscape remained complex. While many consumers remain in overall good shape, certain segments of the population are under pressure due to varying factors. Some factors are transitory like unseasonal weather. Others may be long-lasting, like the cumulative impact of inflationary pressures, uncertain trade dynamics and an ever-changing geopolitical environment.\nDespite this backdrop, we've delivered volume growth. July and August was slow to start, but September ended on a stronger note. Organic revenue growth continued to be at the high end of our long-term growth model and ongoing efficiency and effectiveness initiatives drove comparable operating margin expansion.\nThis led to a 6% comparable earnings per share growth despite 6% currency headwinds. We benefit from operating in a vibrant and resilient industry with ample headroom for growth. For the 18th consecutive quarter, we gained overall value share. We also held or gained value share across each of our geographic segments. By offering consumers choice across our total beverage portfolio by leveraging our systems capabilities.\nWe continue to build momentum to develop our industry and expand our lead over the long term. To deliver in today's environment, we're capitalizing on the strength of our portfolio and focusing on improving execution across all aspects of our strategic growth lie wheel. We have unparalleled portfolio power as demonstrated by our $30 billion brand, which we estimate represents approximately 1/4 of the $1 billion brands in the industry is approximately double our nearest competitor.\nAs we continue to develop love brands, we expect our number of $1 billion brands to grow. Our marketing transformation is centered on connecting deeply with consumers through digital engagement, personalized experiences, and cultural relevance. For example, we recently partnered with Universal Pictures and Bloom House on a Halloween campaign for Fanta that was activated in approximately 50 markets.\nBuilding on last year's success, the campaign featured iconic power characters on our packaging, limited-time flavors and immersive retail and digital experiences. While we're building capabilities in marketing, we're also prioritizing bigger and bolder innovation like Sprite plus tea in North America, Bacardi mix with Coca-Cola in Mexico and Europe and Powerade spring box addition in South Africa.\nDuring the first 3 quarters of this year, innovation contributed strongly to revenue growth, and we're continuing to have strong velocities on our innovation. Last, our marketing and innovation agenda is brought to life by execution in the market. Over the past decade, we've been on a journey to re-franchise company-owned bottlers to fortify our system and unlock further growth.\nRecently, we reached 2 significant steps in completing this journey. In July, we sold a 40% ownership stake in our company-owned Indian bottler to the [ Jubilant Bhartia Group. ] Additionally, this morning, Coca-Cola Hellenic announced its intention to acquire a controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which is expected to close next year, subject to regulatory approvals.\nWe believe these moves will unlock growth opportunities in India and Africa. [ Jubilant Bhartia ] has built and grown consumer businesses in India and Coca-Cola Hellenic has demonstrated a strong track record in Nigeria Egypt. Our global franchise model is a strategic differentiator and is very difficult to replicate. With these milestones, we have a clear line of sight to complete our re-franchising strategy allowing us to further focus on brand building and innovation complemented by integrated execution with our bottling partners.\nIn summary, we're confident we can navigate what comes at us, deliver on our 2025 guidance and create long-term value for our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to hand off the call to Henrique. In his nearly 30 years of the company, Henrique has worked on multiple continents and has been a strong partner to me and to our system in driving sustainable growth\n\nHenrique Braun\n\nPresident of International Development & Corporate Senior VP\n\nThank you, James. I'm glad to be joining the call today. I would like to begin by discussing how we responded to varying market dynamics during the quarter by adapting faster and then I will spend some time covering actions that we are taking to ensure we get better and sharper every day.\nStarting with North America. We delivered strong results despite ongoing differences in spending between income groups and slower traffic across channels, volume was flat and improved sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. We also gained value share and had strong revenue and profit growth.\nWe're investing behind our brands which led to broad-based strength across our total beverage portfolio. In addition to ongoing strength with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke had strong volume growth by reaching a new generation of consumers, with campaigns like no design, which invites drinkers to take a diet coke break.\nWe also launched innovations for our loyal consumer base like retro Diet Coke with cherry and this October, we are bringing back retro diet Coke with lime nationwide in the U.S. Across our portfolio, our system accelerated codeine equipment placement expanded availability for key packages and one share of visible inventory.\nIn Latin America, volume was flat but we gained value share in group organic revenue and comparable currency-neutral operating income. We are taking steps to address softening macroeconomic conditions in key markets like Mexico, we are seeing good reactions to some of our integrations, but we believe it will take time. We had continued growth in Brazil, where we gained value share with strong performance from Coca-Cola Zero Sugar driven by increasing trial with Duo pax for the linking the brand to the mills occasion and expanded refillable packaging option.\nAlso, in Mexico, [ Santa Colada ] recently became the value share leader within value-added dairy. In EMEA, we continued to grow volume and delivered strong revenue and profit growth. In Europe, volume declined driven by [indiscernible] tougher comparison versus previous year and mixed performance across Western and Eastern markets.\nWe partnered with the English Premier League with Coca-Cola, smart water and Powerade to tap into consumer passion for football. We featured this partnership on our packaging and offered exclusive fans activation and access to tickets, which helped recruit weekly plus drinkers.\nIn Eurasia and the Middle East and in Africa, we grew volume in both operating units despite volatile macroeconomic backdrops. We further emphasized our mix of local and global brands launched the impactful marketing campaigns like our partnership with [ Springbok Rugby ] in South Africa and innovations like [ Cape bubble ] in Turkey. Also, we sharpened our revenue growth management capability and highlighted the localness of our system.\nLastly, in Asia Pacific, volume declined across each of the operating units driven by softer consumer spending, weaker industry performance and inclement weather in a few markets like India and the Philippines. However, we gained by the share and grew revenue and profit for the segment. We are focusing on granular channel execution plans, tailoring our brand price architecture with a focus on affordability and investing for growth.\nPutting it all together, we continue to execute in an uncertain external environment with strong plans in place and a focus on driving profitable growth. While our strategy continues to deliver, the world around us is changing. And as we have done throughout our history, we will continue to evolve to capture the full potential of our system.\nTogether with our bottling partners, we are leveraging capabilities to deepen consumer connections, build on brand and execute of excellence. Digital platforms are helping us to connect the dots across our system enabling better experiences for our consumers and customers. As we adapt, we will enhance the way we work to move faster and with greater precision.\nWe will become even more consumer-centric to drive enduring growth for our system and industry. Overall, I'm encouraged by the energy across the network. We are learning fast, pushing boundaries and unlocking new opportunities to deliver for the long term.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, Henrique, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2025 and provide some early commentary on 2026. During the third quarter, we grew organic revenues 6%. Unit cases grew 1% after a slower start, we ended with improved performance. During the quarter, 2-year volume trends accelerated each month.\nConcentrate sales were 1 point behind unit care sales driven primarily by the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 6% was primarily driven by approximately 4 points of pricing actions and 2 points of favorable mix. Pricing from intense inflationary markets has largely abated. Comparable gross margin declined approximately 10 basis points while comparable operating margin increased approximately 120 basis points.\nOur year-to-date comparable operating margin expansion has been driven by our continued productivity mindset. While we're continuing to invest for growth, we're also driving productivity, including prioritizing supply chain efficiencies and improving the efficiency of our advertising spend and being prudent with our expense base.\nPutting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.82 in increased 6% year-over-year despite 6% currency headwinds, higher net interest expense and an increase in our effective tax rate. Free cash flow, excluding the [ Fairlife ] contingent consideration payment was $8.5 billion, which was an increase versus the prior year. Growth was driven by underlying business performance and lower tax payments, partially offset by cycling working capital benefits in the prior year. Our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8x EBITDA, which is below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x.\nWe're confident in our long-term free cash flow generation and have ample balance sheet capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda, which prioritizes reinvesting in our business and returning capital to our share owners. I also want to give a quick update regarding our ongoing dispute with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nA portion of our case relates to royalties from our Brazilian affiliates that were blocked under Brazilian law. The recent 3M appellate court decision addressed the same underlying regulation. We believe this case is highly supportive of our position. As we have said many times in the past, we're continuing to vigorously defend our overall position and are encouraged about our chances of prevailing on appeal.\nAs previously mentioned, we're confident we will deliver on our 2025 guidance. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of approximately 8%, both of which reflect delivery in line with our long-term growth algorithm. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we continue to expect a 1- to 2-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 5-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2025.\nOur underlying effective tax rate for 2025 is now expected to be 20.7%. All in, based on what we know today, we continue to expect 2025 comparable earnings per share growth of approximately 3% versus $2.88 in 2024. Last, excluding the [ Fairlife ] contingent consideration payment, we now expect to generate at least $9.8 billion of free cash flow in 2025.\nThere are a couple of considerations to keep in mind for the fourth quarter of 2025. We're cycling a more difficult volume comparison in some of our key markets. And due to our reporting calendar there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. While it is too early to provide specific guidance for 2026, we want to share some considerations based on what we know today.\nFirst, a calendar shift will impact the quarterly cadence as we will have 6 additional days in the first quarter and 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter. We're focused on driving balanced top line growth with volume as a key priority. As inflation moderates, we anticipate pricing to normalize and we lean into both affordability and premiumization, depending on what the market demands.\nWith respect to commodities, while we're experiencing cost inflation we believe the overall impact is manageable. However, the company and our system source several items exposed to volatility and trade dynamics, which could cause our outlook to vary across our markets.\nWe continue to challenge all aspects of how we work, and we see opportunities to unlock cost efficiencies that can be reinvested to support portfolio growth and long-term value creation. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be a slight tailwind to both comparable net revenues and comparable earnings per share for full year 2026.\nMany factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business outlook between now and when we expect to provide guidance in February. In summary, while our external environment is dynamic, we see great potential for our industry and remain steadfastly focused on driving growth.\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 guidance and create enduring value for our stakeholders. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

    "content": "Q2 2025 The Coca-Cola Co Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2025 The Coca-Cola Co Earnings Call\n\nKONYSEJUL 22, 8:30 AM\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nFirst half of this year, we're on track to deliver on both our top line and updated bottom line guidance. We're confident we can navigate varying local market dynamics during the remainder of 2025 to deliver on our updated guidance. This morning, I'll provide details on the operating environment and our second quarter business performance. Then I'll explain how we're pivoting our plans and building new capabilities to deliver amidst the current realities.\nJohn will end by discussing our financial results and providing further commentary on the outlook for the rest of the year. Coming into the quarter, we expected the operating landscape to be choppy. Volume declined 1% during the quarter as we cycled a difficult comparison versus the prior year.\nTwo-year volume trends were on track in April and May, but decelerated in June in the face of adverse weather in several key markets and pockets of consumer pressure. Several markets that were weaker in the Q1 improved volume sequentially, including the US and Europe. In these markets, the plans we've implemented are working, providing further confidence we can influence the trajectory of our results.\nWe also delivered 5% organic revenue growth and robust margin expansion, which led to 4% comparable earnings per share growth despite currency headwinds and a higher effective tax rate. More broadly, our industry remains resilient. During the quarter, we gained Value Share, which represented our 17th consecutive quarter of value share gains across the world. We're navigating complex dynamics across many markets by leveraging our global scale while stepping up local execution starting in North America.\nWhile volume improved sequentially, it declined due to the continued uncertainty and pressure on some socio-economic segments of consumers. We continued to invest behind our brands which led to value share gains and revenue and profit growth. Our price mix decelerated as growth from some of our premium stills brands moderated during the quarter.\nOur Granular Action plans to win back consumers with contextually relevant advertising, more focused value and affordability initiatives, and close customer partnerships are working. Several bright spots in our total beverage portfolio include Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke, Fanta, Fairlife, BODYARMOR, and Powerade, which each grew volume. We're continuing to get good traction with our foodservice customers on both renewals and category expansion, and our system is stepping up execution and earning increased share of visible inventory.\nIn Latin America, volume declined, but we grew organic revenue and profit. We benefited from the improving economy in Argentina, and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar had strong volume growth in Brazil and Mexico. In Mexico, despite cycling a difficult comparison versus the prior year and navigating a more difficult start to the year, two-year volume trends improved during the quarter until uncharacteristically cold weather and a major hurricane impacted the trajectory in June.\nTo drive transactions, we're reprioritizing investments driving affordability with refillables and premiumization with single-serve offerings and scaling connected packaging, and our system's digital customer platforms. In EMEA, all three of our operating units grew volume, and we also had revenue and profit growth. In Europe, volume growth was driven by both emerging Eastern and Western markets and was partially helped by cycling an easier comparison versus the prior year.\nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, and Fuze Tea each grew volume. We activated our Share A Coke campaign across 38 markets in Europe and included prominent musicians and influencers. The campaign leveraged a Memory Maker digital tool which allowed drinkers in some markets to share personalized memes and videos with friends and family. We also tapped into Sprite, Spicy Meals and one of our campaigns in Eurasia and Middle East. Despite multiple conflicts in the region during the quarter, we grew volume and won value share.\nWe're leveraging our learnings to emphasize the localness of our system which includes local sourcing, production, employment, and distribution. We're focusing on locally relevant sparkling flavors, innovations, and affordability with attractive absolute price points, value packages, and tailored promotions. In Africa, despite a worsening macroeconomic growth outlook, we grew volume. Egypt, Morocco, and Nigeria each continued their strong momentum.\nOur systems actions are working. We've refined our packed price architecture, executed fewer but bolder integrated marketing campaigns, and accelerated cold drink equipment placement. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, after a strong Q1, we had mixed performance across the region, volume declined, but we grew both revenue and comparable currency-neutral operating income.\nIn ASEAN and South Pacific, volume declined as growth in Australia and the Philippines was more than offset by declines in Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. However, we won value share and our system is taking action by scaling refillable offerings, increasing outlet coverage, and accelerating cooler placement.\nIn China, we grew volume despite a cautious consumer environment thanks to stronger performance from trademark Coca-Cola and in the eating and drinking channel. Our system is developing more granular channel and customer-specific execution strategies, driving more tailored promotional campaigns, and accelerating cooler placement. In India, after a strong start to the year, volume declined as our business was impacted by early monsoons and geopolitical conflict early in the important summer season.\nIn response, we're engaging consumers with integrated marketing campaigns like Coca-Cola and meals supported by execution in the QSR channel, Thums Up with Biryani, Sprite with spicy meals, and Maaza with festivals and tailoring these activations to regional and local needs. Also, our system is adding customer outlets and recently surpassed 1 million customers on its digital ordering platforms in Japan and South Korea. Industry volume declined amid a challenging macro environment.\nOur volume was also down, reflecting industry dynamics and a strong prior-year comparison. Nevertheless, two-year volume trends remained positive during the quarter. In response to the external environment, our system is refining channel and investment strategies to capture emerging growth opportunities. To sum everything up, while the external environment continues to evolve, we remain steadfastly focused on maintaining agility, and we're taking the appropriate actions to deliver on our updated 2025 guidance.\nCritically, to deliver amidst the current realities, we're enhancing capabilities along each facet of our strategic growth flywheel by investing to drive transactions in the back half of the year. Our marketing transformation allows us to more quickly test ideas, share learnings, and scale successful campaigns. For example, to mitigate consumer pressure in Mexico stemming from geopolitical tensions, our teams implemented tactics similar to those developed last year in Turkey, tailored to local needs.\nDuring the quarter, we launched the Juntos Por Cien Años campaign, which highlights our long-standing contribution to the Mexican economy. At the same time, we leaned further into consumer passion points and pull forward our World Cup activation by giving away 1,000 tickets to next year's event. As a result of these initiatives, combined with strong local execution, monthly value share trends, and consumer perception scores improved significantly in Mexico during the quarter.\nWhile we're lifting and shifting learnings across markets, we're also revamping and creating new campaigns and leveraging passion points. In April, we launched the return of the iconic Share A Coke campaign across more than 120 countries with over 30,000 names on approximately 10 billion bottles and cans tailored to local markets.\nAlso in North America, we launched the Bring the Juice campaign during the quarter, which featured a collaboration between Minute Maid and World Wrestling Entertainment that includes digital experiences, limited-time-only packaging, and in-store activations. Our innovation agenda supports our overall growth strategy by focusing on understanding and anticipating consumer needs to make a greater impact and improve return on investment; we're leveraging our portfolio of $30 billion brands.\nFor example, during the quarter we launched Sprite Tea in North America, which contributed to increased share of visible inventory. This limited-time-only innovation blends the refreshment of Sprite with the flavor of tea and adds to the recent hits under the Sprite trademark including Sprite Chill, Sprite Winter Spice Cranberry, and Sprite Lemonade. Sprite Tea started as an experimental project. We scaled the launch after seeing strong consumer demand and positive social media reaction.\nAs a result of on-brand innovation, Sprite became the number three sparkling soft drink brand in the US, as Beverage Digest announced in April. We're always exploring ways to meet evolving consumer preferences for great tasting refreshment, including with our iconic Coca-Cola brand. As you may have seen last week, we appreciate the President's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand, and as part of our ongoing innovation agenda this fall in the United States, we plan to expand our trademark Coca-Cola product range with US Cane Sugar to reflect consumer interest in differentiated experiences.\nThis addition is designed to complement our strong core portfolio and offer more choice across occasions and preferences. Revenue growth management is a critical tool to segment our consumers and channels, and we're increasingly integrating the capability with our marketing expertise to drive transaction growth.\nTo step up our capabilities, we are leveraging learnings across our markets and marrying digital investments with clear, compelling points of sale messaging in stores and on packs. While it takes patience and discipline to build a Refillables franchise, we're tapping into learnings from our strong capabilities in Latin America to grow Refillables over the long term in Africa, the Philippines, Thailand, and parts of Eurasia and the Middle East.\nOn the premiumization side, we're leveraging our experience in North America to grow Mini Cans in Europe. And finally, last year we piloted an AI-based pack-price channel optimization tool in Mexico. Results so far have shown this tool improves our offerings and speed to market. So far we scaled this platform to eight markets across four operating units.\nLastly, robust local execution is key to ensuring the success of our top-line initiatives. Our system is stronger than ever, which ultimately leads to commitments to further invest to drive growth. We've collectively ushered in a culture of learning from one another, and we aspire to improve every aspect of how we do business.\nTo summarize, while the external environment continues to be dynamic and there is no doubt that much uncertainty remains in the downhill, we remain growth oriented, we're continuing to pivot our plans as needed, and we are harnessing our All-Weather Strategy to deliver on our growth ambitions. Before I conclude, I'd like to recognize the efforts and unwavering dedication of our system employees around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the first half of 2025 we delivered positive volume organic revenue growth at the high end of our long-term algorithm, robust margin expansion, and continued earnings per share growth in a very dynamic operating landscape. During Q2 we invested with discipline to achieve our objectives. We grew organic revenues 5%. Unit cases declined 1%, largely due to a weaker-than-expected June. Concentrate sales were even with unit cases.\nOur price/mix growth of 6% was primarily driven by approximately 5 points of pricing actions and 1 point of favorable mix. Pricing from intense inflationary markets contributed to approximately 1 point of price/mix growth, down from approximately 5 points in full year 2024. Comparable gross margin increased approximately 80 basis points, and comparable operating margin increased approximately 190 basis points.\nBoth were driven by underlying expansion partially offset by currency headwinds. Approximately one-third of our underlying expansion was driven by faster realization of our productivity initiatives, while the rest was driven by timing of investments and favorable cycling versus the prior year. Putting it all together, Q2 comparable EPS of $0.87 increased 4% year over year despite 5% currency headwinds, elevated net interest expense, and an approximate 2-point increase in our effective tax rate.\nFree cash flow excluding the fairlife contingent consideration payment was $3.9 billion, which is an increase of approximately $600 million versus the prior year. Growth was driven by underlying business performance and lower tax payments partially offset by cycling working capital benefits in the prior year. During the quarter we made our final $1.2 billion transition tax payment related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 2x EBITDA, which is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. We're confident in our long-term free cash flow generation and have ample balance sheet capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda, which prioritizes continuing to invest in our business and returning capital to our shareowners enabled by our All-Weather Strategy.\nWe're updating our 2025 guidance, which takes into consideration our actions to drive growth in a dynamic context, and what we know today about our external environment. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, but now expect comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of approximately 8%, both of which reflect delivery in line with our long-term growth algorithm.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate 1 to 2 point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year to 2025. While we recognize there's recently been some favorable currency movements, we hedge much of our developed market and some of our developing market exposure and will take time to see the full benefits.\nWe will continue to utilize the disciplined hedging strategy that provides greater certainty for decision making. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2025 is still expected to be 20.8%, which is more than a 2 point increase versus the prior year. All in, based on what we know today, we now expect 2025 comparable earnings per share growth of approximately 3% versus $2.88 in 2024.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind for the remainder of 2025. We continue to expect our external landscape to be dynamic, and we expect recovery in some markets to take time. We are expecting concentrate sales to run slightly behind unit cases during Q3. Based on what we know today, we continue to believe the impact of global trade dynamics on our cost structure will be manageable.\nGiven the strong margin expansion that came through earlier in the year, we no longer expect margins to be back half-weighted in 2025. Last, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in Q4. So, in summary, while the external environment continues to evolve, we're successfully pivoting to continue to deliver top-line growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share growth.\nIn the first half of the year, we've effectively tackled many challenges not anticipated at the outset, and we will continue to adapt to whatever lies ahead. Thanks to the proven strength of our system, we have great confidence we will deliver on our updated 2025 guidance and create enduring value for our stakeholders. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press star1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star1 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. I was struck by the use of the phrase, the word pivot, you know, pivoting our plans, adjusting our plans a couple times in both of your prepared remarks, and yet you had, you know, very solid, good, strong organic sales growth this quarter. Profitability was really striking, and the outlook for the second half through feels comparably strong, frankly, with just a little bit less margin expansion.\nSo maybe I can just really focus on that pivot plans piece to understand maybe more concisely, what it is? You know, as you're thinking about the back half of the year, does the environment feel that it's tougher? Does it mean that, you know, the sort of puts and takes of which markets you thought would go one way versus another is the key to what that pivot commentary means. But I could use a little clarification on all of that. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. I think, thank you for noticing that we had a strong first half, and guidance implies a strong second half, and we certainly are aiming to deliver that. I think how you should interpret the pivot comment is really in the context of us pursuing growth under the All-Weather Strategy. This year has been, I think, characterized by rapid turns of events and twists and turns, which has required us to respond with greater agility and speed. So if you just want to compare and contrast Q1 to Q2, in Q1 the US and Europe were slightly weaker, but we pivoted or we adapted with some agility, and we got much better coming into Q2 in those developed markets.\nAnd yet in Q2 in a couple of our big emerging markets, Mexico and India, for example, partly they had strong comparisons to prior year, but we got hit by some early monsoon in India which is the important selling season, plus the India-Pakistan conflict brief as it was, plus weather in Mexico which required us to pivot to bring back growth in those parts of the world coming into the second half. So it's really, if you like, about the need for the All-Weather Strategy to be taken up another notch in terms of how fast you can pivot and execute to still deliver the results that we're delivering.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. So protein's a space that's on trend with the consumer. It's growing at very strong rates. You obviously have a clear competitive advantage with the fairlife brand, but given all those factors, you are running into capacity constraints. So just with that as a backdrop, I was hoping you could give us a sense of how much of an unlock the planned US capacity additions are starting in early 2026 for Fairlife, both the total volume, but also how that will enable you to manage each of the three fairlife product areas differently.\nAnd then also can you discuss if there's any international Fairlife plans on the horizon outside of North America over the next few years? I know replicating the North America dairy manufacturing footprint will be difficult. So just how realistic is international expansion at some point and in what time frame? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. Firstly, Fairlife continues to have strong growth, double-digit volume growth in the second quarter. Clearly that's moderating slightly from Q1 and prior year, but we still expect to get. Volume growth in the second half. Again, although moderating as we wait for the capacity to come online. I think the team has done a great job of creating some space this year to keep growing.\nAs you point out, the New York facility will come online at the beginning of 2026. Obviously, that doesn't all turn on with a flick of the switch on day one, as much as one would wish it would be so, and that will ramp up over 2026, but it will steadily debottleneck our constraints on capacity across all the different Fairlife variants and package sizes.\nSo, we have that coming online in 2026. We also have, over the time frame going into the future, options to expand capacity some of the existing facilities. So I think the narrowing of the corridor is really the second half, maybe the first few months of next year, but we're basically going to get through that and doing really well with Fairlife so far.\nSecondly, as it relates to international having made some. Investments in dairy, which were unhappy in small countries and with small investments, it is worth pointing out that Santa Clara in Mexico also had a strong performance, is now the number one value-added dairy business in Mexico. So not under the fairlife brand, but actually a big market with a good position in value-added dairy there.\nWe continue to look at other international opportunities as you rightly point out, the structure of the dairy industry in the US is different relative to other parts of the world, but protein is very on trend. We know that Fairlife and Core Power are strongly differentiated and preferred as products and brands, and we are of course looking to see if we can deliver those sorts of consumer benefits in other parts of the world in ways that we feel would give us a competitive advantage versus whatever's in the marketplace at the time. More to come.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nResearch Analyst of United States, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much and good morning everybody. James, just going back to Mexico and India. Just given some of the pivots. That you've made in those markets going into the back half, I guess. The question is how quickly do you expect. A rebound in those markets and if. Are there any other markets as you go into the back half that you would flag as kind of known kind of watch points going into Q3?\nI'd also like to, just because of the strong profit improvement or profit performance in the first half and in the quarter we just saw, it doesn't seem to imply maybe a little bit more reinvestment in the back half. If that's the case, just any. Color on where that incremental investment may be targeted would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. Firstly, while being known to be calm, I'm not wildly known to be patient. So the sooner the volume bounces back, the better. I think in the case of Mexico, clearly Q2 last year was the strongest quarter. It's worth being upfront and saying Q3 was the weaker quarter. So I think we're going into a cycling that should help us.\nWe've got some strong plans to take Mexico, for one example, on affordability, doubling down on refillables and some of the value offerings. We're also celebrating our 100th anniversary in Mexico with Juntos por Cien Años, which is really about emphasizing the long-standing economic impact, which is going back to some of the Hispanic issues that bled across the border in the first half.\nAnd we're pulling together some of the marketing activation and execution activation with our bottling partners. So we're confident not just in the long-term, but also in our ability to get back to growth as we come into Q2 and get out of some of the colder weather and the hurricane that was through in June.\nIn the case of India. India, as we've talked, or both John and I have said in previous calls, is never going to be a straight line, and indeed Q2 was not. But we're very bullish on India overall. The Q2 did decline, as I said, the conflict in the monsoon. But we have a lot of marketing campaigns focused on India.\nWe have also just set up the first kind of refranchising piece with the Jubilant Group for the company-owned bottler that we have in which, which is basically the bottom half of India, and that's up and running with a new CEO. So we think that will bring some new energy, dynamism, focus, and proactivity to the execution in the marketplace. So we think we've got a strong plan from a marketing and innovation point of view. The local franchise bottlers were doing better than the CBO in the first half.\nWith some re-energized focus on this transition bottler, we're pretty confident on where we'll go in India. Then, as it relates to your second question, profit improvement, yes, it does imply a little bit of reinvestment. There's a piece of timing in there. We had expected more of the productivity in the second half, and we got some of it in the first half, but which of course moves the money around.\nSo that's the piece of it. But we also are, as we've said in previous years, we continue to lean into growth, we've got a growth strategy, we're delivering growth, and we're going to continue to invest into that to drive momentum and assure momentum in the second half, but also set ourselves up for a good 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGood morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the North American market. We've seen a little bit of an improvement in the volume in the unit case. Volume still negative, but just any thoughts? On the outlook as you move forward? In the back half, especially on two. Points, the QSR and away from home, China more broadly, how you seeing the trends evolving there, and then also the trend among the Hispanic consumer, which was the pressure in Q1 and it seems to have gotten better throughout Q2. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. First, the overall, the US did business. Did a very strong job in coming back from a slower start in Q1 and getting sequentially better in Q2, getting some good revenue growth. Share was good and profit was good. So really getting better. And I think that's in the context of a pretty resilient overall consumer. The aggregate spend is holding up. Yes, there's some pressure in those with lower incomes where we're targeting some affordability.\nSome special focus on marketing and occasions. I think the overall outlook continues to be resilient, and we're investing for growth in that. Just on the Hispanic consumer. Yes, we had a problem in the first half if you take the end of June. By the end of June we had basically got back to the share we started the year with. We got back to the brand equity scores, we were looking back and we got back to the household penetrations.\nBut obviously as that went down into the valley from January to March, it had to climb out of the valley from April to June. So it was still a headwind in the second quarter. But the issue is now largely resolved. We're back to where we were, and there was a lot of good stuff on some very targeted contextual advertising against the false video and a lot of focus on how local the Coke business is.\nIt's, you know, it's made in the US. It's made by US employees, it's distributed by US employees and US retailers. So I think we've kind of put that one behind us for now. And then the Away From Home channel, obviously depending on where you are on the Away From Home channel, you get slightly better or slightly worse footfall and traffic.\nBut I think this is really not a different reflection of the overall economy where you see some of the bits of the channels where you've got the lower income consumers a little more focused on affordability offers. So you definitely see that coming up. But the team has done a good job on customer renewals and bringing in new accounts like Costco and Carnival. So we're seeing some pretty good reaction there, but I don't think one should think about it as that different a representation than the overall market.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning, James. I wanted to drill down something. You mentioned that productivity came in better than expected in the first half. So just, you know, hoping you could just provide a little bit more color on sort of what drove that upside and then how we should think about that in the back half in some of your, you know, the rest of your productivity initiatives planned for this year. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. Two basic sources of the productivity. One was the benefit of the Marketing Transformation. We've been on a journey for the last few years on the Marketing Transformation, which is not just about the effectiveness, the digitization of the advertising, and the segmenting of the advertising, but also about the efficiency both of producing it and of buying the media where we use the advertising.\nWe were able to capture some of those savings. Just from a timing perspective, there was just a little more of them in the first half and the second half, but those were always on the way. It's a product of the work we've been doing over the last couple of years to really reform how we do the marketing to be not just more effective, but to also bring some efficiency to bear.\nAnd then the other piece of the productivity was setting out to be as disciplined as possible on the operating expenses, and to be a little more frugal and to invest our money a little wiser as we went in. And we were able to just capture some of those benefits as we came into Q2. Ahead of the second half. So mainly just getting things done a little quicker than anticipated, which is good news.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, everyone. This will be slightly connected, but a bit more specific. North America margins were incredibly strong in Q2, even with higher marketing on a year-on-year basis. I understand there are so many puts and takes, but I would love to get your take on how these margins have been evolving. Some of the key drivers between perhaps pricing or cost savings, product mix, channel mix. Again, I fully appreciate there are so many drivers every quarter, but the evolution here has been sequentially and directionally positive, and moving in the right direction. So I'd love to get your broader thoughts on what you think is driving this and the durability. Thanks so much.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. Firstly, I mean, I'll give you some factors relative to Q2, but as I've done normally, the question comes on Asia Pacific on margins being strange movements intra-quarter. I would encourage you to take a multi-quarter view of any bits of the business rather than one. Having said that, clearly the margins got better in Q2 in North America. Clearly part of that was coming from the productivity initiatives as I just described them.\nSome of it comes a little bit from with the deceleration of some of the vertically integrated businesses. They're mixing in less operating expense. So that kind of makes a difference. The vertically integrated business is tending to have a slightly lower percent margin than the concentrate businesses. So that's another driver of what's going on.\nI think what's also important to understand is none of this is happening in the absence of continuing to invest behind our brands. We were still very strongly investing, not just in innovation, but actually in absolute marketing terms in the US market to continue to drive growth. So it's not while the margin has been improving in the US marketplace over time, and if you go back four years, it was not in a great place. So I think it's kind of more normalized, and what it's a feature of is that normalization and productivity. But the most important story is continuing to invest heavily behind our portfolio, our innovation, our execution to drive growth and gain share.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey guys, good morning. I guess three questions in a row. On margins, but this will be a bit different. Obviously productivity coming in a little bit better. The margins look at the same time. The. Impact from foreign currency seems to. Be abating, and if it continues in. This way, might even move in a. Positive direction as we get into next year. Can you maybe just talk about the operating leverage across the P&L? Given how much has changed so far and these really two factors sort of very much moving in your favor. Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola\n\nLet me take that one, James. So yes, you've got two distinctive factors, I think James covered well. The drivers of operating leverage on both the gross and operating margin lines, which we continue to expect to deliver in the second half of the year, albeit at a slightly lower rate than we had previously flagged.\nAnd then on the currency front. As you all know, we hedge as a risk management tool to help us smooth fluctuations and provide greater certainty at the local market level. In the year to date, the main influence of the year to date has been the performance of the G10 currencies which we hedge on a consistent basis. Those hedges are somewhat offsetting the actual dollar weakness that we have seen against those currencies emerging on the emerging markets front, not as much.\nSo as we look to the second half of the year, and we'll provide more color in October on our outlook for 2026, you know, the updated guidance reflects a softening of the negative impact that we had been experiencing on the overall currency front. So net slightly better environment. We continue to hedge to, as i said to smooth the fluctuations that we typically experience. We'll provide an update for 2026 on the October call.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of the Global Beverages and Household Products Team, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. James, can you talk a little bit about, globally, what you're seeing in terms of consumer strength? The sense I got, and maybe I misheard, but the sense I got was that you were a little bit surprised by some pockets of consumer weakness globally, apart from the weather, apart from geopolitical issues. So is that right? What are you seeing from the consumer globally? And if things did weaken a bit in June, how has that progressed into July? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nYeah, thanks, Robert. Yeah. I mean, let me just stand back again on the volume around the world. Q2, we had good performances and improving sequentially. So North America improved sequentially. Europe was up, Middle East was up, Africa was up, China was up. And apart from the two that I mentioned in terms of the weaker performance, India and Mexico, there was a little bit of weakness in Japan, but there was also some, I think the one that kind of was the most.\nI don't know if I go as far as surprising, but, let's go with surprising just for the sake of the argument was more Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the ASEAN markets. We saw some weakness in Q2, which was perhaps a little more than we've been expecting. So I would say overall that the global economy and the global consumer remains resilient. There have been some swings in countries a bit like I said at the beginning and answer one of the questions, things have come in and out at greater speed than perhaps historically.\nAnd so something can get worse and then better again at a faster velocity than perhaps in the past. And there are obviously been some geopolitical events that happened in Q2 and they've come in and out quickly to some of them. So the rate of surprise is kind of speeded up. But I think you've got to stand back, actually, overall, there was a pretty resilient consumer environment, pluses and minuses by the countries.\nIf I had to say one that was a little surprising, it would be ASEAN, leaving aside weather and things like that. We're confident we're investing in the right programs for the second half. Marketing, innovation, and RGM execution to make sure that as we drive our top line algorithm for the second half, that will come with a better volume component.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. I wanted to ask on the potential innovation into pure sugarcane. And then, if you can talk about it like in the context of consumer preference. And appetite to expand into more fiber, you see, like a competitor launching a prebiotic under their main trademark and how it's simply performing. Our thoughts on participating more in that segment. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nYeah, thanks. Look, we're always. I don't think just us, but I think the industry, given its size, its attractiveness, and its growth potential, we're always looking for opportunities to innovate and see whether there's an intersection of new ideas and where consumer preferences are evolving towards, remembering that actually most innovations don't work in the long run.\nBut I think, you know, it's a good sign that the industry, including ourselves, are trying lots of different things as it relates to the cane sugar. Yes, we're going to be bringing a Coke sweetened with US cane sugar into the market this fall, and I think that will be an enduring option for consumers. Actually, we use cane sugar in a number of our other brands in the US portfolio, from lemonades to teas.\nSome of the coffee stuff, some of the vitaminwater drinks so that it's blended into some of our other products. And so we are definitely looking to use the whole toolbox, the whole toolkit of available sweetening options to some extent where there are consumer preferences. So we will continue to do that. And as we experiment, yes, with fiber, I think you're referring to the Coke with fiber in Japan. And so that's been an interesting option and we collected some valuable learnings for it.\nSo we just continue to focus on trying things, understanding it takes a long time to build a new franchise with consumers, but you got to try things. And we know our success rates substantially above the industry. But it's still a question of it takes time and commitment to build something new.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. James, I wanted to ask a follow-up question on Fairlife, and just in your response to Dara's question, you talked about that growth has kind of moderated sequentially and you expect it to moderate further in the back half of the year.\nI'm assuming that that's simply related to the capacity constraints you mentioned and that your outlook or expectations for category growth or the competitive environment haven't shifted. So maybe just confirming that and then just on that last point, I think it'll be helpful to get some perspective. On the competitive environment and how you see that evolving in the back half of the year and into 2026. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nYes, I can confirm the moderation we're expecting is the law of big numbers and the capacity constraint rather than a weakening of the proposition relative to the competition. We're still very excited about the opportunity for Fairlife, Core Power, and the Fairlife Nutrition Plan. I have no doubt in my mind that if we had more capacity, we could sell more product today, tomorrow, and going into the rest of the year.\nSo it really is a capacity narrowing of the bottleneck that we're experiencing. Of course, this gets bigger and bigger and bigger, that the percentages will come down even if the absolutes continue to be big in growth terms. And yes, it's not surprising that when our competitors and other people see the standout growth and success of a product like Fairlife or Core Power, they will naturally seek to see if they can launch. And that's the nature of the industry. And it keeps us all on our toes to know competition is always trying to catch us up.\nAnd so we'll be very focused on doing the best of Fairlife, not just on the marketing, but on the execution. And of course, increasingly, as we have new capacity with new innovations and new thinking on where we can take the fairlife brand and the Core Power brand. But exciting times ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nDirector and Head of US Consumer Staples Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It seems like we've gone the whole call without actually talking about Europe, so. Wanted to ask there. James, it seems like as we get into the back half, EMEA is probably going to be driving the bus a bit from a unit case perspective. So just wanted to get your perspectives on how the consumer there is going to be held up better relative to other developed markets, and how you see the second half playing out across EMEA. Thanks very much.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nYeah, so you interchanged Europe and EMEA, so I'll kind of break that down. Europe certainly did better in Q2. It had positive volume growth, and it had price/mix, a pretty balanced growth across the different aspects, and both East and West contributing to the growth. And so I think it's still worth saying that Europe is a bit like the US in the sense that there's a pretty resilient consumer overall in aggregate.\nBut at the lower end of the income spectrum, we do see a lot of value seeking and affordability behavior. So we're having to double down on that. And within that, we had a great quarter in terms of Coke Zero Sugar and Sprite and Fuze Tea. And I think there were some really good programs on Fanta as well. So Europe overall, a great start as it relates to other bits of EMEA.\nOverall, we gained value in EMEA. Africa grew volumes despite cycling some pretty tough comps. Obviously, the macros can be pretty dynamic in Africa, but good strong performance across Africa. Then in Eurasia we've been leaning into the localness of the business.\nAnd that part of the world was also able to grow volume. So actually a good performance across the three main components of the EMEA group. And I think in Africa, EMEA, it was driven by Coke, Flavors, and some great execution by the system.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery, from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just wanted to switch maybe a little bit longer-term question on coffee. You've obviously got brands like Georgia and Costa that are strong in certain markets, but globally it's a big attractive category. I guess maybe just would love to hear some of what you're learning as you reflect on your strategy there, and what it might take to win, and how your participation in the category might evolve over time.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nYeah, thanks, Michael. Yeah, Costa, I think that counts as, if we're going to count Georgia as one of attempt, Costa would count as our fourth attempt in coffee because we've got Georgia and Costa. We tried with an investment in Keurig and there was something in the 60s called Duncan Coffee. So we totally recognize what you're pointing out, which is that coffee is a large, fragmented, growing category in the total beverage industry. So it's clearly attractive if we in the bottling system can find ways to participate more deeply in that category.\nNow, having said that, our investment in Costa is not where we wanted it to be from an investment hypothesis point of view. I mean, the business is still a good business, but it's not quite delivered on the different verticals of growth that we were hoping to accelerate much quicker. The ready to drink coffee, the express, and that the at home, and therefore the business remains more weighted towards stores, and the stores we've been driving the affordability and actually doing a good job on refreshing the stores and driving the speed of service. But still, the investment hypothesis as originally intended has not played out despite the improvement in the store business.\nSo, I think I would say we're in the mode of reflecting on what we've learned, thinking about how we might want to find new avenues to grow in the coffee category, while continuing to run the cost of business successfully, because it's still a lot of money we put down, and we want that money to work as hard as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director, HSBC\n\nYes, good morning. This question may be perhaps for John. John, for years we've heard you talk about wanting to refranchise for the purpose of focusing more on creating demand. With most of this refranchising done now, how is the focus and capability of creating demand, of recruiting new consumers intensifying?\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola\n\nThanks, Carlos. First, maybe just a comment on the refranchising. So we still got a couple of big chunks to go. And yet we are, as we've discussed in the past, we're very focused on getting those over the line as quickly as is feasible. Adjacent to that, and I think it's been a feature of the last few years, is this underlying emphasis on driving top line growth through a increasingly strong, stronger growth portfolio of brands.\nWe have 30 billion-dollar brands in our portfolio today, about half of them organic, the other half inorganic. There's a lot of runway left on those brands. And the marketing and innovation transformation that we have also discussed in prior meetings. There's still a tremendous amount to do there. So we expect to double down even more on both the existing portfolio that we have and then through the innovation lens to either continue to develop either organically or stay opportunistic on the inorganic front. That's part one.\nPart two is, I think, the relationship that we have with our bottling partners around the world. Has evolved significantly in the past few years with even greater clarity on what we expect from each other. As a result, stronger partnerships that leads to overall better execution with a scale business. The daily execution piece requires both of us to be at our best. A sort of a net outcome of the refranchising that you just asked about is that it allows us to do so, and it allows us to have the franchises in the hands of partners who are equally committed to raising the bar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thank you for the question, John. I just wanted to get a sense of your level of conviction that concentrate volume returns to positive territory in the back half of the year. You know there appear to have been some transitory elements negatively impacting Q2 and also a tough comp. And then secondly, just in terms of phasing, it would appear that Q4 has a tough comp in terms of concentrate volume. Am I looking at that correctly, and is there anything that you can add to that? Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola\n\nSure. So, we, you know, our guidance for the full year reflects a confidence that we will have positive volume growth in the second half of the year. I think out of two quarters, Q3 we're certainly cycling a more modest prior year. I think rather than be overly focused on the prior year, I think our ability to influence the next six months is what's most important.\nAnd if you look at Q2 and you take away a couple of the, I would call them anomalies. In some of the key markets there's still pretty good underlying momentum in the business. We have the opportunity on the back of a stronger than expected first half on the profit front to. Have more optionality on how we continue to invest. Some of our efficiencies which we plan to do, so we've got a robust second half on the investment front. Underlying trends for us in general are good, and a couple of the outliers that have been a headwind in recent months. We are comfortable that they can get back on track.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola\n\nThank you, Operator. So to summarize, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on our updated 2025 ambitions and guidance. We're continuing to build our systems to drive long-term growth, and we're confident we will continue to create enduring value for our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\n\nOperator",

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact The Coca-Cola Company’s media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Re-enter the queue to ask any follow-ups. Now I will turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the Q1 reflect the continued execution of our all-weather strategy and demonstrate the resilience of our business as we navigate a dynamic external environment. We delivered 2% volume growth and organic revenue growth at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. We also delivered comparable gross and operating margin expansion. With this as context, we're grounded in our starting point of human centricity. Our Q1 results would not have been possible without the actions of our people around the world. I'd like to express my gratitude to our system associates who are adapting quickly and creating enduring value. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to be consumer and customer-centric. Based on what we know today, we believe we can achieve our 2025 guidance.\nThis morning, I'll provide further detail on our Q1 business performance and will discuss the current operating environment. Then I'll explain how we're improving execution and investing to strengthen our system. John will also discuss our financial results and provide further commentary on the outlook for the rest of the year. During the quarter, some markets improved sequentially while other markets faced macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions that impacted consumer confidence and consumption behaviors. Despite this backdrop, we delivered robust organic revenue growth. Through our stepped-up capabilities and better-than-ever system alignment, we're getting more granular and tailoring our execution to win locally in key geographies, categories, and channels. During the quarter, we grew volume across all global beverage categories. We won value share by three key metrics: overall share, at home, and away from home.\nHowever, as we look across our top country category combinations, we still have opportunities to further improve our performance. Across our markets, we leveraged our global scale and local expertise to respond to complex dynamics in the quarter. In North America, we grew revenue and profit and won value share, but we were not satisfied with our volume performance. In addition to challenges with severe weather and calendar shifts, volume was impacted by weakening consumer sentiment as the quarter progressed, particularly among Hispanic consumers. Bright spots include continued volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, another good quarter for fairlife and Topo Chico Sabores, and continued traction with food service customer renewals and new accounts. Our system has quickly pivoted to prioritize the most impactful investment opportunities and is emphasizing faster decision-making and greater agility to accelerate volume growth.\nIn Latin America, while volume was flat, we grew both organic revenue and comparable currency-neutral operating income. Brazil and Argentina had strong volume performance, while momentum in Mexico was weaker due to cycling strong volume growth in the prior year, calendar shifts, and diminished consumer sentiment, partly stemming from geopolitical tensions. Our system has taken swift action in Mexico. We've learned from best practices in other markets by messaging affordability with value packages in key channels and by launching the Hecho en México campaign to further build trust with consumers. Across Latin America, our system is leveraging connected packaging and digital customer platforms to drive long-term growth. In EMEA, we grew volume, organic revenue, and comparable currency-neutral operating income. In Europe, volume declined with mixed performance in both Western and Eastern markets due to a range of factors.\nTo drive demand for our brands, we're focused on affordability and launching impactful integrated marketing activations. For example, with trademark Coca-Cola, we launched the Everyday Tasty Celebrations campaign for the meal occasions in over 20 markets, leveraging local influencers. For Fanta, we launched a partnership with Xbox to recruit Gen Z drinkers. In Eurasia and the Middle East, we drove strong volume growth and won value share. In Türkiye, despite continued external challenges, our business performance improved. We're leveraging our learnings from the past year to better understand consumer motivations and pivot during shifts in demand. Our efforts across the region to emphasize the localness of our system while driving affordability and partnering closely with customers are taking hold. Lastly, in Africa, we grew volume despite cycling strong growth in the prior year and dealing with double-digit inflation.\nWe're driving affordability with refillable offerings and value packages, and we're engaging consumers by scaling global integrated marketing campaigns at a local level, including Want a Fanta, Sprite Spicy Meals, and Schweppes Born Social 2.0. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we delivered volume, organic revenue, and comparable currency-neutral operating income growth. In ASEAN and South Pacific, volume declined as strong performance in the Philippines was more than offset by weaker performance in Thailand and Indonesia. However, we won value share in the region. We're focused on driving affordability with refillable offerings and attractive absolute price points, increasing outlet coverage and accelerating placement of cold drink equipment. In China, our system focus on improving execution is paying off and led to volume growth. We delivered impactful integrated marketing activations around the Lunar New Year and invested to drive growth in away-from-home channels.\nTrademark Coca-Cola had strong volume performance while Sprite is getting back on track. In India, we had strong volume growth across our portfolio of global and local brands. Our system added nearly 350,000 outlets and increased household penetration. Also, our system increased cooler placement and added approximately 100,000 customers to its digital customer platforms. In Japan and South Korea, we drove volume growth and won value share with strong performance from Ayataka. Our system is benefiting from stepped-up execution across key channels. Putting it all together, our business proved to be resilient during the quarter, and we're prepared to respond to changing consumer dynamics as our external environment continues to evolve. While we're navigating near-term market dynamics, we're focused on capturing the boundless opportunities we discussed at CAGNY, and we're building capabilities to further our strategic edge.\nStarting with our portfolio of loved brands, our total beverage portfolio offers consumers choice, whether it be by brand, package size, or package type. We have 30 global and local billion-dollar brands that address a broad range of consumer need states and drinking occasions. 30% of our volume is from low or no-calorie beverages, and 68% of our products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving. We also have a diversified mix of affordable and premium offerings. By staying consumer-centric and offering choice, we're seeing growth across multiple elements of our portfolio. Moving on to our marketing and innovation agenda, our ongoing transformation continues to fuel our top-line growth. With Studio X, we're producing tailored digital marketing at scale and with speed, and we're measuring the impact in real time.\nFor example, during Lunar New Year, we scaled an integrated campaign with trademark Coca-Cola across China, Japan, Vietnam, and other Asia Pacific markets. Consumers access personalized digital experiences through our systems-connected packaging. The campaign leveraged social media, live events, and increased displays in customer outlets, contributing to trademark Coca-Cola volume growth in Asia Pacific during the quarter. We're also excited about the global return of our iconic Share a Coke campaign. The 2025 iteration of this campaign offers digital experiences and increased shareability and customization. The return of Share a Coke is the first chance for Gen Z to experience this much-loved campaign. We're investing in multi-year innovations and prioritizing fewer but bolder launches to drive greater impact and improve our success rates. For example, we're continuing to invest in Fuze Tea, which contributed to value share gains in the category during the quarter.\nWe expanded Fuze Tea Sabor Original to Spain and Fuze Iced Tea to Canada. In the US, Coca-Cola Orange Cream is off to a good start with approximately $50 million in retail sales during the quarter. At the end of February, we launched Simply Pop, our first prebiotic soda in select locations and channels across the country. We're excited about our ability to test and learn and scale successes over time. Lastly, we're striving to optimize our broader ecosystem. This extends far beyond the company and our bottling partners. If you include our suppliers, approximately 6 million people service our ecosystem. Coca-Cola is for everyone, and we strive to contribute to each of the communities we serve. We believe our franchise model, which leverages global scale but prioritizes locally, is an advantage in today's environment. Our system primarily produces and distributes our brands locally.\nWe also aim to procure locally where possible. Much of the value we create in terms of jobs and retail sales stays in the local markets. For example, according to a recent economic impact study by Stewards Redqueen in the US, our ecosystem contributes approximately 860,000 jobs and approximately $58 billion to annual gross domestic product. In Brazil, our ecosystem contributes approximately 575,000 jobs and over $15 billion annually to the gross domestic product. While it is reasonable to assume global trade tensions and broader macro uncertainty may persist in the near term and could impact consumer sentiment, the building blocks behind our long-term growth opportunities are unchanged. We continue to benefit from three primary factors. Firstly, we operate in a resilient industry with predictable growth. Second, while barriers to entry in our industry are low, barriers to scale in our industry are high.\nLastly, we have significant headroom to develop our industry and gain share. We believe we're primed to capture these opportunities. Our portfolio power, as demonstrated by our $30 billion brands and pervasive yet local distribution, are key differentiators. Our system continues to prioritize agility, consumer centricity, and close partnership across our ecosystem to drive long-term growth. In summary, it's early in the year, and we know that the external environment is dynamic. Enabled by our all-weather strategy, we'll continue to expand our toolkit to respond to the opportunities and challenges ahead. Thanks to the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we are confident we can achieve our objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we pivoted as needed to continue delivering on our objectives.\nWe grew organic revenues 6%, which reflects performance at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Unit case growth was 2%, in line with our multi-year trend. Concentrate sales were one point behind unit case sales, as the impact of two fewer days in the quarter was partially offset by the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price mix growth of 5% was driven primarily by pricing actions across our markets, partially offset by approximately one point of unfavorable mix. Pricing from intense inflationary markets contributed to approximately one point of price mix growth, down from approximately five points in full year 2024. Comparable gross margin increased approximately 30 basis points, and comparable operating margin increased approximately 130 basis points. Both were driven by underlying expansion, and a benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by currency headwinds.\nPutting it all together, Q1 comparable EPS of $0.73 increased 1% year-over-year, despite 5% currency headwinds, dilution from bottler refranchising, elevated net interest expense, and an approximate two-point increase in our effective tax rate. Free cash flow, excluding the fairlife contingent consideration payment, was approximately $560 million, an increase versus prior year. During the quarter, we made our final $6.2 billion payment related to our acquisition of fairlife, which continued to deliver strong performance. We're expecting fairlife's growth to moderate during the remainder of 2025, in advance of bringing additional capacity online. Our balance sheet remained strong, with our net debt leverage of 2.1 times EBITDA, which is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times.\nWe're confident in our long-term free cash flow generation and continue to have balance sheet capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda, which prioritizes an unwavering commitment to drive growth and support our dividend while staying flexible and opportunistic. Before I discuss our guidance, I'd like to provide perspective on the current global trade environment and the actions we're taking to manage our business. While our system primarily executes locally, we're not immune to global trade dynamics. Based on what we know today, the dynamic tariff landscape could impact pockets of our system's cost structure, as well as consumer sentiment in our markets. At this time, we believe we have numerous levers to help manage the impact, which is contributing to our current 2025 guidance. Enabled by our all-weather strategy, we believe our business model has the flexibility needed to allow us to deliver on our near-term commitments.\nOur current 2025 guidance takes into consideration the underlying momentum of our business and what we know today about our external environment. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of 5 to 6%, but now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7 to 9%, both of which reflect delivery in line with our long-term growth algorithm. Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a slight headwind to comparable net revenues and comparable earnings per share. Most of the impact of Bottler refranchising occurred during the Q1 of this year, as we cycled the impact of refranchising the Philippines, which closed during the Q1 of 2024. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate 2 to 3 point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 5 to 6 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2025.\nOur underlying effective tax rate for 2025 is still expected to be 20.8%, which is over a two-point increase versus prior year. All in, based on what we know today, we continue to expect 2025 comparable earnings per share growth of 2 to 3% versus $2.88 in 2024. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2025. During Q2, we are cycling a tougher volume comparison from the prior year. While we're taking action to address consumer dynamics across some key markets and are seeing encouraging signs, we expect recovery to take some time. We continue to expect the productivity benefits that I discussed in February to be weighted towards H2 2025. Last, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in Q4.\nTo sum it up, we remain focused on the execution of our all-weather strategy and are well positioned, despite macro complexity and uncertainty in the remainder of 2025. Thanks to the power of our portfolio and the partnership of our system, we're confident we will continue to create enduring value for our stakeholders. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press Star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press Star one again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning.\nAnother strong quarter, clearly in Q1, but you did maintain the all-in full year 2025 earnings guidance, which implies constant currency earnings growth is now lower by 100 basis points, with FX improving. So is that just because it's early in the year and in a difficult environment, it doesn't make sense to raise overall earnings, particularly with volatile currency, or are there discrete factors that are incremental as we think about full year currency-neutral earnings? And maybe I can just extend that question also to unit cases. 2%, great result in the quarter. Comps do get tougher going forward. There's some geopolitical risk in theory. So just any thoughts around your ability to drive continued corporate unit case growth going forward in this more difficult environment that you referenced? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Dara.\nOn the currency front, as we said in the script, the currency guidance is based on current rates and hedge positions. It's early in the year. We have most of our G10 pretty much hedged, but there's still a lot of volatility out there with emerging markets. We are being, I think, prudent to not get slowed through. I am sure there's more to come in the coming months on the currency front, particularly in the emerging world. On unit case volume, not dissimilar. We have had an overall strong start when you look at the global portfolio, thanks to the strength of that portfolio. I highlighted in my script remarks, as you just alluded to, we're cycling a strong Q2. We have had a number of actions to address some of the challenges we've seen in the Q1.\nWe expect those actions to have an impact, but it will not be immediate. So I'd highlight the full year guidance we feel comfortable and confident with. Like we've seen over the last, I'd say, 12 to 13 quarters, each quarter has its own personality nowadays. So I'd look at the full year versus, let's say, the dynamics of any one quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. John, I'm still trying to figure out, it's the first time I've heard quarters described as having personality. So I'm trying to understand what personality this quarter might have been. But just can we talk a little bit about Mexico? The quarter was, I think, a little bit softer.\nAlso, I think you talked about market share gain or market share losses. So maybe can we talk a little bit about the current conditions there? I know last year there was some noise with the consumer around the election. So just what's happening with the consumer there, and perhaps what actions you're going to take, what you're planning to take going forward to restart buying growth.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Firstly, stepping back a bit, I mean, Latin America had a reasonable quarter. There was strong growth in Brazil and particularly Argentina. Yes, as you say, it was a bit softer in Mexico. There are a few things that went into that softness in Mexico. It's cycling a stronger first half from last year.\nAnd Easter being an important holiday in Mexico, that shifted effectively from Q1 to the end of April, effectively Q2. So that's the first piece. Second piece, there was some macro uncertainty coming into the year post-election, the local and Mexican elections, and some geopolitical tension. We called out some of the pullback in Hispanic consumers in the US as part of on the line, one of the factors in the US volume. That is also the same thing that's happening in Mexico, in northern Mexico, that there's some of the geopolitical tension and Hispanic pullback also affected the Mexican, particularly the border region, which is very connected to the US. And so you've got that as well. And so there was a couple of impacts there coming. We had some pretty good bright spots on Coke Zero, Del Valle, Santa Clara, and Fuze.\nBut we're very focused going into Q2 on affordability with refillables and value, reinforcing Hecho en Mexico, which is a campaign about the localness, the tens of thousands of jobs in Mexico that are about our Mexican system, and partnering closely with the fragmented trade. So I think we'll come back. As John said, each quarter will have its own personality. I'm not sure what Q2 we'll end up with, but choppy would be a good start. We're confident in our guidance because we're confident in our strategy and the system's execution of that all-weather strategy. And so I think we'll come back in Mexico and we'll pull it back.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. So I want to talk a little bit more perhaps about the actions you're taking in the US.\nYou called out consumer softness, particular demographics, but there was also some pretty pointed anti-Coke, brand Coke sentiment out there. So I was just curious if anything you could share or articulate on what the system is doing to manage through that. So yeah, that's the key question. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. I mean, clearly the key is agility and reprioritization, refocusing on some of the issues within the context of a strategy that has been working for us in the US marketplace. I mean, we have been very focused on driving the portfolio and upping the execution with our bottling partners, and that's been a multi-quarter, multi-year successful strategy. So within the context of continuing that, we're going to make some adjustments to what's happened in the Q1. Just standing back a second and saying what happened, there were a whole set of things that came together.\nThere's a shift in Easter, which I mentioned regarding Mexico and the weakness in some of the consumer traffic, particularly Hispanic traffic. There was some very unfortunate videos circulating around, false, completely false, but they impact the business. That hit us, particularly Coke Original in the southern states. That is a basic. But there were other things like cold weather and some of the calendar shifts. So there were some known factors. There were some unfortunate factors, and there's some stuff that we got to focus on so that we can build on what went well. Coke Zero was still growing. Fairlife was still the number one brand to add retail dollars in Q1. Topo Chico's going well. So we have a lot to build on. We focused on coming back on Coke Original.\nWe're focusing in on winning back some of the Hispanic consumers, both from a consumer and a channel point of view, and reinforcing some of our affordability options. So I think we're going to, again, come back. Might be choppy again going into Q2, but we feel we have a handle on the controllable and can get ourselves back on track to our winning strategy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, great. Thanks. So James, as you emphasized in the prepared remarks, the company's portfolio is made up of a broad mix of both global and local brands.\nGiven some of the shifts you've seen in demand since we were all together at CAGNY in February, could you talk maybe about how you're leaning more into some of those local brands in the current environment to the extent that you are, or perhaps how you're executing or positioning differently some of your global brands to emphasize their local relevance?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. And let me start by emphasizing the nature of the Coke system globally. Obviously, we're iconically known for Coca-Cola, the world's most global brand, and a set of other global brands. But along with that headline globalness, actually, it's a very profoundly local business. The beverages in each country are largely made in that country by local employees using local inputs.\nSo the US system, for example, between the people we employ directly and the economic jobs that come through the supply chain and total ecosystem, it's like 860,000 people and $58 billion of GDP. You go to Brazil, same, 575,000 people, $15 billion of GDP. So it's a very profoundly local business, as much as it looks like a global business. And so the paradox that gets managed productively from our point of view is how do we make global brands locally relevant? So it's not that we, in this current context, are switching from supporting and investing behind the global brands into just local brands. No. The trick, the imperative, is to make the global brands locally relevant. And in the moments of geopolitical tension, one of the key strategies is to drive and reinforce the made-in or made-by it.\nThe fact that it's a local business, the factory is down the road from you, your neighbors make the product. And this underlining of the localness of the production, the distribution, and the workforce, plus reinforcing affordability, tends to be the key thing to do, particularly with brand Coca-Cola in these moments. So I would not expect to see any major shifts in the makeup from a global brand or from a brand portfolio sense as we go forward. It's about how you engage locally to reinforce the global nature of the brand, but the local physical presence of the brand. And that's what works in these circumstances. And it's a best practice that we know from around the world. It's not the first time it's had to be used. I'm sure it won't be the last.\nSo we think our business model is set up for an environment that can take a degree of disturbance because it's a very resilient business model.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you about your comment about the global trade dynamics. You mentioned that your operations are primarily local. But what are the portion of your business where you're actually seeing the tariff implication impacting your business? Any sense, if you can, give us a sense of quantifying the potential impact? I know aluminum is a component, but just any broader comment on the implication from the global trade environment. And then a follow-up to that in the sense of the responses to just a general anti-American brand sentiment around the world from the global trade disputes.\nAre there any countries other than Mexico, which you called out, where you're seeing a little bit more of negative sentiment towards American brands? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. I'll take the second piece first because it's very much linked to my previous answer, which is about reinforcing localness and really making sure we're on affordability and getting that really working and focused on driving the execution of that strategy. I'm not sure I would call out many other places. Obviously, there have been countries that have cycled through this problem over the last number of years. I'm sure there'll be more. I think the predominant issues have been, as we've seen this quarter so far, in the US, in Mexico, a little bit perhaps in Europe, and some of the other countries. But one has to parse apart sentiment from behavior.\nAnd therefore, it's very important that we're not responding to sentiment. We're responding to behavior. Turning back to the tariff dynamic, as we called out in our release, we see it as manageable. Obviously, we're not immune to global trade dynamics. And we're talking now, knowing what we know today. And we're mindful the environment can change around us. Again, as I said before, I think our local franchise structure is an advantage. Our exposure to trade, import-export, is not massive in the major countries relative to our cost structure. So if we were to take the US, for example, we are exposed on a couple of inputs like orange juice or some of the dispensing equipment we buy. Our bottling system is a bit exposed to some of the resin and aluminum. But these are small pieces relative to the total size.\nEven if you focus just in on those elements exclusively and think about what impact they may have on marketplace pricing, you don't just have to take into account the tariff. You've got to take into account, well, what's happened to the price of the underlying commodity? What's happened to the exchange rate from where you're buying it? What's happened to our hedging positions? Because we have long-term hedging positions. See, when you put all those things together and all the other levers across the cost elements of the business, that's how we and the bottling partners locally make the decisions on pricing. When it comes to the US, given all the things I talked about, both we in the business where we operate directly and the bottlers locally, we're sticking to our current pricing plans for the year and knowing what we know today.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, everybody. I wanted to ask a question about margins and specifically operating margins. I think this is the best operating margin delivery going back in our model, I suppose, the modern era. I don't know if they were 100 years ago, but let's say these are very, very strong operating margins. To what level are such margins sustainable? And do you envision any caveats in the quarter? I know you talked about marketing, timing. And then just connected to that, as you think about reigniting trends in some of your developed markets, North America, Europe, is there a scenario whereby you would need to use some of this margin strength to drive that?\nOr is the price pack and RGM strategy strong enough that you can still offer affordability without sacrificing the margin strength? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Chris. Yes, pleased with where we came out of Q1 on the operating margin front. There is an element of timing in there that has benefited us. I would step out of the quarter, point to our longer-term algorithm, and the embedded in that our belief in our ability to expand margins over time. As you know, we have made a lot of progress over the last five or six years to get to where we are north of 30, 31 as we go into the rest of this year. And we expect to be able to do that with the levers we have. And those levers are not just on the cost containment and management front.\nAs you mentioned in your second question, they also flow through to being able to manage a quality top line over time. And with regard to the investment thesis, we have to enable both the top and the margin line to expand in line with our algorithm: a combination of the buildup over the last few years of a substantial spend behind our portfolio and the opportunity to leverage further productivity that we know we have over the next few years, we feel good about our ability to lean into growth, to invest behind the brands, and to adapt as we need to. This quarter is a good example of a quarter where there's been a lot of adaptation required to deliver the numbers we have delivered for the here and now.\nBut we're confident that we have sufficient ammunition to be able to do that for the next number of quarters, and embedded in that an assumption that we'll probably have to pivot again in some part of the world or other.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRob Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of the Global Beverages and Household Products Team, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. You mentioned in the opening comments that fairlife growth may moderate. And fairlife and Core Power have been a phenomenal success.\nSo I'm wondering if you can, one, talk about the trajectory of that business starting now with the service levels you have, when the capacity will come on, a sense of how much capacity is coming on, and where you see that brand going forward in terms of how big it could get, and then also how you're going to protect that brand from an intellectual property perspective. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Thanks, Rob. Firstly, when we talk about the the growth moderating of fairlife, we're very much focusing on the percent growth. And I think there you're starting to see the law of big numbers. It's starting to get to be a very big business as it's compounded very, very high double-digit percent growth rates over the last number of years. So it's a comment relative to percentages rather than total business size.\nIf you look, as I commented earlier, in Q1 of this year, fairlife again was the brand that added most retail dollars to the beverage industry on top of doing so last year. The dollars, the robustness, and the size of the business continues to grow substantially. It's just a percentage compounding question as it moderates a little. The capacity will come on towards the end. We've been increasing capacity in a number of different places in some of the existing locations. The major capacity uplift will happen at the end of the year. It'll be more than enough to see us through a good number of years and certainly will make it unconstrained to the extent we get into that towards the end of the year. The long-term opportunity, I think, is still very substantial.\nThere's a lot. I mean, it's got a lot of reasons behind its underlying growth in terms of the quality of the product, the quality of the taste, the quality of the shelf life, the low or no lactose, the higher. I mean, it's just a great product on many dimensions, which is part of what gives it a competitive advantage. It doesn't just depend on any one piece, including the IP and the technology that comes with it for the filtration. So it is a very strong business. Obviously, as we get into lots of extra headroom in terms of capacity, we can redouble down on marketing, innovation, and really continue to drive and expand that business.\nSo we've kept it in the swim lanes of Core Power products at the moment because that's the most effective thing to do when you're running such growth rates and risk running out of capacity. Obviously, we haven't because we're continuing to grow in Q1. But we will get soon into unconstrained opportunity to continue to really drive this master brand forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you, Operator. And good morning, everyone. So I'll start with James and then a clarification for John. First, James, can you comment on Europe, Middle East, and Africa? You had the 3% growth in unit volume. And I'm assuming, of course, there's a lot of different dynamics given how large the region is.\nBut can you comment on the performance of Western Europe, which is a very large component of your profit pool as you exited the quarter? As some CPG, as you probably have been following, have been calling a deceleration in the consumer dynamics there as well. And then a clarification for John on the underlying results. I mean, it seems that the effects came in or the outlook is 100 basis points better, but it seems that the underlying profit is assumed to be 100 basis points worse to make for the all-in comparable EPS to be the same. So can you comment on what got sequentially worse? So is that some you're embedding some of the risk of more punitive trading news or just conservatives despite the strong start of the year? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Let me get the clarification out of the way. Andrea, thanks for the question.\nIt's early in the year. Currency is a function of what we know today and our hedge positions. There's still a long way to go. So we feel it's prudent at this juncture to guide as we have done so. We'll continue to update on the currency front as we go through the year.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. In the EMEA segment, yes, the volume growth was principally driven by the Eurasia markets, actually including some of the North African ones. It was a strong performance, particularly by the Eurasian market. The European business specifically, as you say, calling out, it's a good profit pool. There, the volume performance was actually in line with previous quarters. There were mixed performances between the East and the West, maybe the West a little softer.\nAgain, Europe has some of the factors that we talked about in the case of the US and Mexico, the shift of Easter, some of the macro uncertainties, and the political tensions. But again, just one quarter in line, it was very similar to what they were tracking from last year in terms of volume performance. And there were some really strong bright spots in things like Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, Fuze Tea, Powerade, and some really good marketing across not just Coke with Everyday Tasty Celebrations and things, but partnerships with Xbox and Fanta. And as we look forward, we're really going to continue to focus on some of the RGM and affordability and the availability of cold drink equipment going into what is, for Europe, the most important season, which is the summer season.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nPlease go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick question on the Away From Home channel and consumer. Curious to hear how your Away From Home business trended in the quarter versus even Q4. And then what's your outlook for the channel this year, given the consumer. And then with that in mind, how should we think about the impact on your top line and margins if the Away From Home channel slows? And is that factored in your guidance? Thanks. Okay. Are you talking just US or globally? Honestly, globally. But if you want to give some color on the US as well, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Look, I think let's start with the US.\nI mean, in the US, actually, immediate consumption actually held up better than future consumption. Some of the issues, particularly some of the pullbacks in consumers, was more concentrated in the take-home channel. So if we were to look at the North American business, our business actually did reasonably well. And the future consumption business is where the impact was most felt. Similarly, in Europe, the impact was more on the future consumption. The IC was actually growing in Europe. And I think that calls out the importance of affordability in the retail channels. And I think that's what it's reflecting. And that's notwithstanding some of the geopolitics. That's what it's reflecting. And that's what it's calling for in the months going forward.\nThen if you extract that to a global basis, both at home and away from home were both growing, globally speaking, with away from home growing slightly faster than at home. On a global basis, looking good. Strong activations across a number of places, particularly Asia Pacific, where away from home grew really strongly. The bit that was a little bit more of the drag is the developed markets, particularly US and Europe. It was in the future consumption where there was a bit of weakness, which, as I said, calls for working with the retail customers on some affordability to really drive solutions there.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director of Beverage, Household Products, and HALO Strategy, Jefferies\n\nHey, everybody. Good morning.\nIf I can ask a question on currency, maybe slightly differently. Since John and James's arrival, it's been about dollar-based growth and worked very hard to be able to grow earnings in dollar terms. We may be coming towards the end of a strong dollar supercycle. And I'm curious, to what degree are you contemplating that? And does it change how you're thinking about future investments, capital returns, things like that? 20 times. 20 seconds.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. We're not quite there yet, Kaumil, on celebrating the demise of the dollar. But we will continue to stay very focused on our core objective to grow US dollar EPS. If there is a scenario over time whereby the dollar weakens to the extent that it impacts our total portfolio of currencies, we would expect to flow that through. And we have that scenario in our pipeline.\nIt's not the foremost scenario we have at the moment because I think some of the headlines on dollar weakness are really linked to the US dollar index, which covers only six currencies and the heavy weighting towards the euro. So, for example, four of our top five market currencies are not covered in that index. So I think the way we are looking at the US dollar at the moment is in the context of our total currency basket and as reflected in our guidance. And if there is a significant change, of course, on that front in the course of this year, we'll adjust accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNik Modi\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, James, I just wanted to get your thoughts on innovation in the wellness and functional space.\nThere's a growing popularity of ingredients like ashwagandha, lion's mane, and turmeric, among others, in the US. Many of these ingredients have some science backing on health and other functional benefits. So just wanted to get an understanding how you're thinking about using these products or ingredients in terms of your innovation in the US. Do you need clinical studies to support some of the health claims? A lot of these ingredients are used a lot overseas. And so given your global exposure, just curious on how you're thinking about this in terms of the US, especially as the population is aging. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Clearly, from a firstly, we're going to follow the consumer. And I think there are a couple of pieces to that.\nOne is, what do they really want and how are they really behaving in terms of where they want to spend their money? The second piece that goes with that is, do they want product combinations? In other words, whatever the ingredient on your list is, do they want to take it through their beverage, or do they want it a different way? I'm going somewhere with that. Because at the end of the day, they generally want their beverages to taste good. Adding certain ingredients affects the taste. Taste is, in my mind, still going to remain primary. To the extent there are consumers that are willing to trade taste for ingredients, absolutely, we'll follow that trend. You can go back and look in history.\nWe once did a product where we combined a tablet people were taking to give themselves what effectively was a fake suntan into a beverage. This was in France many years ago. I think it was with Sanofi. They came up with this idea of, well, people go to the pharmacy, they buy the Coke, or they buy the drink, and they buy the pills. Why not put it all together? It's what people do in France. When they did it, no one bought the drink. They were not interested in combining the drink and the pill. They wanted to take the pill when they wanted to take the pill, and they wanted to have the drink when they wanted the drink. So the idea that everything is going to mega combine into one overall product, I think, is something yet to be tested.\nClearly, there are segments of consumers that are interested in certain ingredients, and they will go, and they will try them, and they'll be happy to have them in their beverage. And I think you see a little progress on that. I think it's more likely it'll be around macro ingredients like protein rather than more focused ones. And the last thing is, I don't think we're in the business of running clinical studies to the extent there are ingredients that we want to use. For sure, we're interested in absolute product safety and quality. And then we may buy them in from someone else to use. But we will continue to follow the consumer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Graham from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Graham\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the Q2 commentary.\nIt was flagged back in February. I know the world is clearly quite different today versus when you provided that outlook. But have your expectations for the Q2 shifted? James, you mentioned the word choppy a couple of times. So I just wasn't sure if the Q2 comment was based on some of the performance you've seen thus far in April, or what you're expecting looking ahead, or whether it's simply just a reminder on the comparisons. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Sure. I think, firstly, it's a reminder on the comparisons that it was the strongest quarter last year. So clearly, it's going to be more complicated just on a cycling basis to cycle, although we still want to do well in Q2. And as John said earlier, it's one of the four quarters that goes to make up our full-year guidance.\nSo it's clearly got to play its role and have its personality, so to speak, in delivering the full year. The only thing that I would add relative to our previous commentary on Q2 is, clearly, which references my choppy comment, there's clearly some short-term disruption in supply chains likely in the US. I think the simplest way of bringing that to life is looking at container shipping bookings for late May, early June. Again, back to my earlier comment, it's not because it drives and impacts our business. We are not expecting to see supply chain disruptions for our business in Q2 in the US. But I think there's going to be some disruption around a number of categories and industries around us, which will have some effect with the consumers. You can see the consumer sentiment has been impacted, but consumer spending still seems robust.\nSo I would just highlight there's an increased number of known unknowns, if you like, going into Q2, which is likely to produce a broader range of choppiness that we're going to have to respond to. And that's, I think, the texture I would add on to the previous comments. But again, let me underline what we both said earlier, which is we believe it's manageable given our business system, our strategy, and our ability to adapt as we go through the quarter and the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nDirector, Redburn",
    "content2": "Yeah. Hi, James. John, hope you're both well. I've got a question on Asia-Pacific volumes. I'm just wondering if you could unpack the +6% a bit more, but perhaps with a focus on China and how you're feeling about the consumer environment there.\nI know a lot of other consumer staples companies have spoken of a deflationary environment. So how do you feel about the consumer, but also your now rationalized portfolio in China and the execution by the local bottlers there? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Sure. Thanks, Charlie. Look, we had good momentum in Asia Pacific this quarter with the 6% volume growth. That was very strongly driven by a good quarter in India in particular, also with China growing. As you called out, I think the China growth is a function of a number of the actions we were taking last year to focus the portfolio and re-stage some of the brands. We've Coke doing better. Good Lunar New Year. Sprite a little more of a work in progress. So good recovery there.\nPerhaps still early to call, but with continued focus on the soft drink portfolio in China and a good growth right there. As I said, India, really good start to the year as we brought to activate a number of things in the marketplace there and grew customers and cold drink equipment. Our long-term thesis remains intact. Obviously, it's not necessarily always going to be a straight line. A decent result in Japan and South Korea. Japan continuing to grow. Some softness in ASEAN, but we're focused on working through that. So hopefully, that unpacks it a little bit for you.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nDirector, Redburn\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question.\nI wanted to follow up on Chris's margin question from earlier, but more from a North America perspective and within the context of striking the right balance with volume growth. So North America margins clearly very strong, 30%. Historically, that's quite good. Price mix has been up materially the past four years. That was the case again in Q1. Yet volumes have been flattish the past couple of years and took a step back in the Q1 for the reasons that we talked about. So, James, can you comment on striking the right balance in North America between margin delivery and perhaps higher levels of volume growth and how that may differ in terms of how the company's going to go about that tactically in the near term given the uneven macro and then more in the intermediate term in a more normalized environment?\nSo thanks for that.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nLet me take this one. Yes. So in North America, if I step out of the quarter for a moment first, we have been on a journey for the last three to four years now of consistently improving the overall margin profile of our business in North America. And that has been driven by a stronger core business, a much better revenue growth management approach in that core business. And then we've had the addition of Fairlife into the portfolio that has helped it. So I think you should think about North America in that context, that we continue to see opportunity to improve that margin profile to be more in line with what we have in other parts of the world, the developed world particularly. And so there's a keen focus on leaning into the growth opportunity to investing behind that.\nBut we also have had for some time now as a core enterprise priority for North America to play a more important and a bigger role in our overall quest, to one of the earlier questions, to get our overall operating margin back to levels which we are excited to see in the 30s.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. Also just looking at margins and keeping in mind last quarter, you touched on some SG&A leverage, calling out some better marketing productivity. One of the examples you gave was using some generative AI in working media or the non-working, the development of ads, which conceptually is straightforward enough.\nBut in terms of just the total spend, what outcomes do you focus on to know where the right level is and to make sure that the productivity is just efficiency and not reducing any effectiveness? And how do you look? How do you see that playing out as you're making a push to get more efficient this year? So maybe I can start.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. I think we're very focused on the activities that are needed to support the portfolio. And then working backwards from there, what is the most efficient way to execute those activities versus looking at the other way around and trying to drive efficiency through cutbacks or through taking a blunt weapon at them? So the approach has changed pretty significantly over the last few years to be, as I say, activity-driven.\nWe have a pretty clear understanding as to where the opportunities exist to drive more efficiency. So, for example, the relationship between the amount we spend on creative work versus the amount that we spend on engaging with those creatives is something that is a high priority. We have work underway to get that to optimal levels, and we're confident that we can do so. The use of new technology to be able to do activities which in the analog world were more expensive and took a longer time to happen is something that we're embedding more and more into the marketing equation. The way in which we are planning our media using a much more sophisticated data set, etc., etc., is another opportunity to create the same, if not higher impact, more efficiently.\nSo I think the name of the game is focus on the activities and then challenge ourselves as to how those activities can be delivered either faster, cheaper, or both.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just a quick question. Could you remind us what your business looked like in both Ukraine and Russia four or five years ago, what it looks like today, and if there was peace there, what could look like down the road?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. I mean, four or five years ago when we pulled out our brands, I think we called out it was about a 1 to 2% of revenue and a similar amount of profits.\nSo that's what we left on the table when we pulled out whenever that was a few years ago. The Ukraine is a much smaller business. Obviously, it's been impacted by the war, but it was a good business. We liked the market, but it's not so big. I think any thoughts on the future are at this stage premature. There's a long way to go to get from A to B, and I think a lot of water has to pass under the bridge.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thank you. James and John, could you be a little more specific as to where you think you are on clearing up the misconceptions about trademark Coke that impacted Q1?\nSecondly, maybe a little more detail on the state of the Hispanic consumer. You're uniquely capable of evaluating how those consumers are thinking, how they're spending in home, away from home. Can you touch on those two things?\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Look, I think as it relates very specifically, firstly, to the false video, I think that's largely in the rearview mirror in terms of its virality and affecting the business. It wasn't the first piece of misinformation, disinformation, or anything else nefarious about the Coca-Cola brand, and I'm sure it won't be the last. But we are very focused on recovering from it. I called out some of the actions, particularly around local economic impact, our connectivity to the values and events that those consumers care about, but also driving affordability with some tailored promotions and value channels.\nThe overall state of the Hispanic consumer, I think partly there was this video, so let's just leave that one aside for now. I think there was a little bit of pullback in purchasing and in traffic, not just on the US side of the border. Remember that there's a significant portion of the industrial footprint in northern Mexico which provides exports. I mean, the highly integrated nature of the supply chain between northern Mexico and the US. I think some of the geopolitical tension was just causing people to be a little more cautious with their spend, a little less going out, a little more keeping the money in the pocket.\nI think that will, there's the shock of the event happening, and then it tends to abate, which was the comment on the US consumer of the difference between the marked difference between sentiment and actual spend. Obviously, that, as previously advertised, could be choppy in the near term as resolution occurs, but that's the general state. I think from our point of view, we've got to focus on our game plan, which is sticking to our all-weather strategy, focusing on the brands, the execution, the local connectivity, reinforcing the Made in the US for the US business and the Hecho en México for the Mexican business. I think that will see us through as we go through the balance of the year.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOkay. Thanks very much, everyone.\nTo summarize, enabled by our all-weather strategy, we're focused on prioritizing agility, remaining consumer-centric, and partnering closely across our ecosystem for the rest of the year. There'll be many types of environments, and we're going to leverage our capabilities to drive the growth and the enduring value. Thank you for your interest, for your investment in the company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under financial information in the investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Re-enter the queue to ask any follow-ups. Now I will turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our 2024 results, which include volume growth, robust organic revenue growth, and comparable gross and operating margin expansion. This led to a 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite nearly double-digit currency headwinds and the impact of bottler refranchising. These results reflect the continuation of delivering on our long-term commitments. Through our all-weather strategy, we've demonstrated we have agility to navigate what comes at us and continue to grow comparable earnings per share. Given the strong momentum of our business, we're confident we can deliver on our 2025 guidance and longer-term objectives. With that as context, I'll next provide perspective on our industry and review our business performance across our segments in the fourth quarter. Then I'll explain how we're executing our strategy by amplifying what is working and fine-tuning where needed.\nJohn will end by discussing our financial results in more detail and providing an overview of our 2025 guidance. One of our fundamental strengths is that we operate in a great industry with steady growth. No matter how you slice it, by consumer, by customer, by beverage category, by geography, we have vast opportunities ahead of us. During the quarter, we leveraged the power of our portfolio and the local expertise of our franchise system to capitalize on these opportunities. We won overall share and had broad-based share gains across our global beverage categories. We're making progress across our total beverage portfolio, delivering ongoing growth in sparkling soft drinks, as well as momentum in other categories like value-added dairy and tea, which are reaching global scale while remaining tailored to local consumer needs.\nAnd we're continuing to strengthen alignment across our system, and we believe our global franchise model, which operates locally, is an advantage to drive long-term balanced growth. During the quarter, while our operating environment remained dynamic, consumer demand held up well, and our industry remained strong. Starting in Asia Pacific, in ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew volume during the quarter and benefited from successful integrated marketing campaigns like Foodmarks, which was activated in over 7,000 outlets and led to trademark Coca-Cola volume growth. Our system also drove affordability by increasing refillable offerings and focusing on attractive price points. Refillable offerings contributed to approximately 1/3 of ASEAN and South Pacific volume growth in 2024. In China, despite continued macro headwinds, we grew volume during the quarter, and while early, we're seeing improved trends across our business.\nTrademark Coca-Cola continues to gain share, and Sprite, Fanta, and Minute Maid each improved volume performance. Our system is stepping up integrated execution in 2024 by accelerating placement of cold drink equipment and activating integrated marketing campaigns in key channels. In Japan and South Korea, we grew volume during the quarter. Innovation was a strong contributor to growth, led by resurgence of Ayataka and a number of other brands. We're continuing to benefit from steady performance from trademark Coca-Cola and stepped-up integrated execution in key channels. In India, our business rebounded nicely during the quarter, and we grew volume. We recruited consumers with innovative marketing campaigns that link Coca-Cola with music, Sprite with travel, and Thums Up with movies. Maaza is now our $30 billion brand.\nIn 2024, our system added approximately 440,000 outlets to our digital customer platforms in India, which provides more opportunities to better tailor our product, price, and packaging offerings. Moving on to EMEA. In Europe, volume declined during the quarter with mixed performance across Western and Eastern markets. Despite volume pressure, we grew both revenue and profits. We're engaging consumers with experiential marketing campaigns like \"The World Needs More Santas\" for trademark Coca-Cola and by linking our brands to new occasions like Sprite with spicy meals. Also, innovation velocities and multi-year innovation success rates both performed well in 2024. We're seeing good traction on Fuze Tea, Powerade Zero, Jack and Coke, and Absolut and Sprite. In Eurasia and Middle East, despite a confluence of continued macro headwinds, we returned to volume growth during the quarter. We're emphasizing the localizedness of our business and seeing positive responses.\nFor example, the Made In, Made By campaign in Türkiye led to strong volume growth for trademark Coca-Cola. Fuze Tea also had good momentum across the region. Our system is driving affordability and stepping up integrated execution by increasing cooler placement and share of visible inventory during the year. In Africa, volume declined during the quarter, driven primarily by pressure in North Africa, and Nigeria, and partially offset by strong volume momentum in South Africa. We took action during the quarter by adjusting our pack price architecture to further drive affordability. Our system is investing for the long term, adding refillable offerings, placing more cold drink equipment, and increasing manufacturing capacity in 2024. In Latin America, despite some macroeconomic pressures, we grew volume, revenue, and profit during the quarter.\nWe drove trial and recruited weekly plus drinkers for Trademark Coca-Cola in 2024 by better linking the brand to the meal occasion. Also, to drive balanced top-line growth, our system focused on increasing single-serve offerings. Over 90% of our fragmented trade customers are now on our system's digital customer platforms, allowing for greater opportunity to tailor offerings to customers' individual needs. Lastly, in North America, we grew both transactions and volume and had robust top-line and profit growth during the quarter. Trademark Coca-Cola and fairlife remain leaders in at-home retail sales growth. Sparkling flavors gained share during the quarter due to successful limited-time innovations like Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry, and Fanta Beetlejuice, and stepped-up integrated execution focused on increased point-of-sale messaging and increased share of visible inventory.\nConsumers responded well to value messaging in away-from-home channels, and we increased distribution of key affordable and premium offerings and benefited from product package and channel mix in the quarter. To sum everything up, we have good momentum in our business. We're responding to market dynamics locally to execute on our global objectives. While we're delivering on our near-term commitments, we're also investing to improve execution, build capabilities, and get more granular across our strategic growth flywheel. Our networked marketing model is integrating product, digital, live, and retail experiences, and we're harnessing passion points to connect with consumers in more personalized ways. One great example, Fanta Halloween, was our first-ever global Halloween activation and was scaled to nearly 50 markets. Partnering with Warner Bros. Pictures, we created a limited-time Fanta Beetlejuice haunted apple flavor.\nConsumers scanned packages to access personalized experiences, and we replicated the Beetlejuice afterlife train, taking over train stations, trams, and metros. The campaign was activated in-store with our largest customers and contributed to sparkling flavors' share gain during the quarter. Our culture increasingly emphasizes acting boldly, learning, and scaling successes. This year, for the first time, our Coca-Cola Christmas ad was created with generative AI, combining emerging technology with human creativity, which allowed us to produce the ad faster and at a lower cost. The power of emerging technologies like generative AI is still at early stages, and we will continue to lead and iterate our approach. We're seeing tangible results from our marketing transformation. Over the past three years, trademark Coca-Cola's retail sales have increased approximately $40 billion.\nAccording to TIME, Coca-Cola, Minute Maid, and fairlife were named world's best brands in their respective beverage categories in 2024. While we're building capabilities in marketing, we're also focusing on innovation that prioritizes bigger and bolder bets. Each of our innovations has a clear objective. Sometimes we innovate to create short-term buzz like Coke and Oreo or Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry. In other instances, we innovate for lasting impact. This year, we focused on sustaining investments behind key innovations to improve multi-year success rates and drive greater impact. This is paying off. As Fuze Tea grew retail value three times faster than the tea category, Topo Chico Sabores continued its momentum, and Minute Maid Zero Sugar realized strong growth. In 2024, innovation contributed strongly to revenue growth, and our innovation success rates improved versus prior year. We're excited about our innovation pipeline for 2025.\nMoving across our top-line flywheel, our system is investing heavily in digital capabilities and sticking to the fundamentals of commercial excellence to accelerate consumer recruitment, increase consumption, and win in the market. Ensuring product availability is one of our system's greatest strengths, yet we still have tremendous opportunity. While our system improved share of visible inventory in 2024 and our brands are found in 33 million outlets, there remains ample headroom to increase outlet coverage, reduce out-of-stocks, and better tailor our offerings with the right placements. Basket incidence is another opportunity. Winning just one point of global beverage incidence translates into over $40 billion in additional retail sales. To drive basket incidence, our system is focused on better activating integrated marketing campaigns in key channels, increasing point-of-sale displays, and winning impulse zones outside the traditional beverage aisle.\nFinally, cold drink equipment is one of the strongest consumption drivers in our system's toolbox. With approximately 14 million units of cold drink equipment present in our approximately 33 million customer outlets, we have significant opportunity to drive consumption by placing more cold drink equipment. In 2024, our system invested to add nearly 600,000 coolers. Strong commercial execution is enabled by our revenue growth management capabilities, which fuel both top-line growth and margin expansion. We're driving affordability and premiumization across our total beverage portfolio. The strong elasticities we're realizing today are a testament to the progress we're making in this area. By focusing on availability, basket incidents, and cold drink equipment, coupled with great marketing, innovation, and revenue growth management, our system recruited weekly plus drinkers, grew volume, and won share in 2024.\nWhile we've made steady progress executing our all-weather strategy in 2024, we're operating with the mindset that we're only just getting started. As we turn the page to 2025, we anticipate the year will bring both opportunities and challenges. While we expect the external environment will be dynamic, several underpinnings remain constant. One, we operate in a great industry. Two, we have many opportunities available to us, and we're primed to capture these and deliver sustained performance. Three, our powerful portfolio of brands, pervasive distribution system, and the unwavering dedication of our system employees are clear advantages. Next Tuesday at CAGNI, I look forward to sharing more about how we're leading to deliver results in all types of backdrops, and I encourage everyone to listen. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone.\nWe closed the year with strong fourth quarter results, and as James said earlier, we delivered 7% comparable earnings per share growth in 2024, on top of 6% average comparable earnings per share growth over the prior five years. During the fourth quarter, we grew organic revenues 14%. Unit case growth was 2%, which is in line with our multi-year trend. Concentrate sales grew three points ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by two additional days in the quarter and the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price mix growth of 9% was driven by two items. Approximately eight points of pricing split somewhat evenly between normal pricing actions across our markets and intense inflationary pricing in a handful of markets experiencing currency devaluations, and approximately one point of favorable mix. Excluding the impact of intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth was above our long-term growth algorithm.\nComparable gross margin was up approximately 160 basis points, and comparable operating margin was up approximately 80 basis points. Bottler refranchising had a greater benefit to comparable gross margin, and currency headwinds had a larger impact to comparable operating margin. Putting it all together, Q4 comparable EPS of $0.55 was up 12% year over year, despite 11% currency headwinds and 4% headwinds from bottler refranchising. Free cash flow, excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit, was $10.8 billion in 2024, an increase of 11% versus prior year. This increase was primarily driven by strong business performance, and timing of working capital initiatives, partially offset by higher capital expenditures, and higher tax payments. In 2024, adjusted free cash flow conversion was 93%, which is within our long-term targeted range.\nOur balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.8 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 time to 2.5x. If you include our latest estimate of $6.2 billion related to our fairlife contingent consideration payment, our expected net debt leverage would be at the low end of our target range. As James mentioned, 2025 will likely bring both opportunities and challenges. Enabled by our all-weather strategy, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver on our objectives and drive long-term growth. Our 2025 guidance builds on the enduring momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10%, both of which reflect delivery at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm.\nWe continue to focus on driving balanced volume and price mix, and anticipate intense inflationary pricing will play a smaller role in 2025 and will moderate throughout the year. Bottler refranchising is expected to be a slight headwind to comparable net revenues and comparable earnings per share as we cycle the impact of bottler refranchising in 2024. We continue to invest appropriately behind our brands while also driving productivity across all areas of marketing. Next week at CAGNI, we'll discuss further how our marketing transformation and enhanced resource allocation capabilities give us confidence in our ability to continue to drive more productivity. We expect interest expense to be elevated versus prior year. We believe the step-up is manageable, and we're not expecting significant leverage or deleverage below the line.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3 to 4-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 6 to 7-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2025. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2025 is expected to increase to 20.8%, which is driven primarily by the impact of several countries enacting the global minimum tax regulations. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 2 to 3% versus $2.88 in 2024. Excluding the fairlife contingent consideration payment, we expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2025 through approximately $11.7 billion in cash for operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments. Included in this guidance are two items to highlight. One, a $1.2 billion transition tax payment, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2024.\nThis is the final year that we will make a payment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Number two, we expect that part of the timing of working capital initiatives that benefited 2024 free cash flow will reverse and impact 2025 free cash flow. Driven by our underlying cash flow generation, we have flexibility to invest in our business and return capital to share owners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment is to build capacity for fairlife and to continue to invest in our system in India and Africa. With respect to acquisitions and divestitures, we're making good progress on our agenda. Since 2006, we've added $9 billion brands via acquisition. Importantly, only three of these brands were billion-dollar brands at the time of acquisition, demonstrating progress in scaling acquisitions. In 2024, we realized $3.5 billion in gross proceeds from refranchising.\nBottling investments as a percent of consolidated net revenue is 13%, down from 52% in 2015. Return on invested capital is up 6 points over the same time. Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend, as we've done for 62 consecutive years. Our dividend is supported by our long-term free cash flow generation. In 2024, dividends paid as a percent of adjusted free cash flow was 73%. On share repurchases, we've typically repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritizes agility, and we're committed to driving the long-term health of our business and creating value for our stakeholders. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2025.\nWe expect further refranchising to have a greater impact to comparable net revenues and comparable earnings per share during Q4, as we cycle the impact of refranchising the Philippines, which closed during Q1 2024. We expect the productivity benefits that I previously discussed to have a larger impact during H2 2025. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be two less days in Q1 and one additional day in Q4. So, in summary, we're successfully executing our all-weather strategy to deliver on our objectives. Our system remains incredibly focused and motivated. We will continue to invest with discipline and believe we're well positioned to drive quality top-line growth and deliver continued margin expansion.\nA hallmark of our company since its inception has been our ability to create enduring value over time, and we expect to continue to do so. With that, Operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director and senior U.S Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The business seemed to buck the trend that we've seen from many other staples companies between strong Q4 results and the conviction in upper end of the sales algorithm for 2025.\nSo I'd just be curious to hear more from you about your perspective about the consumer environment globally, particularly in developed markets where US sentiment has been so mixed. Western Europe, there have been some flags on certain markets lagging. So curious your kind of global perspective on the consumer environment. Thanks so much.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Morning, Lauren. I think the overall consumer environment is pretty stable in the sense that there's good economic growth on a broad-based view around the world, and that includes both the developed and the emerging markets. If I look at the developed markets, whilst it is absolutely true that the lower-income segments in the US.\nand perhaps more notably, in Europe and Western Europe, are under disposable income pressure and have been in 2024 and quite possibly will continue for some part of 2025. The rest of the consumer base is actually still gaining in terms of disposable income and is spending. Maybe it's spending a little more in the US, North America than Western Europe, whether there was more direction to saving, but a pretty strong, sustained demand level across the developed world. Similarly, in the emerging markets, yes, it's a little more volatile in ups and downs, but in aggregate, again, you see pretty robust or enduring consumer demand. In the quarter, we saw India rebound. We saw China get a bit better. The Middle East got a bit better. They're still doing pretty well in Latin America, a little softer, perhaps in Africa.\nBut overall, we see continued robustness and growth across consumers that we need to respond to with all the strategies that we have. It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all. We need to focus on delivering for them with the marketing, the innovation, and the execution, and particularly the affordability and premiumization. So the demand's there, and I think what you see in the fourth quarter has been added to our ability to focus on what we have to do to get a good result for the company. And that's what we're confident in continuing for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning.\nSo just on the 5% to 6% organic revenue growth forecast for 2025, can you just give us a bit more granularity on the balance between volume that you see as well as price and mix? Just wanted to focus on your plans on the pricing component in 2025. You mentioned there's some stress on the low-end consumer in a few markets after inflation in recent years, but clearly with your Q4 results, the overall consumer seems to be handling pricing from Coke well. There's also FX pressures. So there's just a number of volatile external circumstances. Just how does that impact how you manage pricing in 2025 and how that might be different than a typical year, either on the pricing or the mix front? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Morning, Dara. Look, I think let's start from the top level down on 2025.\nOur long-term algorithm, we call that we want to be at the top end, so five to six, and expect in the long term a balance between volume and price, so say two to three of each. It seems more likely in 2025 there'll be a little more price and a little less volume, but there will be volume growth, and obviously there'll be price growth, but perhaps a little weighted, a little more to price than volume than a long-term year, but still solid continued volume momentum, which has been an enduring feature of what we have pursued over the last number of years, which is not just keeping people in our franchise, but growing our franchise for the long term. And so that's the headline of what we expect to see.\nAnd I would say, if you take 2024 where you've got a kind of a headline price mix of about 10%, 1/2 of that is from these high-inflation countries, which we expected largely drop out in 2025. So another way of thinking of it is really ex-high inflation, you had about 5% price mix in 2024, and you're going to see that continue to moderate as inflation is moderated down to a kind of a slightly lower number in 2025, and largely the drop out of these high-inflation countries in 2025, if that helped give you a factor.\nAnd so we feel we've got a level of actual pricing in the marketplace that is proportionate and reasonable relative to inflation and relative to what we can support through the actions we're taking across the whole flywheel from the marketing, the innovation, the execution, the RGM, through affordability and premiumization, and all the commercial execution.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just to pick up on Dara's question, maybe John and James, can you give us just two perspectives? One is we think about the organic sales growth for 2025, just given some of the, I guess, some of the moving parts we saw in Q4. Just how should we kind of think about it from a phasing perspective?\nI guess this is the pricing from some of the emerging markets or inflationary countries kind of fade as we move through the year. So that's the first one. And the second, maybe if you could also just give us a context of 5% to 6% organic sales growth and how that stands against kind of industry growth, if you can give us some perspective on kind of what the exit rate was for the industry and maybe what you're thinking about for next year. And then just last one, I forgot to call, we should have called this out last time, but the hold music is amazing. It was a real nice change, and I just want to make sure that that gets recognized. Robin doing her job.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Brian. Well, I'm glad the last comment was not a question, so let's pass on.\nYeah, on the guidance for the year, well, we're not going to get into a lot of commentary inside the quarter. We do have two less days in the quarter. Coming out of 2024, decent momentum going into it. On the pricing front, some inflation from the more intense markets in Q1, which we expect to moderate throughout the year. And on the volume phasing itself, I think we're looking at, yeah, there's a Q2, I'd say, is probably the more challenging uphill of the quarters ahead. As I say, on the intense inflationary markets that we've highlighted in 2024, as James said, affecting the headline numbers, we see that moderating throughout the year.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nDo you want me to say, yeah, on the industry growth, if I, I mean, clearly we are planning to and expect and aim to gain share.\nSo to the extent that we end up growing five to six, then that is based on the idea that the industry is growing at a more normalized level. If you look at the long-term growth rates of the industry, you tend to get a four or a five. So we are absolutely expecting the industry growth rate to also moderate, which is kind of what was happening in Q4. The underlying rate, if you take out the high inflation countries, is kind of six or seven in the fourth quarter, and we were gaining share. So again, it's very consistent with this idea we've been talking about, which is as inflation moderates, we see a normalization of both the industry growth rate, our growth rate, with us being the long-term\nwinner in the industry with ongoing robust industry growth. Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nPlease go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you. I guess moving down the income statement, your outlook seems to imply some pretty strong underlying margin and profitability progress, just net of the FX pressures and the higher tax rate. So can you talk about some of the key drivers there? And then, I guess, similar to Brian's question, any timing considerations we should keep in mind over the course of the year beyond just the number of days in each fiscal quarter? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Maybe I'll start on the general way on some of these considerations. Firstly, yes, there is some implied margin expansion in 2025 coming from some of the market expenditure and some of the SG&A.\nThis is the culmination of many of the programs we've been putting in place over the last number of years to continue not just to get effectiveness, but to get efficiency. The simplest example is the marketing transformation where it is helping us continue. Take the Christmas ad in Q4 last year, which we made with Generative AI as a small example. It was both quicker and cheaper to make the ad. So what you're seeing come into 2025 is some of the fruition of work that's been going on across the organization, including the marketing transformation that is producing some productivity in 2025. But it is important to say that we are not backing off our bias to investment growth. This is not less marketing. This is more productive spend.\nSo our mode of operation going into the year will continue to be. We believe there will be growth in 2025 in the industry. We are going to invest from the marketing all the way down through the system into the commercial levers in order to continue to drive growth as we find pluses and minuses around the world. Of course, we will adapt and be flexible, but this is about leaning into growth, continuing to invest to drive the franchise, and being able to capture some of the benefits of the transformational work that's been going on over the number of years. John, do you want to add some considerations?\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Let me go off a little bit and talk about gross margin, Steve, so I can provide some additional commentary. We're not building an enormous amount of expansion on the gross margin front into our guidance.\nWe do expect to continue to have some underlying expansion. But as you alluded to the FX, that's to a large degree maybe offset by currency. We've anticipated for 2025 just quite a lot of moving parts inside of the gross margin equation. So as I say, we've not, for guidance purposes, built in an enormous amount of expansion. Commodities will be in the low single-digit range overall. Some pressures on the agriculturals, particularly juice, and coffee, that are a big part of our base. We have the usual set of levers that we'll deploy to cover those. But as I say, for guidance purposes, you can assume modest expansion at the gross margin line. And as James said, we've been anticipating for quite some time the 2025 environment, and the sort of the more for same, more for less mantra is certainly alive and well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector and Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you your thoughts on just the global trade environment, obviously with tariffs coming more into play here. It seems your supply chain is largely localized in most countries, but can you talk about some exposures in terms of import-export and also just the secondary impact on commodities? I know a lot of it is on your bottling system, but just thoughts on the recent tariffs also on aluminum and steel. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Filippo. Clearly, it's a dynamic macro environment out there. As commodities change for whatever reason, up or down, obviously our number one objective is to look at how we mitigate through that.\nWhether it's the reason aluminum tariffs or any other tariff-based or, frankly, weather-based or any other variation in the input commodities, we do a number of things. One, we have hedging programs in place that look to assure supply and price going out. Secondly, as the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course, we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through. Net, as John just mentioned, we are expecting more variation in agriculturals than industrials, notwithstanding recent actions. We will manage through it. As you said, we are predominantly a local business when it comes to making each of the beverages. The vast majority of everything that's consumed in the US is made in the US. Similarly, with virtually every country around the world.\nAnd so while it's a global business, it's very local. So yes, every bottler will be importing something from somewhere as a piece of the puzzle, but the economics are more predominantly local than they are global. And so it's a piece of the puzzle we need to manage through. As John said, we have that, we believe, under control from a point of view of sustaining gross margin. No doubt the environment will continue to be dynamic, but we will continue to manage, mitigate, adjust, and be agile and flexible our way through the year.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nAnd just one additional comment. Your supply chain continuity continues to be, I think, for many industries, an ongoing challenge for a variety of reasons. 2024 was no stranger to that. And our cross-enterprise procurement team are managing a vast network.\nIn addition to the economics, just making sure that we can continue to supply our markets around the world consistently is a key priority and an important advantage, I think, to enjoy as well in the many markets that we're in.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director and Senior Consumer Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning. I guess thinking about the new administration and some potential regulatory changes, what percentage of your domestic portfolio might be subject to potential changes? And then, James, how quickly can you pivot or adapt your portfolio if some of these changes are implemented? And then I'll ask it since it's become more topical again lately, but how are you thinking about potential impacts on consumption from GLP-1 drugs? Have you seen any impact?\nAnd has your thinking on this potential headwind changed in terms of your strategy, innovation, etc.? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nWell, Bonnie, I'm tempted to start with the answer to the first question by saying you win the prize for the vaguest question so far this year with what might happen subject to changes. There are many things that could happen out there in the world. And of course, we do scenario planning on regulations, on economics, on all sorts of things, and we will adapt as and when they come. More specifically on the GLP-1s. As we've commented on previous calls, we continue to see anecdotal evidence of the impact of GLP-1s on consumption of food and beverages. So far, our take is it's not a big aggregate factor for the beverage industry or the non-alcoholic beverage industry.\nthis, the volume for ourselves was up 1% in Q4 in North America. So we continue to see pretty sustained momentum in North America. There is anecdotal evidence that people consume slightly less alcohol, perhaps, and they do some switching in non-alcoholic beverages. But overall, we're seeing sustained momentum, and we are a total beverage company. So we believe whether it's GLP-1s, drugs, or changes and adaptations to regulatory ingredients, our objective is to have the biggest possible toolbox of ingredients of super high quality and safety, which we use to make a total beverage portfolio that works for consumers. And we believe we can adapt to anything that comes at us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Camille Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, everyone. Good morning.\nJohn, you laid out a long list of very substantial cash payments that have been made this year, last year, almost all of which will be behind you very soon. So can you maybe just talk about how you think about cash or capital allocation when you're on the other side of it, whether it be buybacks, whether it be more aggressive around M&A, the magnitude of the change of the amount of cash you'll have on hand next year versus this year, so substantial. I'd like to see how you might think about it differently. Thank you.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Mate. Yeah, let me maybe answer that in two parts. First of all, I don't foresee a substantial change in our focus to support the underlying business and the momentum that that has. And secondly, as we just talked about in our guidance, we will continue to support the dividends.\nSo those two areas you can assume will remain top priorities. As we get into 2026, it's a little early to anticipate exactly what 2026 will deliver for us. But as you say, clearly, the Transition tax will be in the rearview mirror, some of the M&A payments likewise. And it will give us the opportunity to take a closer look at the M&A and the share repurchase agenda. So I think it's premature to get too specific on what 2026 might bring for us. But I'm looking forward, actually, to having to deal with that challenge in the next year or so. We also have, as you are well aware, we also have a keen focus on the overall health of the balance sheet. And we'll take into account the puts and takes on that.\nWe continue to have the tax case in the next couple of years to deal with. So the name of the game for me is to have more to manage in a flexible manner some of the opportunities that may present themselves.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great.\n\nRob Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of the Global Beverages and Household Products Team, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. So Walmart has created now, I guess, what they call the modern soda shelves. And I'd love to get your thoughts on that category, broadly speaking. Is this something that is a fad in your view, or is this something that represents some kind of departure and is just very responsive to consumer needs? Is it something like fairlife, where you just have a better product?\nHow do you look to play in this so-called modern soda area that Walmart seems to at least have some confidence in? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nHi, Rob. Yeah, look, it's great news that people are innovating and willing to create new brands and dedicate more shelf space to the beverage industry, which is, I think, the goal of the whole idea. This is a vibrant industry with lots of growth. So that's the first one. Secondly, we are a total beverage company. We look to compete everywhere we see enduring consumer demand and traction, including some of the stuff that goes here. Look, in the end, these are soda beverages that are great tasting. That's the central idea. And I think to the extent that's enduring, we'll take a really hard look at it.\nBut I think the most important thing to take from this is the confidence in the overall industry of beverages to continue to grow. And as John alluded to, and we'll talk more at CAGNI, when you look at the track record of the Coca-Cola Company in terms of creating organically and scaling small bolt-on M&A into billion-dollar brands, we are by far and away the clear leaders in the industry and the winners.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nHead of Consumer Staples Research and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, everyone. James, you mentioned agricultural commodities. You also, I think, said something to the effect of industrial commodities are perhaps moving a bit less, but you're watching developments. I'm assuming you're speaking to aluminum. Can you just maybe provide some context, number one, on how incremental moves in aluminum might impact your cost-per-case outlook, number one?\nAnd just related, there's this element of the system will need to respond to incremental inflation from aluminum. Can you just talk about comfort that affordability and volume durability will not be impacted if the system needs to respond to climbing inflation? So it's a little bit of a two-part question in the impact to the model, but also a bit forward-looking in what may be required to protect the model and the impact on the consumer in the coming months. Thanks so much.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. I mean, firstly, this is predominantly an impact in the North American or in the US business, let's say the North American business, which is obviously a piece of the puzzle. So from a total company perspective, bear in mind this is over just one of the four segments, largely speaking, as we sit here today.\nAnd of course, as it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space. So for example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET bottles, etc., etc. So we will adapt the packaging strategy in function of changes in the relative input costs of what goes into that. So that is part of the total adaptation plan that we use around the world. Secondly, so I don't believe if part of the question in the second half is, do you think this is going to fundamentally undermine the ability of the system to do well in volume in 2025? The short answer is no.\nI think we control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening because it's a combination of hedging, which we use on the key materials. It's an opportunity to do mixed management between different packaging materials. And of course, we're going to look at where the supply is from because it's all about relative pricing. To the extent relative pricing changes, we can seek to adapt. And so I think this is mitigatable and manageable and one of the dynamic elements of 2025 that I think we can get through.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, Operator. And hi, James, John. I have a question on Mexico and then a follow-up on mix.\nOn Mexico, you have obviously managed cycles, regulation, tax as well, and arguably you count on one of the best bottling partners there. But can you comment on the playbook and if you're embedding acceleration in volumes there? And can you talk about the potential risk of recession, or would remittances at a stronger dollar, meaning obviously more pesos to their pockets, partially offsetting this slowdown? And then on the second point, you both spent a fair amount of time discussing the accelerating innovation results, which are remarkable. On the strong delivery in North America, I believe you posted like 12% growth in price mix. How much is that driven by fairlife or away-from-home recovery? And should we expect those comparisons to lead to acceleration there, or you still see a lot of potential for fairlife distribution and potentially better execution on on-premise ahead? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company",
    "content2": "Wow. Okay.\nThat's a lot of questions in there. Let me try and pack it into two. North American pricing: about half of the North American pricing that you see in Q4 is mix. Therefore, you can basically kind of park that relative to 2025. So it's not just Fairlife. But if you just take half of that and call that price mix, that is going to continue to moderate as you go into 2025 in the North American sense. The mix will also moderate in 2025. We'll continue to grow Fairlife in 2025. But given the runaway success of the products, we are reaching the need to get the New York factory that we've been building up and running in order to continue unconstrained growth. So we will see some moderation of the Fairlife growth in '25, which will obviously then moderate the mix.\nSo much more normalization of US price mix in 2025. And then Mexico, I mean, unpacking the Mexican playbook is a longer conversation, but I think is a place where par excellence, we have had a dedicated and consistent execution of the overall playbook, whether it's great quality marketing, great quality innovation, great quality execution, great quality RGM, so pricing options. I mean, the one place you can go and find a package at almost every price point is Mexico. It's one of the broadest beverage portfolios in the world in terms of covering off all the categories. So it's been a long-term dedication by the system in Mexico to build the total beverage company with a product and a package and a price point for everyone everywhere. And of course, we commented just on the peso.\nWe did call out FX headwinds in 2025, but they had taken on a different nature. We're not expecting large impacts to come from the intense inflation countries. We're expecting those headwinds to come from some of the more normal, let's say, emerging markets like Mexico. And that's part of the headwind you see on the peso conversion to the US dollar for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. So James, I was hoping to follow up on your response to Dara's question. And I apologize if I misheard this, but I think you mentioned organic growth would be a bit more weighted to price relative to volume, which isn't entirely surprising.\nNot to get too granular, but I wasn't sure if you were implying that you were expecting volume growth to kind of fall short of the 2% to 3% growth we typically see or just at the lower end of that range. I just asked that in the context of 2% unit case volume growth exiting the year. You touched on a lot of these more challenged markets getting better in the quarter. It would seem that you have some pretty nice momentum exiting the year, and for Q1, exit rate would be a good place to start. But I'm not sure if there's maybe some offsets or areas of concern that we might not be thinking about. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, Peter, yeah, I think you got what I said to Dara correctly. Yeah.\nI mean, if you just take 2024, we did 2% in the fourth quarter. We did 1% overall for the year. So yeah, I mean, what I was saying is implying we're at the 1, 2, kind of floating around that sort of range with a compensating factor on the pricing side. So we still get up into the 5 to 6 range. So I think you got it clearly. And I think also, I think John made a comment earlier in terms of the timing during the year that Q2 is clearly going to be a tougher cycling quarter. But overall for the year, we feel we're coming in with momentum. There are a decent number of unknowns and a dynamic environment in 2025 we believe we can manage through.\nFrom a volume perspective, I'd like to think it's going to be a little better than 2024 overall, but it's in that sort of ballpark.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nEquity Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nSure. Yeah. Hi, James, John. Hope you're both well. I've got a question on India, please, which had a good 2024, and more broadly, it's been a great market for you over the past few years. I saw in Q4 that you've refranchised 40% to a local partner. And I was just wondering if you could comment on that and what attributes that local partner brings that perhaps could even accelerate the Indian business to the next level.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you. Thanks, Charlie. I just came back from a trip to India, so maybe I'll take this one.\nThe refranchising program that we've had in place continues to move ahead. India is no different to other parts of the world. We look for a certain profile of partner, those who are ambitious as we are to capture the opportunity, who have the capital, who have the ability to build capability over time. We believe that our new partner there ticks the box very handsomely on all of these attributes. You can just think of it as another chapter in the refranchising program, not just for India, but for those remaining in our portfolio. The Indian market has got a tremendous amount of runway ahead. The environment there is pretty vibrant, tremendous competitive set. We believe that the Jubilant Group coming in is going to add tremendously to our abilities to continue to step change our execution in the marketplace.\nAs we continue to work on the refranchising program, we'll advise in the coming months and into next year as to how that shapes out.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. Good morning. I just want to follow up on kind of the commentary on the hyperinflationary environment and your kind of comment of it moderating. And I understand it moderating, but I believe a lot of the pricing you took was kind of more of the second half, so that will carry through. I don't think these countries have really slowed down in their inflationary environment. So are you saying that you're kind of done with pricing there or that you would be taking price cuts?\nBecause it seems like I understand you have a general guidance for this year, but it seems like the hyperinflation environments, there's not a real reason for them to moderate, but so much, at least for the next couple of quarters.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nBill, yeah, though absolutely not taking the foot off the pedal in terms of passing through where we have a lot of input costs coming in. So it's not that we are not going to be passing through the input costs in those marketplaces. It was very concentrated, these high inflationary countries, and there has been inflationary moderation. I mean, if you look at Argentina for the sake of a single-year example, the monthly inflation rate has dropped markedly through 2024. I think it's down to a few percent a month now or 4% a month. So you definitely see a moderation.\nYes, you're right that in a sense, you'll see more of it in the first half and the first quarters than you will in the back end of the year. But inflation has definitively dropped in a lot of these countries because it was very concentrated in a handful, Argentina, a couple of the African countries, and Türkiye. And so the inflation has come down. But we will continue. If it doesn't moderate, if there's other countries that fall into this category, because its input costs go up, we will pass those through in price. Even though we look to execute all our affordability strategies, we have to pass through the costs in those sorts of environments because it's just too overwhelming.\n\nOperator\n\nQuestion comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Food & Beverages Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thanks.\nI wanted to maybe push a little bit more on your commentary that you can change your mix of packaging to react to aluminum tariffs or higher aluminum costs. Is there any way to kind of delineate this? How much of a mix shift is necessary to go more toward plastic, less toward aluminum cans in the event of a sharp increase in can cost? It may not be a fair question, but is a 1% change in mix big enough to really influence the cost structure, or does it have to be something much bigger than that?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nLook, I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system. It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multi-billion-dollar US business. And packaging is a small component of the total cost structure.\nSo firstly, it's not a multi-billion dollar problem relative to the input cost. It's a much more manageable number. And so between mitigation of supply chain, sourcing, weights of the cans, price increase of the cans at some level, potentially switch to the PT, it's a manageable problem in the context of the total US business. And I don't think you should not conclude that this is some huge swing factor in the US business. It's a cost. It'll have to be managed. It would be better not to have it relative to the US business, but we are going to manage our way through.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just wanted to unpack Asia Pacific a little bit more. You had price mix down there, partially offset by some pricing.\nBut in the full-year market share commentary, which I know is a little bit apples and oranges, South Korea and Japan grew or gained share, and then Indonesia and Bangladesh declined or lost share. That would seem like a positive for mix. So maybe how do you reconcile those? What are some of the moving parts, and just help us understand that a little bit better?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. I think the biggest factor here in Asia Pacific in Q4 is what we're cycling from last year. So I would encourage you as you look at Asia; it's true overall, but Asia Pacific in particular, for the reasons you call out, you've got some very developed markets like Japan, and Australia, and some very emerging markets like Bangladesh, and Indonesia. And their relative volume performances can make a big difference to mix. So what you're seeing is a base effect from 2023 coming over.\nBut I would encourage any analysis of price mix in Asia-Pacific to be multi-quarter because it's just very choppy for the very reasons you just called out.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thanks very much, everyone. To summarize, we're winning in the marketplace. We're going to continue to maintain our agility and focus on getting better on everything we do. We believe we're well-positioned to deliver on our 2025 guidance and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. We look forward to discussing more next week at CAGNI. Thanks for your interest, the investment in our company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you very much, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (The Coca-Cola Company)\n\nCompany Representative 3, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nHello, world. Where you been?

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question and answer portion of the call.\nI would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed.

Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our Company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins.\nThis call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the Company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Re-enter the queue to ask follow-ups now.\nI will turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks Robin and good morning everyone. After a good start of the year, we continued our momentum in the Q2. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, our all weather strategy is working. We're winning in the marketplace by leveraging our scale and continuing to foster a growth mindset. Given our strong year to date results, we are raising both our top line and our bottom line guidance today.\nThis morning I'll start by discussing the current operating environment and reviewing our Q2 performance. Then I'll explain how we're enhancing our capabilities to drive more effective and efficient operations, including leveraging digital and tech-enabled innovations to ultimately contribute to our earnings growth. Finally, John will discuss our financial results in a raised 2024 guidance.\nIn the Q2 we grew volume, generated strong organic revenue growth, and expanded margins. While continuing to invest in our business, we also gained value share. This culminated in 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. Overall, our industry remains attractive and is expanding. We believe we're well positioned to capture the vast opportunities available to us across the world. We're continuing to navigate many varying market dynamics locally to deliver our global objectives.\nIn Asia Pacific, we had strong performance across most of our footprints in ASEAN and South Pacific. The refranchising of the Philippines is off to a good start. In the Philippines we grew volume by double digits and drove strong value share gains by increasing focus on affordable packages including accessible price points and refillable offerings.\nGrowth across ASEAN and South Pacific was driven by strong end-to-end execution across our sparkling portfolio.\nOur business in India recovered nicely from a slower start to the year driven by Sprite and Fanta as well as strong local brands such as Thums Up and Maaza. Strong end-to-end execution across our growth flywheel led to double-digit volume growth.\nIn China, consumer confidence remains subdued. We continue to focus on our core business and invest behind profitable long-term growth.\nLastly, in Japan and South Korea, we generated volume growth during the quarter and won value share. We successfully relaunched Ayataka, a much-loved local tea brand in Japan, and we're also benefiting from stronger execution in e-commerce channels.\nIn EMEA, the external environment remains mixed. In Europe, we saw pressure in our away from home business due to some reduced foot traffic and adverse weather in Western Europe. To capture value, we're investing in several highly anticipated activations including music festivals, the Euro 2024 Football Championship, and of course the Paris Olympics. We're increasing our focus on brands with strong momentum across our total beverage portfolio, including Fuze Tea, Powerade, and on promising sparkling innovations such as Coke Lemon, and reformulated Sprite.\nIn Eurasia and Middle East, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty continue to impact our business. We're working closely with our local partners to navigate these headwinds while investing for the longer term. In Africa, despite multiple currency devaluations, strong integrated execution led to robust performance across our markets. For example, in Nigeria, our system quickly responded to the intense inflationary environment by focusing on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings, and increasing outlet coverage to win both volume and value share.\nAcross Africa, we grew volume in mid single digits and similarly won both volume and value share. In North America, we generated robust top line and bottom line growth and won value share. Our volume decline was driven by softness in away from home channels. To offset this, we're partnering with foodservice customers to market food and drink combo meals to drive traffic and beverage incidence.\nExcluding mainstream packaged water, at home volumes held up well. Fairlife and Trademark Coke finished number one and number two as the at home retail sales growth leaders for the industry during the quarter. Our juice business also had a strong quarter, and recent innovations including Sprite Chill and Topo Chico Sabores are off to solid starts. In Latin America, volume momentum continued led by strength.\nIn Mexico and Brazil, growth was driven across our entire total beverage portfolio. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar had a standout quarter with over 20% volume growth, and we're continuing to take integrated execution to the next level by increasing investments behind cold drink equipment to win share of visible inventory and create additional consumer demand.\nFinally, in global ventures, despite pressures in key markets such as the United Kingdom and China, we generated organic revenue growth and expanded margins. Costa is driving loyalty through targeted promotions like Treat Drop, and Innocent gains value share in Europe. Putting it all together, Costa, despite an ever-changing external environment, our business remains very resilient. The power of our portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities, is a clear advantage.\nWhile we're delivering on our near term commitments, we're also building capabilities and innovating across our flywheel to become a more agile, effective, and efficient organization. Starting with Marketing and Innovation. Last year, we stood up Studio X, which is our digital and organizational ecosystem that integrates marketing capabilities and connects them to our global network structure. We're producing tailored content at scale, and with speed, and are able to measure impact in real time.\nWe're also refining our innovation process to prioritize bigger and bolder bets, and we're removing barriers to deliver a more holistic approach. Shorten the time to launch and improve success rates.\nWe know that innovations that grow in the second year have a much greater odds for multi-year success and deliver far greater impact. We focused on sustaining investment and have consistently improved second year performance success rates in each of the past four years.\nContinued innovation successes include Sprite and Fanta reformulations, Fuze Tea in Europe, and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in North America, among many others.\nAs a result of these combined initiatives, we have greatly improved our ability to rapidly produce and deliver marketing content, integrate activations with timely innovations, and scale successes to drive the greatest impact. One example from the Q2, Coca-Cola's partnership with Marvel, which featured nearly 40 different limited edition collectible graphics and QR codes on our packaging to connect consumers with unique augmented reality experiences. We collaborated closely with Marvel Studios and The Walt Disney Company and tapped into the best in class animation and activation to quickly scale to over 50 markets.\nAs a result of this and other growth initiatives, Trademark Coca-Cola grew volume and won volume and value share during the quarter.\nOur marketing and innovation transformation journey contributed to Coca-Cola winning Creative Brand of the Year for the first time ever at the Cannes Lions in June. We won 18 different awards at Cannes Lions.\nBeyond marketing innovation, we're flexing our muscle in revenue growth management and integrated execution to sustain competitive advantage. Even in markets with very well developed capabilities, there's potential to be even better. For example, Mexico is one of the markets at the forefront of revenue growth management and has the highest cold drink equipment density in the world. During the quarter, we drove affordability with refillables and premiumization with single serve transactions. Our system also added over 80,000 coolers year-to-date.\nThrough these and similar initiatives, we grew volume mid single digits during the quarter, continuing the momentum for the past few quarters. Each day, consumers enjoy approximately 2.2 billion servings of our products, translating into about 800 billion servings annually. This kind of scale gives us unique insights into the consumer which helps us to better tailor offerings.\nEmerging technologies, including those enhanced by AI, have the potential to create value for retailers and consumers. For example, we're piloting an AI-based price-packed channel optimization tool across several markets that evaluates opportunities to better tailor solutions to drive incremental volume and revenue. Early results show that the tool helps improve both our offerings and speed to market. Our system is also piloting an AI-driven initiative to push personalized messages to retailers with suggested items based on previous orders and market data.\nInitial pilots indicate that retailers who receive the messages are over 30% more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, which results in incremental sales for our retailers and the system. We're just scratching the surface of what's possible and we're taking steps to seize opportunities down the road.\nTo sum it all up, while we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available, we're encouraged by our year-to-date results and efforts to improve every aspect of how we do business. As we look forward to the second half of the year, the external backdrop remains uncertain, including some signs of pressure in various consumer segments across developed markets. However, thanks to the power of our portfolio and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we are confident we will deliver on our updated 2024 guidance and longer-term commitments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In Q2 we delivered strong results. We grew organic revenues 15%. This consisted of 2% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were ahead of volume by four points, driven primarily by timing of concentrate shipments and some disruptions in the global supply chain that we partly expect to reverse next quarter.\nOur Price Mix growth of 9% in the quarter was primarily driven by two items: one, approximately five points of intense inflationary pricing across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation, and two, an array of Pricing and Mix actions across our markets.\nExcluding the impacts from concentrate shipment timing and pricing from markets with intense inflation. Organic revenue growth during the quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 200 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and the benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 120 basis points.\nComparable operating margin expansion was less than comparable gross margin expansion due to less benefit from bottler refranchising and greater currency headwinds to comparable operating margin, putting it all together. Q2 comparable EPS of $0.84 was up 7% year over year despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising.\nFree cash flow was approximately $3.3 billion, down approximately $700 million versus the prior year. Due to higher tax payments, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year, and higher capital expenditures.\nWe continue to take actions to achieve a fit for purpose balance sheet that will best support our growth agenda. During the quarter we raised approximately $4 billion in cash by issuing long-term debt for general corporate purposes. This may include pre-funding upcoming payments related to the IRS tax case and the Fairlife contingent consideration with respect to our IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend. We're making progress toward next steps and we expect we will be able to move forward on appeal by the end of the year.\nGiven the continued outperformance of Fairlife, we recorded a charge of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Our estimated final payment related to this acquisition is $5.3 billion, which will be made in 2025. We are encouraged by Fairlife's performance and the value it has created for our company.\nSo far this year we've realized nearly $3 billion in gross proceeds from bottler refranchising and streamlining our equity investments. We'll continue to prioritize higher growth businesses and take passive capital off the table. Return on invested capital is 24%, up approximately five points from three years ago.\nOur balance sheet is strong as demonstrated by our net debt leverage of 1.5x EBITDA, which is well below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5.\nWe have ample capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda which prioritizes investing to drive further growth, continuing to support our dividend, and staying dynamic, agile, and opportunistic.\nAs James mentioned, we're proactively managing our portfolio to deliver on our commitments. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the momentum of our business in the first half of the year and our confidence in our ability to execute on our plans during the second half of this year.\nWe now expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10 and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 15.\nBottler refranchising is still expected to be a four to five point headwind to comparable net revenues, and we now expect a one to two point headwind to comparable earnings per share.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate five to six point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate eight to nine point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024.\nThis increase in currency headwind is driven by a small number of intense inflationary markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results.\nAll in. We now expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6 versus $2.69 in 2023.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind. We expect unit cases and concentrate shipments to be relatively in line with each other for the full year 2024. Please keep in mind there are two extra days in Q4.\nTaking everything into consideration, we expect earnings growth during the remainder of 2024 will be weighted towards Q4.\nTo summarize, we're encouraged by our track record and the underlying momentum of our business. Our system remains incredibly focused and motivated to drive growth. We're continuing to drive quality top line growth, expand margins, grow comparable earnings per share, and improve the return profile our business. We're confident we will deliver on our guidance and longer term objectives.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press star1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. It'd be helpful to get an update on North America given questions around consumer spending, to just discuss any demand impact you're seeing on your business, any variance in channel performance, and how that informs your view going forward. And then also as we transition to a more normalized cost environment, can you give us any perspective on what's a more sustained Price Mix run rate going forward in North America? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. No problem, though.\nFirstly, overall, it'd be fair to say that the consumer sentiment in aggregate is actually pretty strong, pretty resilient. Within that, there are some softer spots, particularly I think, which has been relatively put out there already. Some softness in away from home channels with a little lower traffic and certain increase in value seeking for combo meals. So definitely there's a piece of the lower income consumers which are either going out slightly less or when they do go somewhere looking for greater value through combo meals.\nAnd then of course in the at home channels there's a slightly greater focus by those consumers on getting kind of value deals or promo deals. Having said that, there are just as much consumers spending on more premium categories or more premium price points and experiences. So that's all aggregating out at a sort of resilience for the average overall consumer.\nWithin that, I think we've done very well. We've seen strong growth across the portfolio. We saw strong growth in Coke Trademark, in Fairlife, in Topo Chico, and Juice and so, and in aggregate, we won value share in the quarter. So broad-based growth, some hotspots in terms of demand up, demand down, but overall resilience to the consumer. And as you look out, the first thing that I think is worth underlining in North America in particular is the nature of the Price Mix.\nRemember that our North American business, atypically compared to the other parts of the world, we consolidate a set of vertically integrated businesses and a set of franchise concentrate businesses such that the growth of a channel or a category can produce a Mix effect independent of pricing in the marketplace.\nAs you look at the 11 points of Price Mix in the Q2 in North America, it's important to understand that only half of that is actually Price, the other half is Mix. So when the Juice Drinks, Fairlife, and the Juice business grows, Topo Chico grows and Dasani is weaker, you get a mechanical business mix effect that makes the Price Mix look like it's gone up, but it hasn't really in the marketplace. So think of it as half of it is business mix and half of it is real pricing in the marketplace. Which gets you to a much more logical match to the level of inflation that's.\nGoing on in the marketplace in general. Such that I think in North America and actually overall in general around the world, excluding the high, the intense inflation markets John mentioned in the comments, we see that inflation is largely coming into the landing zone.\nYes, central banks would like to squeeze out another point or so, but generally we're getting there, and I think that's reflected in our Price Mix. We still have input costs that are going up, typically the agricultural ones rather than the metal or commodity based ones. But in the end our strategy remains. Yes, there'll be cost inflation. Yes, we'll look to put it through. Yes, we'll work on productivity. But any pricing we're going to take we're going to have to earn with the marketing in the innovation, and the execution. But it is, as I said earlier, approaching the normalization zone.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks so much. I'd love to have a similar conversation about Western Europe because James, you mentioned a bit on some also slowness in away from home. But the summer of sports kind of has already kicked off. June was certainly part of it, and so I know the weather has been challenging, but maybe a little surprising to see the softness in the unit case volume in EMEA. So I'd love some just a similar run through as you just did on North America on some of the dynamics particular to Western Europe. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYes, sure. So let me first just separate Europe from EMEA, which obviously includes the Middle East and Africa.\nAfrica had a strong Q2 volume, good volume growth building on good volume growth in the Q1, Price Mix. Obviously, there's a lot of swings and roundabouts macroeconomically going on in Africa, but actually, net-net, the Africa business had really good quarter winning volume and value share, managing through the inflation and growth on good volume growth and good price growth. The flip side is Middle East. Obviously, the conflict is continuing to affect the business in that part of the world.\nSo, there's some headwinds there. Then if you come to Europe within EMEA, Europe was overall not where we'd like it to be. We'd like to see a little more growth coming out of the European business. Really, it's a complete Mix across the countries in Europe. There's more pressure on the away from home in the West than the East.\nYes, some of the sporting programs have certainly helped, whether it was UEFA, that's already happened, or Olympics, which is imminently going to start.\nThe sporting has helped, but there's been some pressure on the away from home, as I said in the West. So the immediate consumption packs have been growing slower there, but the strong programs but not yet enough to offset the weather in some of the countries, and the same general effect as the US in terms of the lower income consumers seeking a value and doing less away from home trips. So big picture, Europe not too dissimilar from the US. Perhaps a little worse weather and a little more sporting events, but in an aggregate sense very similar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. John, just a question for you. Two points maybe related to the concentrate shipments. One is I know you've talked about expecting that they'll line up by the end of the year, but I guess can you talk a little bit about what's driving this? How much of it is the Red Sea and I don't know, just it's maybe more difficult to get stuff around versus just kind of the regular timing differences. And I guess what's underneath this is should we expect a little bit more volatility in the near term just around shipments versus units versus just simply because the world's a little bit unsettled right now.\nAnd the second, if you can just give us a perspective on how much margin, gross margin benefited from.\nThe excess shipments in the quarter. Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOkay, thanks, Bryan. So on the first question, yes, we had a number of events during Q1 that affected the relationship between unit cases and concentrate. You mentioned a couple of them, the congestion in the Red Sea and Singapore. In LATAM we had some restocking in the wake of the floods in Brazil, and in our India operations we had some stocking up to anticipate some future demand. So a range of factors, none of them with a common thread to them. Our guidance assumes a more normal second half of the year. But as you rightly highlighted, there is likely to be something ahead of us that we have not anticipated. And if that were to happen.\nWe certainly advise. But our goal is over the longer haul, is to continue to have cases and gallons in line.\nWith regards to the gross margin impact. There's a slight benefit on both the growth in operating margins related to stocking, but it's in the tens of basis points and again reflected in our guidance years ago with that, with that leveling out that we expect.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning everyone. I did want to ask a little bit more about your away from home business, James, which you did touch on, I guess. I was hoping to hear how much your business in this channel decelerated in Q2 versus Q1 and what your outlook is for the remainder of the year. And then assuming growth in the channel moderates further, you know, how do we think about the impact this may have on your top line, and margins, and maybe just touch on any initiatives you've implemented to accelerate growth in this channel moving forward. I think that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Bonnie. I don't think it would be.\nI don't think it'd be worth saying there's a big deceleration going on as we come into the Q2 from the Q1. If you just stand back a bit and look at what happened, and I think we were already calling out some softness in away-from-home in the back end of last year. So I would characterize it more as there's been a slow build from the back half of last year through the first and the Q2.\nFirst and Q2, maybe a little more negative than the back half last year, but really it's been a kind of a slow softening rather than anything major and abrupt. It's not, you know, like accelerating off a cliff.\nIt's kind of a slow softening that's kind of just running at a softest level when thinking about away from home in the US, and then in terms of what we're doing about it, which is obviously the key question, is we've really been more focused on how can we make sure that we bring to bear in the away from home channels, in a sense, all the thinking that we have historically done on affordability and price pack architecture in some of the mom and pop and at home channels to make sure, working with our partners across the different channels, that we can provide, whether it's the meal combos or whatever format of offering.\nSo that there's a laddering of pricing to allow people to stay within the category and the channel. And so those are rolling out as we speak.\nWe expect to see them making an impact.\nIn the year to go.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analysts, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you, and good morning. Maybe John, just to maybe put a wrap around.\nThe margin driver conversation and the impact of Mix and concentrate timing, etc. Year to date, the underlying margin performance both in the quarter and year to date I guess has been strong as I'm penciling it out. Right. It doesn't feel like you're expecting a material difference in the underlying margin performance of the business in the back half despite.\nThe slower concentrate sales and some of the macro drivers, want to play that back and confirm that. If there are any material differences, maybe you just help us as to what are the drivers.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure, Steve, thanks. So on gross margin, just to maybe highlight the big drivers, typically are underlying performance, any structural changes we have in the quarter.\nMost of which nowadays relates to our refranchising activity and then any currency impact. So year-to-date we're reflecting almost 200 basis points.\nThe increase, and that's primarily driven by structural and underlying, with some offset on currency. For the second half of the year, typically the margin profile in the second half of the year is.\nSlightly lower than the first half. But.\nI would say the overall trends in the second half of the year will be similar to what we've seen in the first half.\nMaybe just to step it down to the operating margin line, not dissimilar.\nWe have had.\nMore benefit on the underlying margin in the first half of the year than on structural, and then second half of the year I expect it to be more even. And yet, as we've discussed in prior calls, we sort of reserve the right to stay flexible.\nIn the event that we make investment decisions that link to what's happening in our many markets around the world. But overall direction of travel on both the growth and operating line is our margin profile to be strengthening and to be pretty much in line with some of the previous conversations we've had on this topic.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analysts, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the Latin America business. It continues to be a very strong driver of your total company growth with very strong unit case volume, still very strong Price Mix. There was obviously some temporary impact with the flooding in Brazil, but just curious, what is working? Well, I know your bottler relationship have improved significantly over the last couple of years and also just a general sense of how the consumer is behaving in.\nYour key market, Brazil, Mexico, and some of the other countries. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nYeah.\nLatin America had another strong result in the quarter. Sustained volume momentum as you mentioned, clearly being driven by Mexico and Brazil. It's a pretty broad-based category success story, including not just Coke Trademark but now Coke Zero at 20% volume growth.\nObviously part of this is a long term capability momentum building approach with our bottlers in Latin America. Really bringing together all of the components of the strategy that we talk about, whether it be the marketing transformation, the focus on innovation, the execution of price packaging in the marketplace, particularly in markets like Latin America, making sure we both have premiumization and opportunities, but also critically important affordability options, whether that be with.\nRegular packaging or returnable packaging, but really making sure we have ways of keeping people in the franchise and all executed by the bottling system, which has really doubled down not just on traditional execution and putting more cold doors out there, but the digitization of their relationships with the retailers. So really a representation of what is possible when all the elements of the strategy of the system are executed in the marketplace. I think it's worth noting that obviously yes, strong volume performance at 5%.\nPlease do bear in mind that the Price Mix is heavily affected by the Argentinian high inflation, and 2/3 of the Price Mix is actually due to Argentina. So that leaves you about roughly 6% for normal in-market consumer pricing for the rest of the countries. Nevertheless, a very strong result in Latin America.\nVery pleasing, and looking forward to seeing that continue into the future.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on just balance sheet cash flow specifically around Fairlife. Clearly it's a positive development that Fairlife continues to do so well. The liability does, however, continue to grow. John, can you just maybe comment on what you can do to perhaps limit the negative impact from raising additional capital to cover Fairlife, to cover the escrow payment, and specifically from a cash flow perspective in the next 12 to 18 months and perhaps just an overall view on how you see net interest expense versus income trending as you have some of these major payments ahead. Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure, Chris. Thank you. Well, firstly, as I said, we're very pleased with the performance of Fairlife and the end is in sight relative to the overall.\nContext of the deal we have in place there with regard to the broader free cash flow conversation.\nThe sources we have are cash from operations.\nIn the short term, as we continue to refranchise some of our businesses from the proceeds that come in from that. During Q2, we also went into the debt market, and we issued some long-term debt. So it's really a combination of those three that we are managing very, very closely to.\nDeal with the end of this year and into 2025 on the outflows that we see.\nBalance sheet remains strong. We go into 2025 with a clear line of sight as to what needs to be taken care of.\nAnd yet, as we have discussed on many occasions, relative to our overall capital allocation strategy, we will continue to invest in the business as appropriate to support the dividend file. We take care of the Fairlife acquisition and the tax payment that is on the horizon relative to the IRS tax cut. So all in all.\nIt's going to be an interesting 18 months to work through. But we feel very confident that the work we've done today prepares us well to manage through it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. So James, on the Price Mix in North America, you mentioned about half of the 11 points driven by Mix and the other pretty much pricing, but still quite driven by innovation. Can you talk about the cadence of what to expect, going, moving ahead? Of course, you've done amazingly well, the team there, in terms of the marketing campaigns and marketing and around packaging and all of that RGM playbook that you have.\nBut looking ahead, is that any additional gains you expect and how we should be thinking, I guess broadly even not only in North America, but also in Brazil and Mexico, how to think of additional gains in there and as well as in EMEA. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. I mean.\nAbsolutely. We're going to continue to press ahead with the marketing, with the innovation, with the price back, and with the execution. That's the way we earn the right to take a reasonable level of pricing. Clearly some of the inflationary effects and some of the Mix effects are likely to.\nBecome more subdued as we go into the back half of the years. So I'm not expecting, for example, in North America, if half of it is from Mix and half of it is from core pricing, I think the Mix piece will start to trend down over time. And in part it does so because it starts cycling itself.\nAnd so I think the key for me is to look through the kind of the Mix and the inflation effects and think about core pricing. And if you do that at an overall company level and look at Q2 in its totality, again, as I said, a big piece of it was inflation. You take it out and you're at the 4-ish% in core pricing or 2% volume, there you are right in the sweet spot of the top end of the algorithm that we've been looking to deliver on. So I think that the central assumption is a landing zone.\nFor these effects, like inflation and Mix, and starting to see more of the Price Mix being the core actions across the strategy flywheels driving the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHe delivered 2% case volume growth and you know, when we look across sort of the rest of staples, we're seeing.\nQuite a bit of slowdown in volumes. I think you're positive everywhere, with the exception maybe of North America.\nCan you maybe just talk a bit more, as you're, you know, you provided your operating environment views, but also AI innovation, new sports, sporting events, these types of things? What should we be looking at over the medium term in terms of volume growth?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. So we, as from a strategy perspective, have taken the approach over the last number of years, not to say even longer, that it's critically important, particularly when times get tougher, to try and keep as many consumers in the franchise as possible rather than trying to re-recruit them at some later stage. And therein, our focus not just on marketing innovation, but affordability within the price pack architecture. So clearly an objective of ours is not to see negative volumes and to make sure we keep people in and use all the elements to do that.\nAnd so, as you say, we got 2% in the quarter. We've had a run rate there. We've talked in the past, and it remains true today that the central long-term growth algorithm, we're looking for revenue of 4% to 6, and we've set ourselves the ambition of staying in the 5% to 6 range with a balance of volume and Price Mix. So that's essentially a way of, if you've split that, you're saying 2% to 3 in volume and 2% to 3 in price.\nWe were kind of in that range in the quarter with the 2% volume. So I think in the long run we'll continue to pursue that talked earlier this year that in the shorter term it's likely to be slightly more price and slightly less volume, which was kind of exactly what happened in the Q2. So it would not surprise me as we go through the rest of the year that that remains true, that we see slightly less volume than the kind of standard algorithm and slightly more prices as pricing tends towards inflation, tends towards the landing zone. And I think that's likely to be true as we go into the, as we go through the rest of the summer.\nHopefully the weather gets a bit better, but we're likely to see that slightly less volume, slightly more price, and probably a repetition of where that volume is coming from in terms of the rest of the year. The positives largely being the developing economies, Latin America, India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and to some extent Japan. And the kind of weighing on it a little.\nParts of North America and Europe, channel- and income-specific, and some of the disruptions from the Middle East. But net-net we think we've got a strong strategy that's playing out and is winning, and we're confident that we can drive that to get a balanced algorithm of growth through the rest of this year, for our guidance and into the future.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you very much. I'd like to go back to North America, but look at it more on a category basis for the first half of the year, with more emphasis on maybe the Q2, and get your thoughts on a couple of things. Number one, it looks like for the first time that I can think of sparkling is doing better than energy as a sector. Love to get your thoughts on maybe what the drivers are there. Second, sports strengths, how your new strategy is working. You know, combining Powerade and BodyArmor under one management team. And then third, any other particular things that you're seeing on the category side that are worth noting? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure.\nDefinitely North America had a good Q2. The standouts in terms of growth, clearly. Actually, what's interesting is actually if you look at the Nielsen universe and you look at which two trademarks provided most dollar retail growth in Q2, and the answer is Fairlife and Coca-Cola. And so in a way, you could see that as a sort of microcosm for the overall strategy working. You've got both ends of the portfolio working, and it's being executed in the marketplace and driving really substantial growth. So good performance.\nBy Fairlife, good performance overall by Coca-Cola. With growth obviously being led by, by Coca-Cola Zero in the sports category getting better. We had some positive volume growth in BodyArmor and Powerade, and we're really starting to see the kind of stabilization with the marketing and the innovation and some pack price work going on there. We're not yet gaining all the share we want to gain, but we've stabilized and starting to turn the corner with some of those innovations on Zero and Flash I.V. and Powerade Sour. So a good kind of step forward and turning the corner and clearly looking to do better. I'm not sure there's much more to say.\nGreat quarter, and long may it last.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning. So I guess I just wanted to follow up on Robert's question, just specifically, you know, on energy drinks. Right. I mean, it's one of the few categories where we've seen a pretty notable change here. So do you have any perspective, James, on what may be driving the weaker performance? And then as you look ahead, would you anticipate maybe some of this pressure to be short-lived? Is there something you're seeing that would suggest this weakness could persist through the balance of the year and into maybe 2025? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Well, I think you need to kind of.\nBreak it up a bit. I mean, firstly, look, we've had a great partnership with Monster, created tremendous value for Monster, for us, Coca-Cola, and for the bottling partners. Clearly, in the case of the US, there's been what happens in every category when people create a category and there's one or two brands is people look for the white spaces and start to innovate and start to bring new news to the category. I think that's what's happening in Energy, particularly in the US, and so I think working with Monster, that will respond to the evolution of the way the consumer is looking at the category.\nI think it's also important to understand that the Energy category is one of the categories that respond to an overall consumer need state of being fueled for their lives.\nAnd so from a company point of view, we see that as something where we bring multiple brands to bear against that need state. And each brand in each category needs to play its part in kind of delivering on that. And each one has to do their own work to do it. But I think there's more to be done across the board, including in the Monster Energy portfolio, and we're working with them on that. And then I think internationally there's robust growth in the Energy category and making good progress around the world in different ways in different forms.\nSo I think one has to kind of pull apart energy category and look at it kind of geographically to see that overall it's still got some good growth and there's different jobs to be done in different parts of the world.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nDirector, Redburn\n\nYeah, hi, James, John. I hope you're both well. I've got a question on Asia Pacific, the performance in Q2, please, where volumes are up 3% and Price Mix was down 3%. Can you maybe just talk a bit more about the volumes up three and specifically how China performed and what you're seeing on the ground there in China in Q2, and then the Price Mix down 3%? Is that purely just negative geographic mix from India, Philippines, South Korea, and Japan, or was there negative pricing within that? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. I'll take it in reverse order, Charlie. Yeah, the negative pricing is more than driven by the Mix effect. So core pricing is positive if you went operating unit by operating unit. But overall Asia Price Mix is negative because of the way the mathematics of the thing works. But the central answer there is it's more than just geography mix. Geography mix is consuming core pricing and taking it down to minus three. Then if I go back to the performance of the different operating units, clearly the big swing in Asia Pacific is driven by the bounce back of India.\nYou'll remember that in Q1, India had a soft Q1, Q2 was very strong. And so that produces obviously a big swing in the results. So India had a good double-digit growth of volume in Q2.\nStill very bullish on India, still very realistic in terms of it won't be a straight line into the future, but they certainly had a good quarter in Q2. We also saw good volume growth across Southeast Asia, including also volume growth across Japan and South Korea. Volumes were negative in the China operating unit. There's two parts to this story. The first is yes, there's a general macro softness as the overall economy works through some of the structural issues around real estate pricing, etcetera, etcetera.\nBut within the things that we control, we have essentially been prioritizing and restructuring where we invest across the category portfolio and focusing more on sparkling, juice drinks, and teas and deprioritizing what is essentially case pack water where we don't make money in China.\nSo the overall volumes were negative in China, but that's entirely driven by the deprioritization of the water, and actually I think the sparkling volume was slightly positive in China for the quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question for John, please. Just kind of building on some of the questions earlier on cash flow. Can we get an update, please, on timing of potential bottler refranchising? And I think it's probably largely a question on CCBA, understanding that market conditions may potentially dictate. But can you help us how you're currently thinking about potential timing there, and then as you're thinking about value creation for shareholders, how much does EPS solution come into that? We hear that from shareholders sometimes, if at all, as you're thinking about moving forward with that. Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company",
    "content2": "Regarding the timing.\nWe're not giving out dates as to when we expect the refranchising process to finish. We're staying very thoughtful, disciplined in.\nRecruiting new partners in the areas that are still outstanding. And so there's good work underway, but no, no imminent decisions, and we'll advise as that work bears fruition. But I think the overall message is we continue to be very clear internally on the path forward, and we'll expect over the next couple of years to have the bulk of the refranchising done, if not all of it.\nWith regard to the impact on EPS dilution, it's a mechanical effect that comes from the broader strategic decisions that we believe are right for the Coca-Cola Company and over time for the Coca-Cola system. The refranchising work that started back in the mid-teens is demonstrating time and again that the overall system benefits when there's a step change in overall performance. With that step change we benefit over the longer haul.\nAs you've seen this year there is a mechanical impact on the EPS line, but longer term we think that the broader, the broader value proposition of the Coca-Cola Company, staying very focused on what we do best and having a balance sheet that's designed to support what we do best.\nWorking in partnership with great bottlers around the world is the recipe for us to meet and exceed our long-term growth model.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thanks for the question. Maybe I missed it, but did you make any commentary about your intentions on marketing investment for the year, whether anything's changed since the start of the year? I think you talked about maybe, you know, some surgical efforts in certain markets and certain categories.\nBut can I assume that there's no signal here that there needs to be incremental investment to improve volume?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nLet me attack the answer in a different way. Our bias is to lean in and invest where we see opportunities. To the extent that we continue to see opportunities, we continue to invest. If we see more opportunity, we'll invest more. The contrary is also true. If we see softness that doesn't warrant certain level of investment, we will look to pull back. Having said that, there's nothing particularly in the guidance that's trying to tell you it's changing radically in one direction or the other.\nWe continue to see the need for marketing pressure. It's not a fixed sum that is not subject to inflation, but there's nothing in the guidance that's trying to tell you something radically different. It's very much. We continue to invest and drive top line, and we see the two marching together.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robert. That was the last question. So to summarize.\nWe're building a culture that emphasizes improving every aspect of how we do business. We have lots of opportunities in front of us. We think we're well positioned to capture these opportunities, and we're confident that we will successfully execute our strategy and create value for our shareholders. So, stakeholders, thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website.\nThese reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the Company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, re-enter the queue to ask any follow-ups now. I will turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks Robin and good morning everyone. We're off to a good start this year as our Q1 results continued the momentum we've been building by executing our all weather strategy. The operating backdrop differed greatly across our markets once again, but our powerful portfolio coupled with our systems capabilities equip us with the agility we need to deliver on our 2024 guidance which we are updating today.\nThis morning I'll discuss the drivers in.\nThe quarter and how we used our scale and growth mindset to deliver these strong results. Then I'll highlight how we continue to meet consumer needs and grow our total beverage portfolio. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and updated 2024 guidance.\nIn Q1, we grew volume and expanded comparable margins, and we continue to invest across the business. We're managing currency fluctuations to deliver earnings growth, as shown by the 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 9% currency headwinds, and we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels across the world. We're continuing to win in the market by leveraging our scale and relying on our local expertise of our bottling partners in Asia Pacific. Momentum continued across a large portion of our business, including Japan and South Korea, Philippines, and Thailand. We gained traction in Indonesia with a return to volume growth.\nIndia's momentum was impacted by some temporary.\nFactors but recovered at the end of March. In China, retail sales growth continues to improve, but consumer confidence is still below 2019 levels. We remain optimistic about the many opportunities ahead of us, and we're stepping up our execution in a number of ways. For example, greater focus on our core business through a more segmented market approach and more surgical horizontal market execution. In EMEA, we're seeing gradual improvement in macro trends in Europe leading to improved consumer confidence. We paired Sprite with spicy meal occasions to drive momentum in away from home channels. Fused Tea and Powerade also generated strong performance, and Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola expanded to six more European markets during the quarter.\nAfrica saw continued volume momentum from last quarter while navigating a number of markets with significant currency devaluations. Geopolitical and economic challenges in Eurasia and the Middle East continue to affect our business in the region. We're working closely with local partners to manage these challenging dynamics, and we're committed to investing behind the strength of our brands for the long term. North America volume had a slow start to the quarter before posting sequential improvement in each of the last two months of the quarter, and elasticities remained favorable, leading to ongoing share gains. The launch of Coke Spice featured compelling in-store displays across our sparkling soft drink brands. Zero Sugar performance was strong, and we introduced 12-oz slim cans to further drive premiumization.\nValue-added dairy growth continued across Fairlife and Core Power in sports drinks notwithstanding the non-cash impairment charge that John will speak to in more detail. We believe our two-brand strategy with Powerade and BodyArmor is gaining traction and we've seen improved share trends. While we still have work to do, the stepped-up execution by our dedicated sales force is driving improved on-shelf execution and we're encouraged by the continued growth in sports water and the more recent BodyArmor innovations including Zero Sugar and Flash I.V.\nWhile inflation has moderated and wages continue to trend upward in North America, we're closely monitoring consumer sentiment and traffic trends between at home and away from home consumption in Latin America. Volume momentum continued. Performance was driven by strength in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia while Argentina continued to experience highly inflationary conditions.\nWe have quality leadership across our portfolio in Latin America with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continuing its strong performance.\nSparkling flavors, sports juices, and Alcohol Ready to Drink also performed well during the quarter. Commercial initiatives are driving improved shelf space and basket incidence, supported by ongoing outlet digitization. We have suggested order capabilities in digital platforms that reach more than three million customers in the region.\nAcross developed markets, the overall inflationary environment is normalizing. However, across developing emerging markets, there continues to be a handful of markets that are experiencing intense inflation, which is driving elevated pricing offset by incremental currency headwinds. We're proactively managing these volatile environments, and we feel confident we have the playbook to navigate challenges locally while continuing our momentum at a consolidated level. We're continuing to spin our strategic flywheel faster across Total Beverage Portfolio as discussed at CAGNY. We're building love brands, innovating, and delivering bigger, bolder bets. In the first quarter, we launched K-Wave as part of the Coca-Cola Creations platform in markets across five operating units. K-Wave celebrates Korean Pop or K Pop fans. It includes a global collaboration with three K-pop groups and an AI-based fan experience.\nOur growing number of co-creations are different with each iteration and by design are only available for a limited time. This generates buzz and excitement, building relevance for the brand and reconsideration for Coke with Gen Z drinkers. We also know that sometimes the most successful, lasting innovation is simply improving the taste of existing drinks. Using our deep in-house flavor expertise and understanding of the science of taste, we have worked to refine the recipes for Fanta and Sprite to meet consumer preferences across many markets. These changes bring new consumers to our brands as well as remind current consumers what drew them to their favorite beverages in the first place.\nThe strong Fanta performance in markets from Brazil to Germany to the US this quarter is largely due to this type of innovation, which was supported by marketing messages focused on taste and on tying the brand to snacking occasions and local festivals like Carnival in Brazil.\nElsewhere in our total Beverage portfolio, Minute Maid Zero Sugar kicked off its global campaign in North America, leveraging influencers, social media, and connected commerce activations with key customers.\nWe're building on our innovations by driving awareness and excitement through an increasingly digital marketing media mix. Our total beverage portfolio plays a lead role in, as shown by the New Guy campaign in the US this quarter, which featured multiple brands across categories. Innovation is woven into the fabric of our culture, and we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline as we look forward to the rest of 2024.\nMoving across the flywheel, we're leaning into integrated execution to drive basket incidence and create incremental value for customers. We worked closely with our bottling partners and went bigger with in-store displays to inspire transactions around key events like NCAA March Madness in the US, and we'll do this again later this summer with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. As a system to improve quality and availability, we increased outlets by 2%, added more than 600,000 cooler doors, and increased our share of cold space and overall shelf space in stores. We benefited from global scale while maintaining local relevance by tying our brands to regional meal occasions. For example, in Japan, we've associated Coke with Wagyu and Yakiniku through the path to purchase, using end-to-end consumer messaging and partnering with key customers in the modern trade and convenience retail.\nWe have seen strong Coca-Cola revenue growth in Japan.\nWhile we continue to grow our business, we also strive to positively impact the communities we serve. We do this by focusing on the issues that matter most to our system, and we share our status and learnings each year when we publish our Business and Sustainability Report. Putting it all together, it's early in the year, but we're off to a good start. We have confidence we will achieve our guidance for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results mark a continuation of the underlying momentum in our business driven by a strong and focused system. We delivered another quarter of volume growth even as we cycled strong results. Additionally, we completed the refranchising of several bottlers during the quarter, leading to further comparable margin expansion. We progressed on our refranchising agenda while making sure we best position our system to deliver long-term growth and we earn a fair return on our investments.\nWe continue to invest behind our portfolio with discipline and flexibility thanks to our enhanced resource allocation agenda.\nDuring the quarter, we grew Organic Revenues 11%. We had 1% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were behind unit case volume by three points driven by one less day in the quarter and the timing of concentrate shipments primarily in Mexico and the Middle East.\nOur price mix growth of 13% in the quarter was driven by approximately 6 points of intense inflationary pricing across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation, pricing actions across a number of markets, and a couple of points of favorable.\nMix.\nExcluding impacts from intense inflationary pricing. Organic revenue growth in the first quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds.\nComparable operating margin expanded approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and bottler refranchising partially offset by currency headwinds, and an increase in marketing investments. Markets experiencing intense inflation represent only a single digit contribution to our volume but continue to have an outsized impact on the shape of our P&L. Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.72 was up 7% year-over-year, including 9% currency headwinds which were driven by currency devaluation in markets experiencing intense inflation. Free cash flow was approximately $160 million, an increase from the prior year.\nBefore moving on, I want to discuss two items that are included in our first quarter reported results.\nA $765 million charge related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability for our acquisition of Fairlife. Our final payment related to the Fairlife acquisition will take place in 2025. This payment has grown as Fairlife has outperformed. We continue to be encouraged by our ability to scale Fairlife organically.\nSecondly, a non-cash impairment charge of $760 million related to BodyArmor. While we are taking a charge to reflect revised projections and a higher discount rate since the acquisition date of BodyArmor, we believe in the power of our two sports brand strategy. With Powerade and BodyArmor we're taking actions to help create long-term value and we're seeing signs that this strategy is working.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.6x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2x-2.5x. This gives us ample capacity for potential upcoming payments in 2024 related to the IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend, and the upcoming Fairlife payment in 2025.\nWe continue to remain consistent in our approach to prioritizing our capital allocation. We're committed to investing to drive growth and to support our dividend, which we have raised for 62 consecutive years.\nWe're confident our business model has the flexibility to allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the underlying momentum of our business, and we now expect organic revenue growth of 8%-9% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 11%-13%.\nOur revised top line guidance is solely driven by higher than expected inflationary pricing in a handful of markets which we expect to moderate throughout the year. Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a 4-5 point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2 point headwind to comparable earnings per share, but will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate four to five point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate seven to eight point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024.\nThis increase in currency headwind is driven by intense inflationary markets. While the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results.\nOur underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is now expected to be 19%.\nAll in. We continue to expect Comparable Earnings Per Share growth of 4% 5% versus $2.69 in 2023.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately a point of impact on volume growth during Q1 2024. It's unclear how long this impact will last.\nThe cadence of structural impact will be larger in the Q2 and Q3 due to the timing of transaction closing during the Q1 and the seasonality of the businesses we refranchised.\nFinally, there will be two additional days in Q4.\nTo sum it up. As James said, the year has started off well. We remain focused on the execution of our all-weather strategy. Thanks to the partnership of our system and the ongoing dedication of our people, we're confident we can create value for stakeholders and deliver on our guidance for the year.\nAs we said at CAGNY, we're primed for performance in 2024 and over the long term. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Brian Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nManaging Director, BofA\n\nThanks, operator.\nHey, good morning everyone. John, I wanted to ask a question about gross margins.\nYou know, in the quarter there was.\nAbout 100 basis points tailwind from structural.\nBenefits and then also structural change and.\nI think 60 basis points benefit underlying.\nIf we take that first.\nQuarter performance and kind of think about it over the balance of the year. Can you just give us some context of how we should be thinking, how much of that we should extrapolate going forward? Maybe what some of the headwinds, tailwinds would be. But just given the gross margins were so much better or gross profit dollars were so much better than we were all modeling, and just want to get a sense of how much of that we should bank in our estimates going forward.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Brian.\nAs we think about the full year, we're going to continue to have a tailwind from beyond the refranchising work that we have discussed. I think that's going to flow throughout the year.\nWe expect to continue to have some expansion as.\nReflected in our ongoing growth model driven by both positive RGM impacts and some productivity. The input horizon is more normalized. We do have some elevation on juice and sugar which we'll continue to have, but the net of it all is that we'll have some tailwind in the underlying area.\nCurrency will continue to be a headwind, and you can kind of extrapolate that out for the year. The net of it all is it'll be primarily driven by the refranchising efforts positively, some underlying expansion offset by the currency headwind. As we reflect in our guidance, the top line growth continues to be a primary driver, and the quality therein I think will ensure that on a sustained basis that expansion, albeit.\nNot as potentially aggressive every quarter, but that expansion will be in our favor going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. I was just hoping you could give a bit of a deeper dive into North America. A, just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing from the consumer. Any channel shifts in terms of away from home versus at home and the sequential improvement you discussed within Q1. Is that something that's expected to continue going forward? And then just B, price mix was very strong at 7% in North America. Can you unpack that between mix and pricing, and just how you think about the balance between pricing, mix, and volume going forward in the balance of the year in North America. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Morning, Dara.\nOverall, in terms of the consumer and how that fed into the channels.\nThe US Consumer remains in good shape. There is some purchasing power compression in the lower income echelons, and I think it's quite clear that there's some behavioral shift there. Looking for value, I think that has led to a marginal channel weighting or shift if you like, with slightly more at home volume versus away from home. I would emphasize this is at the periphery rather than a big shift, but at the margin, slightly more value seeking, slightly more at home, slightly less away from home. We've been stepping up our RGM efforts, our packaging efforts, and executing against that so that we have continued to gain share in the quarter. As it relates to pricing. Of the seven points in Q1, approximately two of those are mix or timing related.\nThe rest is pricing, and we expect that to moderate as the year goes on. We expect to see 2024 being a much more normal year in terms of pricing. In other words, it's largely going to be as it was pre-COVID. We're expecting to see 2024 end up with a much more balanced growth equation over the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about how the company manages when the dollar is strong. Outside of the markets with extreme inflation, we know from a strategic standpoint of course, the ongoing RGM efforts and PAC and channel and so on, but just from a more tactical standpoint when you're in a strengthening dollar environment, I was curious if you could share a bit more about how you manage that at a local level. Because the delivery of dollar-based EPS has become a key focus and hallmark, frankly in the last couple of years. I thought a bit more color on how you go about that in a more tactical sense could be helpful.\nThanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nMarkets outside the US will roughly break down into two types. There'll be those perhaps typified by Europe, Japan, Australia.\nSome of the obvious ones where the competition and the economic dynamics of the marketplace are predominantly local currency. In these markets our approach is to compete locally in local currency, given the cost structures in those areas. We generally marry that with a long-term.\nCurrency hedging or selling forward program such that we can have a clear anticipation of during the course of the year as to what that's likely to turn into. That's one set of markets, and we essentially have put ourselves in a position through the hedging program that we can compete locally and do what's necessary to continue to win in those marketplaces, which is generally what happens the second bucket of countries. That's much more apparent in recent quarters than even historically where you have.\nA higher, whether you want to say the chicken and the egg, a higher level of devaluation and a higher level of inflation. These tend to be more emerging market economies where there is less availability of economically attractive hedging programs, and so we don't tend to have hedged them. Also, given the elevated nature of the dynamic between the inflation and devaluation, we obviously are competing locally. For example, in the Argentinas of the world, we're competing predominantly locally to win in that marketplace and set ourselves up for the long term.\nIt's very cyclical.\nAs these markets cycle through high inflation and high devaluation. Sometimes the dollar value of those businesses shoots up, and sometimes it shoots down. At the moment, they're in the phase of shooting down in dollar terms. They're declining in dollar terms even though they're growing a lot in currency neutral terms. We look at it on a long-term basis to win using the RGM and all the other investments we make in the business. Of course they're not all in sync with each other. It's a portfolio management crisis and then overlaid.\nThat is, of course, a corporate approach in terms of prioritization of where and how to invest, whether to lean in and lean in with what sorts of investments, such that we are able to deliver on our corporate-level commitment to make sure that at the end of it, the sum of all the competing locally is more than the sum of the parts, such that we can deliver a consistent level of US dollar EPS growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning, James and John.\nYou both mentioned, you know, incremental progress on the two brand strategy and sports.\nDrinks with BodyArmor and Powerade.\nI was hoping you could expand a.\nBit more on what you're seeing there.\nThat gives you that encouragement and what.\nYou see as the key initiatives for that strategy as we go forward. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nClearly we haven't progressed as fast as we would like with regard to BodyArmor, notwithstanding the step up in the discount rate. That's reflected as John talked earlier in the charge, notwithstanding that we do see long-term value in the dual strategy, particularly in the US between Powerade and BodyArmor. We're off to a good start with some of the plans.\nThe zero calorie version is ahead of expectations, the Flash I.V. has got some double-digit share, and the SportWater version is one of the fastest growing premium water brands. Some product innovation that's getting some traction. A new partnership with NHL on the marketing front and on the execution front, a stepping up of the merchandising and sales force focus directed just at the sports drinks category, which is helping improve the share trend in the category, although not at the rate we had hoped initially, but we think we are in good shape going forward. Obviously we'll have an opportunity with the Olympics to really continue to step that up. Plans in place across the product innovation, the marketing, and the execution, and we think this will come to fruition over the course of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping for a little more color on your performance in Asia in the quarter and then whether it met your expectations or possibly fell short. Also, you mentioned that declines in China more than offset growth in some of your key markets in the region. Maybe just hoping for a little bit more color on your business in China and how quickly you expect the market will recover, again, given the broader macro challenges in the region. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Well, let's go around Asia quickly. I mean, China.\nWe are cycling in the first quarter, a very strong Chinese New Year and first quarter from 2023. I think we had a solid, a solid quarter in China. We focus very much on having a good Chinese New Year sparkling, which was good. We deprioritize some of the lower value water in order to do so. As we commented earlier, the Chinese confidence isn't as strongly rebounded as some of the other markets versus 2019. We see an overall environment where there'll be growth, perhaps not as the top historic levels, but be growth. We're there, we're very much focused on what we can control and the things we need to do. There's still huge opportunities in the Chinese marketplace, notwithstanding the macros.\nThere's a lot we can execute against in the marketing, in the innovation, in the execution, in the marketplace, in the stores, and with RGM. There's a lot for us to achieve that's within our control in China. In the rest of Asia, we had a good quarter in Japan and South Korea, good share gains, really starting to pick up the pace also. Likewise, we had a strong performance in the Philippines, which is an important market for us. That was good in the quarter. The one that was atypical or at least compared to recent quarters, was India at a slower start in January and February. As we've talked in previous calls, we're very bullish on the long term prospects for the Indian business. We're also very clear it's not going to be a straight line of metronomically consistent growth.\nIt wasn't in Q1. It was a little softer. January, February. But March and April have now bounced back, and so we expect to see India continue to have a strong year this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. Can you comment on EMEA? You called out Nigeria, Germany, and South Africa, growing unit case and driving the growth in volumes. If my math is correct, ex inflationary countries, your price mix in the rest of EMEA was about 7%. Can you comment on the state of the consumer there, similar to what you said about the US, and if you feel the 7% price mix in more stable countries is sustainable going forward? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. EMEA also this quarter had a whole series of moving pieces as you started on price mix. Clearly, there's a number of countries in there with very high inflation. Not just Nigeria, but also Turkey, and somewhat mathematically unlikely, some of the smaller African countries, given the level of inflation, can also make a difference to the pricing lever.\nIn the EMEA segment. The EMEA segment has a substantive piece of pricing, that is the inflationary marketplaces, including many markets you wouldn't normally suspect. That's a roundabout way of saying actually the pricing in Europe is much more.\nNormalized, and a bit like the US, we both see improved macros. Actually, I think today a number of the markets came out and said they'd come out of recession from the previous quarters. Like the US, we see the lower income consumers remaining under pressure, and at the margin slightly more shift towards value-oriented channels at home, oriented channels, and lesser.\nAway from home. Clearly that's related to our focus not just on the marketing and the innovation, but the RGM, affordability, and driving premiumization. Europe not too dissimilar a story compared to the US, but the EMEA segment mixes in both the Middle East conflict and quite a number of the high inflation countries.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning. I want to ask about brand Coca-Cola Trademark Coca-Cola relative to the sparkling flavor businesses. I think unit case for sparkling flavors outperformed Trademark Coca-Cola in 2021 and in 2022. But this normalized into the back half of 2023. That's continued into Q1 of this year. Can you just perhaps expand on, you know, whether there's anything distinct that's occurring here between brand or Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors? Regional considerations, brand considerations. I just think it's noteworthy given the relative outperformance that has just turned under way a little bit. Any context would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah.\nLook, clearly both Trademark Coke Original Taste, Coke Zero have been having a good run over the last number of years.\nReally focused on performance. But also perhaps unlike in times more recently past, Sprite and Fanta have also been doing well. This has been an intentional focus for the company and the bottling system, which historically we have looked at and managed sparkling altogether and very deliberately. A number of years ago, we separated to really focus in on Coke, the Coke Trademark, on its own with all the innovations, whether they be like things like the K-Wave innovations or continuing to focus on Coke Zero with the updated formulas or focusing on original taste Coke with the Marvel activations. That's just one real focus on Coke, and that has been part of what has driven success over the last number of years. Ultimately for the company to do well, Coke has to do well.\nIt's a mathematical certainty and that has certainly been what's driving the company. Then the separation of Sprite, Fanta, and some of the regional brands, particularly perhaps some of the Indian soft drink brands like Thums Up.\nHave really got their own deserved focus. Actually, if you put all the flavored sparkling brands together, they would be one of their own. They'd be one of their own big FMCG companies in their own right. Really what you're seeing is this focus on the formulas of Fanta and Sprite really doing much better and being teamed up each time we brought it to marketplace with a full marketing package. For example, Fanta in the US had a good run as we updated the formula and relaunched the marketing. I think it's been doing really well. I think the only place where we've not succeeded, particularly with some of the flavors in the Chinese marketplace. For example, given that's really a Sprite question there that we need to continue to focus on to do better with Sprite in China.\nBut otherwise Fanta, Sprite, and particularly the Indian flavor brands have done very well. Of course Coke is a pretty broad-based success story.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nStock Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on the Latin America business, clearly there's a lot of impact from hyperinflation in the market, but.\nThe volume trends continue to remain very solid in the region from a unit case standpoint.\nSo maybe can you talk about the consumer environment there, and do you think you can continue to see volume growth in Latin America going forward, and some of your key initiatives in the region? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, thanks.\nThe simple answer is yes, we believe the business can continue to grow in Latin America both in volume and revenue terms. It's been a long-term success part of the business with a very strong system between ourselves and the bottlers focused on the marketing, the innovation, the execution, and the RGM. We'll continue to build on the recent years momentum. Performance this quarter was strong, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. Obviously Argentina was impacted by the macroeconomic conditions, but we have a very tight system. We're very focused on what needs to be done and continuing to invest in capacity in order to continue to unlock the volume growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning everyone. Hope you're doing well.\nJohn, I had a question.\nAs it pertains to the fairlife liability, clearly this is a sign that the underlying business is doing extremely well. We've also seen the value of this liability increase quite a bit over the last year or so. As we look ahead, is there anything you can share, any guardrails you can provide in terms of how we should think about the liability changing as we move through the balance of the year and into 2025? Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThe liability is very much linked to the ultimate performance. As we close out this quarter, we're reflecting our latest and best estimates as to what that will be. The momentum of the business has been very strong, and actually I think it's going to continue, and if anything there may be some more upside. For now we're reflecting our best estimates for what that liability ultimately would be.\nJust to keep in mind that.\nThe liability will be. It's an early 2025 ending to it.\nWe'll update as we go through this year in the event that the projections evolve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just a little bit more question on the innovation side. Certainly it's been an innovative company over the past four or five years, more new products out there, but it's tough to track some of these products that have been launched that are still on the shelf a year or two years later. The question is, are there things in place in terms of percentage of sales should come from new products in a certain region in a year or number of new products that need to be launched per year? Just trying to understand, I understand you're wanting to be more innovative, but what guardrails or what accountability there is around t innovation?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. I think the first thing is to.\nBear in mind a certain segmentation of the innovation.\nWhat I mean by that is, you've got a strong focus on a part of the innovation that's around renovation of the core. You get into a question of okay, well, is the new Coke Zero formula or the updated Fanta formula backed with a new marketing campaign? Are you going to count that as innovation or not? the first thing is to understand that there's different types of innovation at play here, all driving the business, one being in a sense the renovation of core brands. Secondly.\nLaunches intended to be ins and outs of some of the co-creations where really the focus is on.\nRegarding engaging with consumers in a novel way to drive relevance of the core brand. You're not expecting them to last. And then of course there are things we're putting into the marketplace that are new innovations, whether it would be something like a Minute Maid Zero Sugar or.\nSomething like the Absolut & Sprite or the Jack Daniel's & Coca-Cola. These things. Then, of course, you've got non-product-based innovation like it's a new bottle size or a new can size. We track across all these things as it relates to product innovation. We have a very clear set of metrics on whether it's still growing on the fifth quarter quarter after its launch. Is it cycling itself and continuing to accelerate? There's a lot of clear measures, but we do not set ourselves an artificial strategy objective of it has to be x percent from innovation. As it happens, about 25% of the growth comes from innovation, but it is not set that way. In the end, we are not setting ourselves up to sell what we make. We've got to sell what the consumers want to buy.\nIt's about doing justice to every brand, every idea, every package, every channel, and then service. That resulting demand, if that is led by great new innovation or by 138th year of classic Coke, then that's the answer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nAnalyst, SBC\n\nYes, good morning.\nJames.\nMarket development is a cult, right? It's a philosophy and it seems to.\nMe that so much of what you're.\nDoing, and what you talked about today, is intended to get shelf replenishers to become better market developers for faster growth.\nCan you speak to how this is?\nThis evolution is going in the system?\nAre there any regions or countries that?\nStand out for momentum in this system? Transformation of moving toward richer market development. To less shelf replenishment, order taking?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Look, I think each part of the world is in its journey to continue to add value.\nTo the retailer, because in the end, this is about, you know, together with the bottlers, making sure that we are adding value to the retailer's business. Our objective at the retail level is to grow the beverage category faster than the average of their business. For us to grow our portfolio of brands faster than the beverage category, and to do that, we've got to add more value. That takes different forms in different places.\nAs that happens, for example, the pre sellers, they move from just order taking to account development. As AI comes in, it generates a suggested order for the retail outlet that is demonstrably more efficient in helping the retailer drive sales and then allows the salesperson to do more account development and to expand on different ideas. At each stage it's about taking the system capabilities to the next level so that we can continue to add value for the retailer. Everything that was done in the past starts to become the price of entry in the future. We need to keep adding value. I think there's a strong growth in capabilities all around the world, specifically focused on the channel structure that the bottlers have in any given market.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nIf I may just add, James, I think one of the big changes in the last three to five years is that the ambition that we share respectively with all of our bottling partners is much more at the high end of what it should be than scattered. I think that's. Then it's working backwards from there as to what does it take to deliver that ambition. Some are further along than others. The ambition is that starting point that I think is helping to.\nDrive the progress that we're seeing each quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi there.\nJust a couple of clarifying questions, James. I think on the last earnings call you were very clear that you viewed the business.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nWe can't hear you.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nMy apologies.\nCan you hear me now?\nYeah.\nI think last quarter you spoke very specifically about the business being a 2% unit volume grower. Given the timing impacts, is that still how you would view this year?\nThen secondly, can you be a?\nLittle more specific about those timing differences in Mexico, and I think the Middle.\nEast between units and concentrate, you know.\nWhat causes those discrepancies and do they naturally reverse in the coming quarter?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Yes. Timing differences naturally reverse between concentrate units and unit cases. Partly it happens when there is a different number of days in the quarter than we have. We use the 4-4-5 system for all reasons. What that causes sometimes is different numbers of shipping days in quarters. You undersell when you got less days like the first quarter. Of course in the fourth quarter this year when there's two extra days, there'll be way more concentrate units than there were cases, relatively speaking. Over the course of time these anomalies or differences reverse themselves or average themselves out. Then as regards to the 2% volume. Yes, look, I have a very strong view that our overall ambition to see our revenue grow at the top end of the algorithm.\nI'm leaving aside the intense inflation countries for the sake of the argument. At the moment, we want to grow at that 5%-6% range, and we want that to have a balanced contribution from volume and price mix. Implicitly looking for 2%-3% on volume. And I think we talked last quarter that in the current circumstances, that's likely to be slightly less volume and slightly more prices as prices and inflation normalizes. I think that 2% is still a pretty good number. It's certainly been the average growth rate in volume over. If you take a compound number over the last number of years, you're going to get something like a 2%. That seems to be the momentum we're driving. And that if you strip away.\nThe inflation and the weirdness in the first quarter, what you see is you got that 1% volume which given the Middle East headwind of 1% and actually recycling the strongest quarter last year, you could say it's a good volume number. It has good underlying price mix in the normal countries. The normal performance is right at the top end of the algorithm. There's and then that feeds its way through to a 7% EPS growth. I think right in there. The main business notwithstanding the peripheral noise is humming away right in line with where we said we wanted to be.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRob Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you. Just like to drill down both on.\nThe US and the volume question.\nCan you talk about your expectations for?\nVolume growth in North America this year? What it'll take to get volume growth? Is it a function of more the economy, more the comps, more the sectors, and tied to the sectors or categories? I think you mentioned that tea, coffee, and water were very weak. Any color around that? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nI mean clearly in the case of the US we've commented in previous calls that our expectation would be flat to modest growth in volume on a long term basis in North America with good pricing. Clearly that remains our overall ambition, whether we get from the flat to something more positive in the rest of the year will obviously be a combination of what we execute against and the trajectory of the purchasing power of the economy in the balance of the year. We're very focused on continuing to build the business, drive the revenue, and continue to win in the marketplace and we'll see where that nets out too. Th\nWhere we were doing well and where not, clearly, we had a strong quarter in terms of sparkling, in terms of some of the other categories in North America, dairy, obviously the Fairlife additional charge, as John talked about, as the earn out is in last year, very strong quarter on dairy, very strong on sparkling, actually good on juice, the water, and the tea. Obviously to some extent, obviously the sports categories were a little softer. Some of it on the water was selling less of the kind of the case back water, and tea, I think, was very much a question. We just need to focus a little more on some of what needs to be done there. But it was more on the the Fuze Tea end of the spectrum rather than the Gold Peak end of the spectrum, which tends to do better.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Callum Elliot from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCallum Elliot\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\nI have a slightly longer term.\nQuestion on gross margins. In 2015 your gross margin was 61%, I think, and you had published a slide at CAGNY in 2016 showing that you expected gross margins to get to 68% post the refranchising that had been announced at the time.\nToday we're still around 60% over the past 12 months, and recognizing you guys weren't in your current seats in 2016 when that slide was published. My question is, what's happened? I'm sure you'll point to M and A Costa, BodyArmor, CCBA, et cetera, but I don't think they come close to explaining the 800 basis points of delta. And I don't think that FX explains the gap either. What else is it? Has refranchising maybe just not been as margin accretive as you expected, or is there some kind of other structural drag that hadn't been anticipated back in 2016? Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, actually I think it does explain. I think it does explain what's happened. I don't have the breakdown in front of me, but at the gross margin level, when you take into account the impact of currency of some of the bottler acquisitions that came back into our portfolio that we're now in the process of refranchising, and some of the other acquisitions, I think they have had a mechanical impact, and we can come back with a little bit more color on that. Then I think when you look at the operating income and how it flows down into operating income line.\nPrimary driver.\nAre these items?\nYeah, don't have it in front of me. We can follow up in a bit more detail.\nYeah, that's the story.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrett Cooper\n\nAnalyst, Consumer Edge Research\n\nThank you.\nGood morning. Just wanted to ask on your digital experience, B2B, and if you can share any quantification when you win B2B or you get B2B into independent retailers, what happens to your space, your share, category performance relative to a baseline that isn't there? It's not so much a question of the 8% increase in the quarter, but looking back over time. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company",
    "content2": "Again, I don't know if something was up with the line today that was very broken up, but I think Brett, you were asking about the digital experiences in C2B and what happened in shares in the category.\nThere are multiple. B2B is not a singular thing, and the digital version of B2B is not a singular thing. There is a vast amount of B2B business that has been done for many years with direct order transfers largely to large store modern retailers, where order replenishment has a long-standing track record and is really focused on the efficiency of making sure the shelf is not out of stock from products, and is more a process of support to what already goes on. Actually you see it as it's enabling the physical presence in the the analog world if you like. Of course there's other types of B2B.\nFor example, in the mom and pop stores where we have moved heavily from a you have to wait for the pre seller to appear type of relationship with the mom and pop stores to where that is complemented by some sort of ordering and relationship platform. They come in multiple guises depending on where you are in the world and the relative need and cost efficiency of doing so. Those platforms allow retailers effectively to be able to order, make additional orders 24/7, maybe even book servicing for their cold drink equipment.\nFollow loyalty programs, et cetera, et cetera. There's a lot of different types of B2B relationships. Generally speaking they are supportive of us continuing to grow the relationship and.\nTo.\nContinue to do well, but they are enabling rather than consumer facing. So the kind of the share is a little trickier to determine.\nOkay, I think that was the last one. To summarize, Q1 of the year, strong start. We're confident we can continue to create value for the stakeholders and share owners and deliver on our 2024 guidance. We'll continue to manage through the many different types of environments out there, but focus on leveraging our capabilities to drive what we can control, to make sure we get growth. Thank you for your interest, your investment in the company, and joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mrs. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Mrs. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nYou can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, re-enter the queue to ask any follow-ups. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. In 2023, we achieved our near-term goals while also positioning our business for the long-term. Our all weather strategy delivered 8% comparable earnings per share growth despite greater than expected 7% currency headwinds. Today, we are leveraging our scale globally and winning locally, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 guidance. This morning I'll talk about the global consumer landscape then I'll highlight how our strategy and enhanced capabilities are making us a more agile and effective organization. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and our 2024 guidance.\nDuring the quarter, we benefited from strong performance across many of our markets. However, some were impacted by elevated inflation and others by geopolitical tensions and conflict. We delivered 12% organic revenue growth which included two points of volume growth, continuing a positive volume trend for the year. Throughout, we continue to invest in our business to provide the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and attract more drinkers.\nWe drove industry growth and delivered value share gains in the quarter and for the full year. We achieved these results by effectively navigating a number of headwinds and capitalizing on tailwinds across our markets. During the quarter, we saw strong consumer demand across Australia, India, Latin America, Japan, and South Korea. In North America, consumer spending in aggregate is holding up well and in Europe, consumers remain cost conscious. In Africa and China, the macro environment remains uncertain and in the Middle East, tensions have resulted in some shifts in consumer behavior that have had an impact on our business.\nAnother important factor to highlight is the inflationary pressures which are moderating or stabilizing across most of our markets. To keep consumers in our franchise, we are leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to tailor our offerings and price pack architecture to meet consumers' evolving needs. In North America and Europe, while inflation is moderating, the cumulative impact of inflation is pressuring certain consumer segments who are seeking value. Throughout 2023, we increased our affordability offerings and won volume and value share in both regions.\nIn Latin America, despite double-digit inflation during Q4, we grew volume 4% and increased household penetration and basket incidence. There are a few pockets of the world that are experiencing hyperinflation. John will later speak to how this dynamism is impacting our business. However, I did want to mention that our local franchise operating model allows us to navigate through hyperinflationary environments and then gain an advantage over the long-term.\nAcross our business, we continue to prioritize agility and focus on improving every aspect of how we operate, an important part of this is our marketing transformation. To recruit the next generation of drinkers, our marketing has shifted from a TV-centric model to a digital-first organization that balances local intimacy, scale, and flexibility. Our digital mix has gone from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% of our total media spend. In 2023, we stood up Studio X, the digital ecosystem that brings this all together. We created physical hubs in each of our operating units to integrate disciplines, standardize data and technology, and step change our capabilities.\nCreative media, social, and production capabilities are now operating at scale, connected by our global network structure. In our previous model, it took several months to create a TV ad. Now we're producing thousands of pieces of digital content that are contextually relevant and measuring these results in real time. Digital X is driving tangible results. For example, Coke Studio, which originated in Pakistan and taps into consumers' passion for music, has been scaled to our top 40 markets.\nThe campaign uses packaging as digital portals to access real magic experiences which has generated more than 1.2 billion YouTube views and 100 million music streams this year, resulting in strong recruitment of Gen Z drinkers. We're engaging differently with consumers and it's delivering results. In 2023, according to Kantar, Coca-Cola brand value increased $8 billion. Coke is now the 10th most valuable brand in the world, up seven spots from the prior year. In the U.S., Sprite was named by Morning Consult as the number one beverage brand for Gen Z drinkers. We were also named one of the top 10 innovative companies in Augmented and Virtual Reality by Fast Company.\nOur innovation agenda is increasing our competitive advantage across our products, packaging, and equipment. Taste is the starting point. Simply put, people want drinks that taste great. To drive superiority across our total beverage portfolio, we're continuing to build capabilities to tap into unique insights in taste and aroma science. We're applying digital tools, ingredient processing technology and AI to create bolder and more successful innovations.\nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar is an ongoing example of how superior taste drives demand. With volume that grew 5% in 2023, leading to continued volume and value share gains. We're applying learnings from this multi-year success and driving taste superiority elsewhere in our Sparkling portfolio. In 2023 we launched Sprite and Fanta reformulations in 25 markets delivering mid-single-digit volume growth in those markets and driving overall sparkling flavors value share gains. Outside of our sparkling portfolio, we're dialing up flavor profiles, adding functional benefits, expanding into new categories.\nIn Japan, we relaunched Georgia Coffee, which generated broader customer interest and led to value share gains. In the U.S., fairlife's Core Power and Nutrition Plan offer high-protein dairy without compromising taste. In 2023, fairlife grew volume 15%, its ninth consecutive year of double-digit volume growth. We're also seeing continued promising results from Fuze Tea across Europe, Jack and Coke in the Philippines, Flashlyte in Mexico, among many others.\nIn 2023, innovation contributed to approximately 30% of gross profit growth and our success rates have nearly tripled compared to 2019 levels. Our Revenue Growth Management execution capabilities continue to be distinct advantages as demonstrated by our ability to deliver volume and transaction growth despite ongoing inflationary pressures. We're working with our bottling partners to capture every opportunity available to create significant value for consumers and customers. By offering a total beverage portfolio in the right packages and at the right price points, we're driving category expansion and becoming more relevant to more consumers and customers.\nIn North America, we're evolving packaging options across more distribution points to drive affordability and premiumization. On the affordability side, our 1.25 liter PET bottles are now available in 80% of supermarkets and our 16-oz can distribution increased by 14 points in convenience stores during 2023. We're also focused on premiumization through the expansion of our Mini can offerings. During the quarter, we launched 15 pack mini cans in grocery and club channels. In Europe, we're leveraging the same playbook but adapting it to local needs. In Spain, our 1.25-liter PET package is offered at a compelling price point and it drove 16% volume growth and increased household penetration in 2023.\nIn Italy, Great Britain, and Ireland, we drove premium single serve Mini cans and smaller package offerings to generate positive mix and incremental retail sales. Our franchise system uniquely combines the benefits of scale and knowledge sharing with the know-how needed to execute for customers and win locally in many different operating environments. For example, approximately 70% of purchase decisions are influenced at point of sale. Our system stepped up in-store displays during the quarter, which drove incremental retail sales and cross-selling opportunities.\nPutting it all Together, we created $15 billion in incremental retail sales for our customers in 2023, more than any other beverage company. This was our sixth year in a row as the leader in value creation. While we're pleased with our progress, we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available. Our system is galvanized to move further and faster.\nBefore I hand over to John, I want to acknowledge that none of this could happen without the unwavering dedication of our employees. As we turn to 2024, we expect the year will bring new challenges and opportunities, and we remain ready to respond through continuing to improve execution of our strategy across our total beverage portfolio. I look forward to sharing more next Tuesday at CAGNY, and I encourage everyone to listen in. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we delivered strong results. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 12%, which was in line with our full year organic revenue growth. Unit case growth was 2% and was positive in each quarter of 2023. Concentrate sales grew one point ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by one additional day in the quarter. Our price mix growth of 9% in the quarter was driven by three factors. One, 2023 pricing actions across most of our markets, two hyperinflationary pricing that I'll speak to in just a moment, and three some mix, which is mostly timing related.\nComparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 140 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments.\nThe positive volume and top-line growth that we're realizing today demonstrates the effectiveness of our marketing spend. Below the line, comparable other income declined primarily due to the operating environment in Argentina. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.49 was up 10% year-over-year despite higher than expected 13% currency headwinds. Before moving on, I want to discuss the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets on our fourth quarter results.\nDuring the quarter, inflation intensified and exceeded 60% across these markets. In aggregate, while they represent less than 5% of our total volume, this degree of inflation creates a cosmetic distortion to our underlying results. In the fourth quarter, these markets contributed more than 3 points of our price mix and most of our currency headwinds including an outsized impact to comparable other income from balance sheet remeasurements in Argentina. They did not, however, have a material impact on our earnings per share results.\nIn hyperinflationary markets, it's either impractical or impossible to hedge our currency exposure and to manage it, we use our full suite of revenue growth management tools, including pricing actions, to keep pace with local market inflation. We have been operating a long time in these markets, and we expect to be in them for a long time to come. We work hand in hand with our local bottling partners, and our focus will be to continue to nurture the strong relationships we have with our consumers and customers, and to ultimately prevail longer-term.\nWhile we will continue to experience volatility of this nature in a few markets, it's important to keep in mind they are operated locally. They are typically self-funding, and they have not impeded our overall ability to grow earnings per share. As we move forward, we are confident our business model, and the many levers within it, will allow us to deliver on our overall objectives.\nIn 2023, free cash flow was $9.7 billion, which increased from the prior year. 2023 free cash flow included a transition tax payment of approximately $720 million which was approximately $340 million higher than the prior year and included approximately $230 million in M&A related payments. Our underlying free cash flow growth was largely attributable to strong operational performance and working capital benefits.\nIf you exclude the full impact of the transition tax and M&A related payments, our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio would be within our target range of 90-95%. Our balance sheet remains strong and our net debt leverage of 1.7x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2-2.5x. During the fourth quarter, in addition to offsetting dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees, we repurchased additional shares in anticipation of expected proceeds from Bottler Refranchising. As James mentioned, we anticipate 2024 will bring new challenges and opportunities. However, through our all-weather strategy, we've proven we can deliver in many different operating environments.\nOur 2024 guidance builds on the underlying momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 6-7% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 8-10%. We anticipate hyperinflationary pricing will continue to play a role in 2024 but will moderate throughout the year. We continue to make significant progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations. Bottler Refranchising is expected to be a 4-5 point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2 point headwind to comparable earnings per share will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2-3% currency headwind to comparable net revenues, and an approximate 4-5% currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Notably, much of our anticipated 2024 currency headwinds are attributed to hyperinflationary markets, with a meaningful impact in the first quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be 19.2%. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4-5% versus $2.69 in 2023.\nWe expect to generate approximately $9.2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments. The $11.4 billion of cash from operations includes two items to highlight, transition tax payments of approximately $960 million, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2023 payments associated with various MA transactions of approximately $560 million, an increase of approximately $330 million versus 2023.\nDriven by our underlying cash flow generation and current balance sheet strength, we have ample flexibility to both reinvest in our business to drive growth and return capital to our shareowners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment increase is to build capacity for fairlife and for our India business, both of which experienced robust growth in 2023.\nRelated to capital return, we have unwavering priority to grow our dividend as we've done with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. With respect to share repurchases, we'll be flexible in our approach. Typically, we've repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritizes agility. We're committed to taking the right actions needed to drive the long-term health of our business and create value for our stakeholders.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind for 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 in some markets and cycling our strongest volume growth quarter from the prior year. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. It's unclear how long this impact will last.\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Tax Court rendered its supplemental opinion related to our ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. We intend to move forward on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We have ample balance sheet flexibility to fund any payment related to the appeal. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter.\nIn summary, we're pleased with what we accomplished in 2023. We're building on our capabilities to continue the underlying momentum across our markets, we're progressing on our refranchising agenda and we're reinvesting in our system to drive long-term growth. We have great confidence we can deliver on our 2024 guidance and long-term commitments. With that operator, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question you'll need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning everyone. I know John just went through a lot of details on the guide, but I did just want to step back and maybe go to a higher level conversation on this because for 2023 you ended up with high single digit earnings growth even with that 7% currency headwind. The initial guide for 2024 for mid single digit earnings growth feels like a reasonable starting point. Can you just contextualize a bit how you're thinking about the impact of hyperinflation? John mentioned, the Middle East tensions, the consumer backdrop, etc. You're able to come through with that U.S. dollar-based earnings growth outlook for the year. Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Morning Lauren. A couple of things. Firstly, the mid-single-digit growth in 2024 is after the impact of the refranchising that we've called out. In other words, pre structural change, that's really six to seven. Second, what I think 2024 represents is ultimately a continuation of the underlying strength and momentum in the business that's being created. If you look at 2023 or you look all the way back to 2019, take five years if you like, what is captured within that is the kernel of the core business running at the top end of the growth algorithm.\nYes, there's been inflation and distractions and up and downs, but in the end running through that is a continuous amount of volume growth. As we focus on our consumer franchise and keeping people in and growing the weekly plus consumers in our franchise, managing the cycle of inflation that is now distinct depending on where you are in the world. Managing that cycle of inflation such that we now have, in the majority of the countries, 90%+ of the countries, normalized levels of pricing more or less coming out of 2023.\nWhat you see in this guidance is really the core business and the 90%+ of the countries really look taking that combination of headwinds and tailwinds that we've experienced. There'll be a different set in 2024, there are bound to be some new surprises, but we will manage through them with our all weather strategy and deliver volume growth growth in the consumer base with weekly plus, we'll earn our right to take an appropriate level of pricing and deliver at the top end of the growth algorithm.\nThere's the overlay of the inflationary markets and the selling of the bottling investment groups that we've done.That hyperinflation over is, as John said, a few points on the top and obviously some on the bottom, and largely offset by the devaluation. Those two things go together. Captured within that is a strong core growing top and bottom in line with the growth algorithm.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow up there. As you think about that 6-7% organic sales growth guidance for 2024, can you just give us a bit more detail on volume versus pricing on the underlying business, maybe ex the hyperinflationary markets just as we think about that balance between volume and pricing? James, just more importantly, longer-term, perhaps you can just take a step back and review your confidence in delivering that long-term top line algorithm and the higher end of that algorithm.\nJust as you look out over the next few years. Taking a look back at the last few years, there's obviously been a lot of volatility hard for us to judge from an external perspective given all the volatility with COVID, but how do you think about the success of the strategic initiatives you've put in place the last few years, and what level of confidence that gives you in the long-term looking out a few years? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. I'll try to do justice to the various angles there. Let me unpack a little bit 2023 and the end of 2023 as a way of coming into 2024. In 2023 we had 2% volume growth. That was true in the fourth quarter, and it was true through the year. Actually, if you take a five-year CAGR, we've been running at 2% volume growth for the last five years. Start with the volume. There's been strong underlying volume growth in the last quarter, in the last year, in the last five years. That's there. That's true because we focused on building momentum in the system around building the consumer franchise.\nWhen you look at how that's come along with pricing, obviously there's the pandemic, the ups and downs, and inflation but let's just break apart 2023 and how that then flows into 2024. If you look at Q4 2023, it says 9%. Yeah, it says 9%. As John pointed out, there's a couple of points there that's related to intra year quarter-to-quarter deduction timing, so take off the two and you get a seven. Of the remaining seven, half of it is normal pricing in the 95% of the business that's not hyperinflationary, and the other 3.5% is in the hyperinflationary countries because the inflation is so high.\nReally what have you got in the fourth quarter? You've got 2% volume, you've got 3.5%, a bit more than 3.5% price, price mix and that's the core there. You've got something that's running bang in the center of the long-term growth algorithm of 5-6% on the top line. It was true in fourth quarter, it's true as a general in the whole of 2023. Actually it's really true across the whole of the last five years once you take out some of these inflationary distortions and the selling of the bottling. There it is running the last quarter, the last year, the last five years.\nThink about 2024. We're going to go, as we've always said, for a balance of volume and price. In that 95% of the business, we're going to see volume growth and we're going to see normalized pricing growth. Our aim is for the net of the two to be in that top end of the long-term growth algorithm for revenue growth. Yes, there's going to be an overlay of hyperinflation. There's probably more like a couple of points as we think about 2024 on the top line and that's why you get what we've called out in terms of the top line growth.\nHopefully that unpacks a bit of how price mix has got this hyperinflation distortion. It actually has also got the selling of the bottlers if you don't do it on comparable but really embedded in that six to seven is a keep hitting the long-term growth on revenue for the sixth year. We feel the momentum we've built with our bottling partners investing in the marketing, the innovation, the in-store execution, the execution, the marketplace with the RGM strategies across the global portfolio of geographies gives us strong confidence we will continue with our momentum.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning. I actually had a question on gross margins. I was hoping for a little bit more color on the drivers of your expansion in Q4, which came in better than expected. Could you highlight the key puts and takes on margins this year? Curious, how much do you expect COGS inflation maybe to moderate or will higher sugar costs continue to be a big headwind? Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Bonnie. Let me start by just picking up from where James left off, and step out of both the quarter and the year. If you look over the last four years, we've been able to sustain a pretty resilient growth margin line, and as we go into 2024, expect to be able to continue to do so. There's some expansion embedded in the long-term growth model, and we're confident that we can continue to drive that. With respect to 2023, the key ingredients, so to speak, were the impact of the various pricing actions we've had around the world somewhat offset by higher than normal inflation with some of our commodity items, and indeed some of our non-commodity costs.\nOverall for 2023, that's the key story. In 2024, I think you need to take into account the mechanical impact on, of the refranchising of those markets that we talked about in the release that will layer in throughout 2024. Keep in mind too the impact of foreign currency headwinds. Against that then we will continue to drive the levers that we have. I've talked about this in the past, but maybe worth just highlighting, we start really with the, with that suite of revenue growth management tools and the many actions that we can take with that.\nWe have a very resilient supply chain, tremendous partners across the supply chain. We source mostly locally, and we continue to drive through our scale a lot of productivity in almost each line item of what comprises the supply chain. Going into 2024, I think it's worth just reiterating; we expect to see margin expansion, some of it driven by that mechanical effect of the bottler refranchising. With some more normalized cost inflation relative to the last couple of years, plus continuing to deploy those levers I talked about, we see the opportunity to continue to drive per our long-term growth model expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Spillane from Bank of America, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just drill in a little bit more on North America. James, I think on the last earnings call you talked a little bit about channel shift, like on-premise or food service maybe growing faster than some of the take-home channels. There were some commentary I think also about or observations I should say about maybe low-income consumers. Just stated things there.\nJohn, if you can also clarify, I think in the press release there was mention in the description around price mix, some sort of adjustment. Wasn't sure if that's an accrual related to promotions or just if you could just give us a little bit more color on that as well. Also sounds like concentrate shipments might have lagged in the quarter, so do we make that up in Q1? I know there's a lot there, but if you guys can just fill in, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, let me take the end and then I'll pass it over to James for the beginning. The mix that you refer to is timing-related, and it's not unusual in the fourth quarter to have timing-related items in the deductions area, particularly that will flow back through into next year.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, consumer. Let me go with two things. One, clearly the consumer landscape in North America. One has to not think of it in aggregate because actually in aggregate the U.S. consumer spending power has held up pretty strongly compared to some other developed markets. What has been important is to understand there's a section of the population that has come under pressure from disposable income, the real spending power squeeze from the inflationary effect. They're very much focused on affordability. You could perhaps argue that some of them went out less.\nThere was more at home purchases, some of the certain channels, and there we really focused with affordability both from individual pack size, and with multipack. On the other hand, there's a segment of consumers that still has plenty of money, plenty of purchasing power, and we've seen strong growth for some of the higher price point premium segments like fairlife, Core Power, Simply, some of those ones. There's clearly multiple things going on in the landscape in terms of categories and price points. We've been working to address both ends of those.\nAs it relates to channels, I think we've seen the renormalization. There has been a historic slight shift in volume consumption from at home to away over time. Clearly through COVID there was a big down in the away-from-home. Then a rebound in 2021, the away-from-home channels. In 2022, they continue to outpace at-home.\nIn 2023, they were slightly ahead of at-home. If you look at the various away-from-home channels, they were slightly ahead of at-home. I would say that that's landing more in what it was previous to COVID, the more normal situation. That was what I would say. Strong need to focus on the different consumer segments and renormalization of some of the channel dynamics.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning. Two questions if I could, I know I'm supposed to have one, but one's quick. If you could clarify, maybe for John, you call out the 2-3% currency headwind for next year on the revenue, but a 4-5% headwind on EPS. Just if you could, how much of that incremental bottom line headwind is going to show up in operating profit versus below the line given monetary asset revaluation, etc.?\nThe broader question is just thinking about all the refranchising activity and the system progress that you made in 2023. We talked about the financial impacts of that in 2024, but I'd love your perspective, James, on the importance of the steps you made in 2023 in terms of just betterment of the system overall and priorities going forward from a system evolution perspective. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nShall I start at this time and then you go second, John?\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nWe have been focused on our refranchising effort, and as I like John's phrase, our ambition is to be the world's smallest bottler. It still remains absolutely true, but we're going to do it at the pace to make sure we do the refranchising in the right way with the right partners. I think we can categorically say we're very pleased with the refranchising process that we have undertaken over the last number of years.\nAlmost without exception, every time we put one of the bottling companies into the hands of the right partner with a joint vision and investment plan to take the business forward, we have stepped up performance, whether it be a straight refranchising or a combination creating new bottlers or evolved bottlers, we have upped the level of performance. I think that is a sign of the commitment of the company to invest in what it does best, which is the branding, the marketing, the innovation, working with our bottlers to get the revenue growth management, and their unwavering commitment to drive execution and build capabilities and capacities in the marketplace.\nThat has helped power the overall performance I talked about in the answer to the previous questions. I think we're in the penultimate chapter of the refranchising. There's only really a couple of pieces left. At the right time with the right partners, we would like to finish the play. Really we have our eye on the prize, on creating a much stronger system together with our bottling partners to continue the top of the algorithm momentum very far into the future.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGreat. On currency Steve, let me just make a couple of comments in case there are other questions out there on currency overall. First of all, I think it's important to highlight the 2024 guidance that we've given. It would be close to flat if we were to exclude those few hyperinflationary markets. It just reinforces the point we're making on that distortion that those few markets have. Secondly, with regard to your specific question, I do not have that breakdown today. There's just too many puts and takes, particularly in that below the operating income line as we go through the year, you got to do a monthly remeasurement on the balance sheet items.\nThat's just a calculation that I don't have the ability to predict with great detail. I just keep in mind that the overall impact I think is the one to focus on. In normal years, the multiplier is 1.5-2x. We would continue to assume that will be the case going forward but these hyperinflationary markets have a tendency to create that distortion that we've highlighted. We'll continue to provide guidance as we go through the year to make sure that everybody stays abreast of the latest developments.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRob Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. James, you made a very strong case that really over the last five years, if you X out the noise, you've delivered at roughly 5.5% top line growth, which puts you clearly in the top rankings of your other staples companies and that's great. In terms of both 2024 and looking forward, assuming a continuation of that, what can you do to both de-risk that in terms of the bottom line and enhance it in terms of the bottom line given the various macro variables?\nGiven that you've now de-levered to 1.7x, you've shown interest in buying back stock. Should we think of share buybacks as perhaps a greater part of the overall algorithm and value creation for shareholders going forward?Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThe de-risking, I think what I would say is, we've faced an extraordinary number of headwinds in the last five years and still delivered at the top end of the algorithm. Things will happen in the coming years, but there'll be tailwinds. I think really the argument about the all-weather is I cannot tell you what the future holds, but if you look at what we've managed to work through and deliver at the top end on the revenue and the momentum and the capabilities that we've built in the system, and actually if you look at the share and look at our long-term performance of also gaining share within the industry, I think you can see a head of steam builds up on momentum.\nAt the scale that we operate, it's a very compelling way to drive it forward. As that feeds down into the bottom line, obviously the mid-single digits USD EPS call for 2024 includes the disposal of two points of EPS from the bottling system. On an ongoing basis that's already six to seven. I think we can continue to drive some leverage from the top line to the bottom line in dollars, and that becomes a compelling compounder over time.\nAs it relates to cash, I think that you will see, we've put in a new non-GAAP metric somewhere in the ecosystem of the website, which just calls out what John was talking about, about the number of discrete items that are coming up over the next couple of years as it relates to transition tax, actually curiously tax on the M&A transactions. If you sell a bottler, the money you get disappears into one account, but the tax you pay goes into the free cash flow, curiously enough. There's a whole set of discrete items that make the free cash flow look odd for the next few years.\nIf you strip that out, you see that the earnings are flowing into free cash flow. The cash conversion on that adjusted basis remains very high and is likely to do so. In a normal world, clearly, as John said, we would continue to increase our dividend and we would have substantive additional cash to continue to invest in the business and consider potential share repurchases. The wrinkle in the cream, if you like, is our considerations of the IRS tax case and the impending appeal. As we go forward for the next few years, we like our strong balance sheet. We're mindful of the likelihood of launching the appeal in the second half.\nWe have incoming non-operating cash flows which, as John talked about, we used to buy some shares in fourth quarter. We're going to balance all these things, particularly in the next couple of years. We'll keep everyone updated, but I think the long-term perspective is that the cash generation will continue to be very strong. John, yeah, go on.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nJust one additional point. In addition to that unwavering commitment we have to the dividend that we talked about in the script. One of the lessons, I think, over the last couple of years is to be prepared to be more dynamic relative to your normal view of the individual components. As you know, our debt, our debt goal is to be 2-2.5x and we're at 1.7x. We think that's right for what we need going into 2024, 2025. We've taken up our CapEx for 2024 because it's the right thing to do to continue to build the growth foundations that we need in those parts of the business that need capacity.\nJust two examples. I think we will continue to demonstrate that as we go forward. The share repurchases in the back half of the year, again, was not something that we had necessarily considered at the start of the year, but we felt there was an opportunity with the Barker proceeds coming in to do so. We'll continue to take that approach as we enter this coming year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. I wanted to see if you could maybe frame the global away from home channel. I know you touched on it a little bit in response to Brian's question, but we've heard about obviously there's a lot of pricing power in that channel. There's been a lot of pricing. You're talking about a normalization from elevated levels back to a more normal channel distribution between at home and away from home. Can you maybe just give us a bit more granular perspective on what you're seeing by region and whether some of the strength that I think was occurring in Q4 has continued into this year? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure, Chris. I'll give it a go. I think that the headline is the commentary about North America to some extent applies everywhere else in the sense that clearly in COVID, there was the close downs, the reopening, big swings between away from home and at home. In 2022, it renormalized. I think overall in 2023 you see that again. You saw that in the U.S. where the away from home channels in aggregate were slightly ahead of the at home channels. You see that also in Europe or the EMEA segment. You see the at home slightly ahead, but it's only marginal. When you break it down, there's going to be the continuing structural growth of away from home, but it's only a small fraction.\nIf that's a lead in to a question about pricing and is there some ongoing likelihood of a big upside from channel mix, the short answer is no. If I were to take a proxy of immediate consumption packages and future consumption packages, because channel mix becomes very different as you get to different parts of the world, particularly the emerging markets, then the immediate consumption came much more into balance versus the future consumption in 2023 relative to 2022. That's not too surprising as we start to also think about affordability having been a strategy in 2023. That's a roundabout way of saying we're not expecting big mix effects from channel in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. James, can you comment a little bit about the U.S.? I understand obviously U.S. is not in terms of the volumes times; it's about 20%, but within your outlook for 2024, you quoted in Q4 that water, sports, coffee where negative or decelerating. What of that is mostly self-inflicted vis-à-vis what you're actually facing in terms of market share, and how much you expect that to be lingering into first half of 2024.\nJust a clarification to your comment now in terms of the shift into on-premise and back to your comments on price mix, out of the 9% that you got, if my math is correct, you got about 2% or 3% benefit from mix in 2023. Should we expect that to decelerate or with your efforts to do more mini cans and take that more broadly, is that still going to be the projected contribution for 2024? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. The comments on the 2% in the fourth quarter, that was related not to channel mix but to the rate, the way that deductions happen. This is often just an accounting treatment between the quarters within the year. It's not mix as you would think about it in terms of package mix, channel mix, or category mix. This is related to the big difference between gross and net revenue and so it's a distraction in the short-term. I would move past that one and, if you like, to me ignore that bit, focus instead on the underlying impact in 2023 of the non-hyperinflationary pricing, which was the kind of 3.5% which very much ran through 2023 and is inherent in what we're saying, roughly speaking for 2024.\nWe're expecting rate and mix, whether it's channel, category, geography, package, the things we were saying, which in 2023 is what we're expecting in 2024. Again, those are all largely normalized in 2023, so by inference, they're all largely normalized in 2024 as well, so you see a stability across channels, packages, etc.\nAs it relates more specifically to the U.S., yes, we did some de-prioritization of some of the bulk water categories. Some of the advanced hydration was the normalization or restabilization of the sports drinks category. I don't think there's an obvious or useful split between self-inflicted or proactive decisions versus things that were competitive. That's hard to tease apart.\nClearly, from a performance point of view, when we think about it in the U.S., yes, there was a fractional softening of the volume through the year, which I think goes back to the comment I made about the different consumer segments but if you step back and think about what was the overall impact of our marketing innovation, RGM, and execution with the bottlers, the answer is we won volume share in 2023 and we won value share in 2023.\nYeah, there's work to be done in the water category, advanced hydration, and, to a much lesser extent, in tea but the overall picture is strong growth in sparkling, particularly Coke and Sprite, good on smartwater, good on vitaminwater, good on Topo Chico, very good on fairlife, good overall win on both dimensions. That's the platform we'll be looking to drive in 2024.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Truist\n\nYeah, good morning.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nHey, Bill.\n\nBill Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Truist\n\nJust a question on the China consumer and both how it's progressed or how he or she has progressed over the past few months versus your expectations or just in general, and what you see spending power, and just getting back to normal consumption as we move into 2024.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Let me put it like 2023 started very strongly in China. We had invested very heavily behind Chinese New Year, and actually we had a very strong first quarter last year which is still the back end of the reopening. While we grew volumes for the rest and for the total of the year 2023 and revenues, it did soften for the last three quarters of the year in China. I think what we're going to see is a reverse of that in 2024. We've invested strongly again in Chinese New Year.\nThis year, we won't know the result for another few weeks net-net but we're expecting it to be a little slower in first quarter, especially given what we're cycling from last year, and then for the year to improve but not too hot and not too cold, if I can use that analogy. Yes, there's a little weakness in the economic system, but we expect things to get better. We tend directionally to get better through the year, and we're going to keep investing behind not just key moments in the year like Chinese New Year, but restoring more momentum to sparkling and really focusing on RGM and execution opportunities.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nEverybody, good morning. When we met in December, we talked a little bit about 2023. There's a bunch of testing and learning on innovation, and 2024 will be about scaling some of them. Both of you mentioned fairlife Core Power, it's a big brand now. Maybe just talk about the scaling of that capacity expansion, and then maybe what other brands we should be considering in that same context. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Firstly, we're going to continue to experiment and find lots of new things hopefully in 2024. It's certainly true as you say that fairlife has been on a roll and we have been driving that. I think it's had not one near double digit volume growth for as many years I can remember, plus faster double digits in revenue. Clearly as we've scaled that, we've needed to put down more capacity.\nWe have recently announced and begun the process of building a mega plant up in upstate New York and so capacity is tight in the fairlife business, and Core Power is also firing on all cylinders. We'll certainly talk about some of these at CAGNY when we'll lay out some of the backstory things like fairlife and particularly Core Power and how, you know, these brands and products have done a great job in driving from experimentation to scaling to challenging, and for example, in the case of Coparta leading.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping to pick up on your commentary in response to Brian and Andrea's question on the U.S. First, did performance in the quarter play out as you expected? You mentioned softening in the market in your response to Andrea, but was that in line with how you thought growth would evolve or was it a bit weaker than you would have anticipated? Looking ahead to 2024, I appreciate the commentary on expecting balanced growth at the total company level, but do you expect that balance to occur in North America as well? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company",
    "content2": "Yeah, I think it was at a macro level foreseeable that the market would get tighter through the course of 2023 as inflation ran ahead of wage growth. Therefore, yeah, it wasn't surprising that there were tightness, particularly for certain consumer segments. I think all things in due proportion, the growth in North America in the fourth quarter was basically the same as the growth in the full year. It was only very fractional differences. I think these are not big changes in trends but yeah, I think there was a little softening through 2023.\nI think we'll see that a bit in reverse as 2024 starts off, as consumers and you can see it in the confidence indicators for consumers; they're starting to feel like the money coming in is starting to contain and get ahead of the inflation. I think we'll see that improve through the year. Again, all in due proportion, they're not going to be big shifts in the volume growth rate in the U.S. business. In aggregate, we would expect to get more from price relative to volume for the U.S. to business.\nThe balance that I talk about between price and volume applies on a global basis. Clearly that's then made up of geographic portfolio mix. Places like the U.S., we'd expect to see stable or slightly increasing volume with decent pricing all the way over to places like India where clearly we're getting much more volume than price and having to invest significantly in capacity. Those two, take those two examples but that's true of the global portfolio. Blend it all together and that's where the balance comes from.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nDirector, Rothschild & Co Redburn\n\nYeah, hi James, John. Hope you're both well. I've got a question on sparkling, please where 2% volume growth in the quarter and the year, very strong, and I think in the 20 quarters since 2019 it's actually averaged 3% in those 20 quarters, so definitely not ex growth. I was just wondering what your perspective is on the category going forward. Maybe with the consumer weakening.\nIf you can just touch on the launch of Coca-Cola Spice. I don't think we've talked about that yet. What gives you the confidence of launching this just as a permanent launch rather than a limited edition Coca-Cola Creations launch? Who's the target consumer? Is it going after Gen Z? Is it there to help with Coke's meals strategy? Just any color on that would be useful, please.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Coke Spice, a bit like Coke Creations, not exactly, but is really aimed at increasing connectivity with Gen Z and the broader consumers. Driving engagement, driving reconsideration. It's part of a whole overall strategy that, as you say, we've been deploying for a good number of years that has really worked to reengage consumers with the Coke trademark, whether it's Coke Original, Coke Zero Sugar, or even Diet Coke to some extent.\nThe overall strategy of an upgraded approach to marketing the innovation, whether it's Coke Spice or some of the creations through the RGM and the execution, has allowed us to drive core growth across the global business, and actually by also increasing the focus on Fanta and Sprite, even organizationally splitting them out into two sub teams within the organization, has allowed us to bring more clarity and more focus onto Fanta and Sprite and to drive growth there too which has worked in Q4 2023 and as you say over the last five years.\nI know that sometimes, I would say that people think about the sparkling category just through the optic of the U.S. over the last 20 years, and I would invite you to look at the optics or everyone to look at the optics of the sparkling category globally over time. Actually, there you see that the category remains robust at a global level scale both in terms of volume and revenue growth. Of course we are not just the leaders but we're the share winners. We see if we do the right things for our brands we will be able to drive the category forward and benefit disproportionately from that growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director, HSBC\n\nYes, good morning, everyone. Thank you. Can you comment for us on the state of global independent bottlers CapEx or digital capabilities? We've seen a really robust Latin American digital investment over the last four or five years, but where else do you see a step up in digital marketing development capabilities like this? Can you comment on the U.S. in this area as well?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOn us what?\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director, HSBC\n\nOn the U.S. regarding digital bottling system investments.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Carlos, yeah, I think it's fair to say that the overall investment levels that you refer to in Latin America are pretty consistent across the world. One of the underlying tailwinds, I believe we have is the degree to which our system is sharing in the opportunity that's ahead and willing to increasingly invest ahead of the curve. I think that's that's happening across the global system.\nOne of the subsets of that, of course, is the degree to which digital in its many forms is playing a pivotal role to sustaining and indeed building advantage wherever we operate. We have CAGNY next week, and I think you'll hear more of that threaded through the conversation. We'll tee up there. Safe to say, I think CapEx levels are at the highest as a percentage of system revenue that I can remember. Within that, the appetite and willingness to invest ahead of the curve, particularly in digital, is also at a very high level.\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director, HSBC\n\nThank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGreat. Thanks very much, everyone. Just to summarize, we're proud of what we accomplished in 2023. We are winning in the marketplace. We're going to be maintaining agility and improving every aspect of how we do business across our total beverage portfolio. John and I look forward to discussing more with you all next week at CAGNY. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and joining us this morning. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on a listen-only mode until the formal question and answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with\nJames Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investor section of our company website at cocacolacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion, to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins.\nIn addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question.\nIf you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. In the Q3, we delivered strong top-line growth, comparable operating margin expansion, and earnings per share growth. Our strategy is working. These results continue our track record of consistent delivery. And given our year-to-date performance, we are raising both our top-line and bottom-line guidance.\nThis morning, I'll provide a brief update on the global consumer landscape. Then, I'll focus much of my time on business performance across the segments and discuss how we've been investing to further strengthen our capabilities to capture longer-term growth opportunities. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for full year 2023, and some early considerations for 2024. The global operating environment is always dynamic, and this quarter was no exception.\nSome markets improved sequentially, while others dealt with a variety of factors ranging from transitory weather conditions to ongoing inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and conflict. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, driven by positive volume, some pricing actions in the marketplace, and carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Volume grew 2% and sequentially improved each month in the quarter, with September being our strongest month. Our year-to-date volume growth remains consistent with underlying performance compared to 2019.\nOverall, our industry remains vibrant and is expanding, and we are executing to capture that growth. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Consumer sentiment continues to vary around the world. In developed markets, consumer spending in agre has held up quite well. However, some consumers feel pressured.\nWe've seen some shifts to discount channels and switching to private label brands in a few markets and categories. The intensity of this activity was largely the same across Europe compared to the previous quarter, but was less pronounced in the US, Australia, and Japan. In the developing and emerging markets, the picture is more mixed. We're seeing broadly consumer strength across Latin America, India, and in parts of Central and Southeast Asia. On the other hand, consumer confidence and spending has yet to fully recover in Africa and China. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities give us a distinct advantage, and we are leveraging these capabilities to ensure we have the right product in the right package, in the right channel, and at the right price point to meet consumers where they are.\nNotwithstanding the dynamics at play around the world, we have many levers to pull and continue to deliver through varying market conditions. I'll share some more details from each region. Starting with Asia-Pacific, we delivered organic revenue growth, but operating income declined primarily as a result of investing ahead of the curve to participate in longer-term opportunities and incurring additional costs from strategic portfolio rationalization. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew top-line and profit by linking our brands to drinking occasions coupled with strong execution.\nIn Thailand, we launched Coke Kitchen, which connected consumers to influencers who shared their favorite recipes with Coca-Cola. We also partnered with food service aggregators to drive combo meals. The campaign attracted nearly 1 million consumers, and we significantly increased the attachment rate of our beverages with meals ordered through food service aggregators. In Japan, we're gaining volume and value share year-to-date.\nWe continue to see strong momentum from our Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee, and I LOHAS campaigns and a stepped-up execution in vending, e-commerce, and convenience channels. However, in China, volume declined as the sparkling soft drinks category is taking longer to recover. Our results were also impacted by some strategic decisions to deprioritize lower-profit categories. Our focus is to restore momentum to the sparkling soft drink category and capitalize on revenue growth management and execution opportunities. In India, we delivered double-digit volume and top-line growth, which resulted in the highest value share gain over the past three years.\nWe're winning in the marketplace by generating 2.6 billion transactions at affordable price points and driving availability across rural regions. Across Asia-Pacific, as part of our world-without-waste strategy to help drive the circular economy for packaging materials, our system launched 100% recycled PET packaging in India, Indonesia, and Thailand.\nMoving on to EMEA, we delivered strong organic revenue and operating income growth. In Africa, macro conditions remain challenging, and our business was further impacted by natural disasters in Morocco and Libya. Despite this environment, we drove transaction growth to accelerated refillable PET expansion, digitizing nearly 100,000 outlets and adding 80,000 coolers year-to-date. In Europe, consumers are still facing pressure, and our business was unfavorably impacted by poor weather. Despite these dynamics, we gained value share through strong performance in sparkling soft drinks and tea. We did this by partnering with our system to drive value for key customers and our consumers.\nWe continue to see promising early results with Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in Europe. We are learning and expanding in alcohol-rated drinks, including our recent announcement about Absolut Vodka and Sprite.\nAnd last, in Eurasia and the Middle East, we recruited consumers through innovative occasion-based marketing and events like Fanta Fest Türkiye, which focused on snacking occasions with concerts by prominent local artists. They also launched a 100% recycled PET package this summer. In North America, we generated strong organic revenue growth and delivered margin expansion by executing across our total beverage portfolio. We continue to see away-from-home channels outperform at-home channels. Within sparkling soft drinks, elasticities are holding up well, and we continue to drive quality leadership with Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta. For example, our system stepped up in-store activation on Sprite Lymonade Legacy and with increased displays at point of sale, which drove higher household penetration and repeat purchases. Fanta drove nearly two points of value share gain year-to-date through innovations and new graphics, including the latest Halloween iteration of the What The Fanta platform.\nOutside of sparkling, BodyArmor and Powerade trends are stabilizing, and fairlife Core Power, smartwater, and Gold Peak generated value share gains. In the US, to protect water resources, we renewed a decade-long partnership with the Department of Agriculture to restore and improve watersheds in national forests and grasslands. Water is a critical priority for our system and the communities that we serve. In Latin America, we generated double-digit top-line and profit growth by executing on all facets of our strategy, which resulted in value share gains in four of our top five markets. In the fifth market, Mexico, we're seeing improving value share trends over the last few months. We're increasingly linking our brands to consumers' passion points to build deeper connections.\nIn Brazil, through Coke Studio, we partnered with the Town Music Festival, where we hosted 60 hours of concerts and engaged with artists and influencers, which generated 1 billion impressions and reached nearly 50 million consumers. We continue to drive affordability through refillable packaging and larger PET packages. In developing and emerging markets, refillables are an important tool to both eliminate waste and offer products at lower price points. Last, our system stepped up availability, replacing over 270,000 coolers year-to-date, which increased our share of visible inventory in key outlets. Global ventures generated strong overall growth. At Costco, we strengthened our revenue growth management equation while driving transaction growth. This was supported by strong innovation and marketing campaigns such as our global summer of ice, expansion of the refreshment category, and the introduction of our personalized free drop loyalty activation in the UK.\nAdditionally, Innocent gained value share in both the UK and France. Finally, Bottling Investments Group improved organic revenue and operating income through expanding affordable immediate consumption entry packs and progressing towards strengthening route-to-market and optimizing trade promotions. At the same time, we're working towards decarbonizing our operations in India through using 200 electric vehicles, with plans to add more before the end of 2023. Beyond the quarter, we continue to have confidence in the long term. We see momentum continuing across our industry, and our system is galvanized more than ever to capture this opportunity. Leveraging data to drive better decision-making is key to improving execution. Our system has collectively invested in digital initiatives to drive on all facets of our strategy. Starting first with marketing and innovation. Our marketing transformation is increasingly making our brands more relevant to consumers.\nToday, Gen Z spends seven to nine hours per day on screens. However, very little time is spent watching traditional TV. We've been shifting our media spend towards digital. In 2019, digital was less than 30% of our total media spend, and year-to-date it's over 60%. Through digital campaigns, we're segmenting the population and disproportionately reaching consumers where we earn higher returns on investment. We've seen tremendous engagement through digital-first campaigns for Coca Meals, Sprite's Heat Happens, and Fuze Tea's Made of Fusion, among others. We're taking bold steps to be at the forefront of both consumer and non-consumer-facing generative AI. For example, we launched Create Real Magic, which turned consumers into digital creators. We also brought Gen AI into our creative process for the award-winning Coca-Cola Masterpiece film and later gave fans the chance to collect a piece of this work through the sale of NFTs.\nRecently, we launched Coke Y3000, which is our eighth iteration in the Coke Creations platform. Coca-Cola Y3000 is the world's first futuristic flavor co-created with AI. The launch has demonstrated strong initial results. On the non-consumer-facing side, we're implementing generative AI to improve access to insights, market data, research, and trends. Moving on to revenue growth management and integrated execution. As a system, we're accelerating eB2B platforms that allow for better tailoring of product price and packaging architecture, reducing out-of-stock and optimizing placement of visible inventory. Year-to-date, we've connected 6.9 million customers to eB2B platforms. We're continuing to expand coverage and offer customer personalization at scale. Initial pilots suggest that customers who receive AI-written push notifications can be more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, resulting in incremental retail sales.\nWe're just scratching the surface of what's possible, but we're investing in digital capabilities now to expand our potential down the road. To sum it all up, we're encouraged by our results year-to-date, and this is reflected in our updated 2023 guidance. We have many levers to pull and have proven that we can deliver in many types of markets around the world. We continue to win on a local level, maintain flexibility on a global level, and reinvest to build our system for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJhon Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and highlight our updated 2023 guidance. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2024 and the actions we are taking to continue to deliver on our objectives. As James mentioned, we delivered strong Q3 results.\nStarting with the top line, we grew organic revenues 11%. Unit case growth was 2%. If you exclude the impact of suspending our business in Russia, we have delivered positive volume growth in each quarter since the start of 2021. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Price mix growth was 9%, driven by pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets, along with carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points for the quarter.\nThis was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, Q3 comparable EPS of $0.74 was up 7% year-over-year, despite higher-than-expected 4% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $7.9 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment and $230 million in M&A-related payments. Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.5x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. Recently, we entered into a letter of intent to refranchise our Philippines bottler. As we progress on our refranchising journey, we aspire to improve the return profile of our business.\nIn 2015, when Bottling Investments Group was more than 50% of our net revenue, our return on invested capital was approximately 17%. Today, Bottling Investments Group makes up less than 20% of net revenue, and our return on invested capital is over 23%, nearly a seven-point increase. After this transaction closes, our remaining assets in the Bottling Investments Group will include operations in India, Africa, and several smaller locations, primarily in Asia-Pacific. We will remain disciplined in our refranchising approach by making sure we best position our system to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our business performance year-to-date gives us confidence that we can deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 10% to 11%, which will be led by price mix and includes positive volume growth.\nWe do expect pricing in developed markets to moderate in the fourth quarter as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. There are also a few hyperinflationary markets that will continue to drive price mix. There will be one additional day in the Q4. We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be an approximate four-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate six-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We now expect our underlying effective tax rate for 2023 to be 19%.\nAll in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. This guidance does not include any payments related to our US income tax disputes with the IRS, which are unlikely to occur in 2023. Given the momentum of our business, the strength of our balance sheet, and some proceeds that we expect to receive from bottler refranchising, we have increased flexibility to continue to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders. While it is too early to provide specific guidance on 2024, we want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our top-line momentum across the majority of our markets.\nThere are a handful of hyperinflationary markets where it is either not possible to hedge or it is costly to do so. In these markets, we've demonstrated that we can manage currency pressures by taking price with local market inflation, and we will continue to follow this approach. While some commodities are normalizing, we also have input costs that could be impacted by tensions and conflicts. With respect to advertising spend, our bias is to continue to reinvest behind our brands while maintaining flexibility. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Of course, several factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business outlook between now and February.\nOver the past few years, we've delivered USD EPS growth, and we have many levers to continue to do so. So, in summary, we are encouraged by our business results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments over the long term. Thanks to the incredible commitment of our system employees around the world, we're very clear on the direction we are heading and well-equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. We continue to invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. We remain focused on capturing the opportunities available to us. With that, Operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press Star 1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press Star 1 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question.\nIf you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nMD at Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. So, clearly, another strong set of results in Q3 and obviously increased confidence for the year with the full-year raise. I'd love to sort of get a bit more perspective on 2024. I know you won't want to put specific numbers around the outlook, but we're just hoping you can give us a sense for how you think about the pricing outlook for next year?, given the strength in Q3, and perhaps break that down into the price increase versus mix versus hyperinflationary market pieces of it and what the competitive environment sort of portends for next year on the pricing front? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nLet me just offer up a few thoughts, Dara.\nFirstly, just breaking out Q3, because I think that's instructive as you think about the downhead of the year and into next year. Firstly, there's a couple of points in Q3. There's the carryover from the more inflationary environment from 2022, and obviously, that'll drop out as we get into Q4 and obviously next year. Then you've got the regular pricing, and then you've got a couple of points of pricing that's coming from these very high inflation markets, Argentina, Turkey, and a number of the African markets that, given the levels of inflation, is making a difference at the overall company level. As John mentioned in the FX guidance, we're assuming some degree of negativity from those markets next year, but we're assuming some degree of positivity in that sense in price mix next year.\nThe one thing that's uncertain about, well, the one thing that's certain about high inflation markets is it ends unpredictably. So it's very early to have a full pitch on what that's going to look like in 2024, and obviously, we'll update when we get to February. So net-net, you're going to have continued moderation heading towards the landing zone in the developed economies. You've got a couple of emerging markets which are sub-normal inflation, a.k.a. China, and then you've got a mixed bag of emerging markets, and of particular importance is going to be what is the overall journey in these high inflation marketplaces. So hopefully, that provides some parameters with which to think about how it lands in Q4 and into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nMD, Barclays\n\nSo one of the things that struck me as really interesting is in the release, when you specifically, first of all, it was helpful that you called out the specific contribution from inflationary pricing. But one thing I thought was interesting is the regions where there was greater inflationary pricing were also the regions where there was, at least versus my expectations, better-than-expected unit case volume. So I think historically, right, the logic and the elasticity would say more pricing, less volume, but here you're getting that unit case volume to come through. So I just wondered if you could talk a little bit maybe about what you're doing differently that's enabling that kind of combination. And then also, if you're able to speak to transaction growth in those markets also, if that's pacing, how that's pacing relative to unit cases? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nSo, firstly, I wanted to just underline that we have been pursuing for a good number of years, but very specifically this year and also will be pursuing into next year: no matter what the degree of inflation in the environment, we want to protect the scale of our consumer franchise and see it grow. In other words, we want to see positive volume or transaction growth in the environment. And so very much our strategy of the marketing, the innovation, the RGM, the execution has been very much around not just gaining value share in these environments but making sure that there's volume growth embedded in it. So we very much take that approach. And as it relates to the regions where there was inflation, where there's volume, I mean, the two biggest pieces of the puzzle are Latin America and EMEA.\nAnd taking those in order, Latin America, the inflationary pricing is very clearly driven by Argentina. The rest of the continent, generally speaking, is in the same sort of ballpark that inflation that has been predominant there for an extended period of time. And it's an environment we very much know how to operate in, and we have a great business there, and they very much are masters of executing against the marketing innovation, the execution, and the RGM. And then Argentina is a roller coaster given its inflation levels and its economic levels. I can say that from personal experience as I was the country manager there in 2001 and 2002 when they had a big devaluation and default on their debt. And so this is something where we know how to operate, and it's kind of part of what happens in certain markets in Latin America.\nAnd so we are able to execute. As it relates to EMEA, divided into two parts. One is the European environment where inflation, much like the US, is moderating down, and the dynamic in Europe was much more around a moderating degree of inflation and the fact that they had a relatively poor summer in terms of the weather and that consumer is perhaps under a little more pressure than the US. The other half of the EMEA group is Eurasia and Africa. And in that context, there are a number of very high inflation marketplaces like Turkey, Zimbabwe, as it happens, Nigeria to some extent, Egypt to some extent. And there, when the inflation does spike, you do occasionally see impacts to volume. But overall, we've been able to manage through it so that on a total segment basis, we've carried it through.\nWe certainly look to, as I said, maintain and grow the consumer franchise, although in some of those markets, in any given quarter, the volume may be negative as inflation tends to be much more spiky than persistent.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nMD, Golden Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your marketing investments. They were up, and I guess a drag on operating margins in the quarter. Just hoping for some more color on these reinvestments. Then, James, you mentioned your plans to continue to invest ahead of the curve.\nSo, could you provide a little more color on how you're thinking about this and then ultimately how much of the top-line strength you plan to reinvest in the marketing, whether it's this year and then, more importantly, how you're thinking about this next year, especially in the context of greater FX headwinds? I guess trying to understand how flexible you're going to be to balance these reinvestments with driving dollar EPS growth. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOkay. Hi, everyone. Kind of let me try and unpack that a little bit. So we have come in post-COVID over the last couple of years and said we expected a rebound, and we are going to lean in and invest for growth as long as growth is there rather than trying to pull back in anticipation of something.\nThat modus operandi, I'm not sure I would characterize extra marketing as a drag on results, more as a motor to driving the top line and the bottom line that we're seeing. So we feel that the leaning in is working, obviously typified by the fact we've raised both the top line and the bottom line guidance. I think as a model, to the extent that we can continue to push that through the end of this year and into next year, we would certainly be happy to do so. Having said that, to the extent that 2024 brings some unexpected surprises, we will pivot, whether it's a country, a region, or globally, we will pivot with speed as we did in Q2 2020 when COVID hit, and we ramped down marketing spend in that environment.\nSo we feel we've developed a much greater degree of flexibility to move, should moving be needed, at whatever part of the world. But as a starting point, we're going to lean in for growth. I think the last thing I would say is if you think about the balance of all these items, if you kind of zoom out a little bit and take a broader perspective of the operating income margin, because obviously marketing is just a component of all the different pieces, if you take a look at operating income margin over the last five years or so, you'll see that it's been increasing at about half a point a year operating margin, which is broadly in line with implied leverage in the long-term growth model. So that has been an objective of ours.\nIt's not going to happen every quarter because quarters are very lumpy, but it is part of the way we see our strategy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director at Equity, Evercover ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. James, in the past, the Coca-Cola Company has talked about moving the consumer from more commodity packs to more of the, I think you called them incident packs or the higher value-added packs. I'd love to get a sense, and maybe we just focus on the US, of where you are in that journey, how much room there is to improve mix. And is this something that you can do in a weaker economic environment where the consumer is also looking for more affordability and value options? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Thanks, Robert.\nLook, I absolutely think there's a tremendous opportunity in the US marketplace to leverage greater pack diversity. We're not capturing all the opportunities that are there. The leveraging of greater pack diversity actually helps in an environment where, as you have in the US at the moment, where certain segments of consumers feel under disposable income pressure and would look for more affordable options. And yet there are plenty of segments, either in terms of their income or in terms of the channels they're going and spending in, who are more disposed for premium options. The marketplace offers the opportunity of greater segmentation and diversity of packaging. We have more that we can do in the marketplace in the US, whether it be on the nature and the range of the can sizes and shapes or the PET bottles.\nSo I think there's plenty of runway in the US to continue to leverage packaging diversity to satisfy consumer needs and to deliver on the RGM equations that we have the opportunity for in the US. And ultimately, you could look at other parts of the world, Latin America or Europe, which are relatively developed cold markets, and see that we do successfully use more packages there to deliver the business that the consumers want to have.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nMD US Beverages, Household Products & Personal Care Equity Research, JP Morgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. So, John, I appreciate your commentary about the EPS growth in 2024. And James, you said you would like to see volume growth, which is obviously encouraging and in line with what you said in the last Earnings Call.\nBut given the many moving pieces recently and the weaker consumer in developed markets, number one, is there anything that changed your thoughts sequentially? And two, related to the 80% of the volumes, of course, being abroad, and granted that obviously is moving the impact of the GLP drugs, I think it would be dismissive not to ask given investor concerns. Can you talk about how you're proactively approaching this potential risk? Obviously, it's similar to what you have done over the many, many years in terms of the sugar content and portion control, but just curious how investors should be thinking of the tools you have at your disposal? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Andrea.\n\nJhon Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSo on the first point, if you think about 2023 and where we were 12 months ago and what we're guiding to for the rest of this year, it's in an environment that has had the same kinds of forex headwinds and much of the volatility that I would expect to continue into the next 12 months or so. And we've demonstrated, as we've both highlighted both in the script and in a number of forums, the levers that we have developed over the last few years to effectively manage through a period with such volatility and uncertainty. And I expect 2024 to be a similar type of year. So I would point you to many of these levers: improved marketing and innovation, the revenue growth management abilities that I think year on year are getting stronger, and the overall execution of our system in the marketplace.\nSo the industry continues to be strong, and we expect that to be a feature of our underlying equation for 2024 also. Regarding the second point you raised, it is an area that we are very focused on. There's still a lot of views out there as to what impact, if any, it will have. I would offer, if you'd step above it and look at the thrust of our total beverage strategy over the last few years, that we are well positioned to provide choice and to provide options for people's respective motivations and needs. And so we'll continue to monitor this space, but we're confident that the total beverage strategy, 68% of our products have low or no calories today. And we continue to invest in innovation and choice to deal with whatever comes at us.\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey (Wells Fargo Securities\n\nSenior Equity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research\n\nHi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question about Coca-Cola Zero. Growth has decelerated a bit through the year against pretty exceptional unit case growth last year. So I was just wondering if you could reframe where we are with the franchise, the opportunities you see forward, and if we're perhaps reaching any thresholds just with the expansion of the offering. Thanks so much.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure, Chris. I don't think we're reaching a threshold in terms of the expansion of Coke Zero. Actually, I think quite the opposite. I think there's a vast potential for Coke Zero going forward. I think what you see in the very short term is the impact of some of the big Coke Zero markets, a.k.a. Europe.\nThey also had a very poor summer and run for a couple of months there, and that makes it look like it's dipped down in Q3. But I think Coke Zero has plenty of runway going forward, and we will continue to invest behind it and are bullish on its long-term potential.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just a little bit on China and, I guess, to some extent, Africa. Can you maybe - this is obviously not the first we've heard of the consumer being a little bit slow to bounce back - but is there anything Coca-Cola can do to accelerate that in terms of pricing or promotion, or is it really just waiting on the market?\nDid you see any real changes in that consumer as the quarter progressed, where you ended the quarter with maybe a little more green shoots that things are getting better as we go into the fourth? Thanks.\n\nJhon Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure, Bill. Obviously, I hate the idea of just waiting for something to happen macroeconomically. Certainly, it helps when there's tailwind from the general environment, but we're not going to wait for that. We're very focused on investing to try and capitalize on the opportunities and restore momentum, particularly on the sparkling business. And there's a lot of RGM and execution opportunities for us to go and tackle in China. Also, we need to get cranked up and have a really strong Chinese New Year, which will be in the early part of 2024.\nAnd we took a set of decisions in Q3, which created a bit of an impact on the APAC segment margin to really get focused and kind of invest ahead and make some prioritization decisions so that we can really drive the Chinese business forward, hoping that there'll be a plus from the tailwinds of the macroeconomics, but we can't wait for that. We need to focus on controlling what we can control and investing to drive the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nDirector Consumer Staples, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi, James and John. Hope you're both well. I've got a question on BIG and the Philippines. And James, maybe you can just talk about the Philippines, high level, how the country performed. And I guess from a transaction, why now and why CCP?\nAnd then, John, can you maybe just give some thoughts on what the transaction could mean for FY24 outlook if it does go ahead, maybe the sales margin, EPS, and then maybe just comment when you said a portion of proceeds from non-operating activities may go towards buybacks. Should we read that as BIG disposals? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Let me start there, Charlie. We have a clear stated objective that we want to be the world's smallest bottler. And so over time, have been refranchising the operations. We currently hold basically four pieces: the Philippines, a large stake in CCBI, a significant part of the system in India, and then a small number of other countries, about a quarter in each, in rough terms. And so we are long-term refranchisers of the bottling operations we own.\nIn terms of the Philippines, we've had actually a good set of recent years in the Philippines, a good bounce back. Now we're seeing some ups and downs given availability, or better said, lack of availability of some critical commodities in the marketplace. But actually, overall, we've had a very good run the last number of years. And so we've been looking for the right time and the right partners to refranchise to. I think most importantly, this is a combination of a strong local long-term investing family, the Aboitiz Group, together with some system expertise coming from CCEP. So, I think it's the right combination of partners that can bring bottling expertise and knowledge of the Philippine market, Philippines market together to continue the track record of what's been achieved. John, do you want to do the other pieces?\n\nJhon Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah.\nSo on the transaction itself, Charlie, we'll guide in February, assuming that the deal closes. We're making great progress on that at the moment. Without giving specifics, as you will know from history, it'll have a revenue headwind and a margin tailwind. On specifics, we'll give more details in February. With regard to the last part of the long question, I would say the following: one, we have, I think, developed a strong position and created flexibility given the momentum we have in the business, the stronger balance sheet we have today versus a few years back, and the fact that we do have proceeds coming in from non-operating sources, i.e., the bottler refranchising primarily. We continue to be very focused on reinvesting in the business and returning capital.\nAs we look at some of these proceeds coming in, we'll evaluate their best use, including share repurchases beyond the current objective we have to cover dilution. More to come on that in February.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I had one just clarification and then a question. The clarification is, did you give us how much hyperinflationary pricing affected just the total price mix at the total company level?\n\nJhon Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nNo, we didn't give a precise number, but it's about two and a half points. Depends which countries you want to add in, and where you want to cut the line. But think of it as about two and a half points in Q3.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Thank you. Then my question is just about North America.\nI think in the press release, unit case volumes were flat, and you called out that you had gained share. And then, James, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about away from home growing faster than at home. So can you just sort of give us a little bit more perspective on kind of what's happening in North America in terms of both the relative channel performance, anything you may be seeing in terms of value-seeking behavior with consumers? Just trying to get a better understanding of kind of how your business performed and just kind of what's happening with the category as we got through the quarter.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Firstly, let me start by saying the Nielsen universe represents just under half of our business in the US. So the measured channels are just under half of the total business.\nWhat's happening in the consumer landscape is, in kind of simplifying it down, the lower-income consumers are those most under pressure, and the shopping occasion that's most under pressure is when they're buying for at home. So that is the bit that's most captured by Nielsen. The bit of the marketplace where there's more growth is when consumers are away from home. So there's still a rebound and strong growth in away-from-home channels, not just some of the restaurants, but the amusements, travel, leisure, hospitality, and those things. You're seeing more growth in that part of the marketplace, which is unmeasured. So that's what's really driving the strength of the US business overall and the revenue side. You see kind of a divergence of the consumer behavior between at home and away from home. Obviously, who's under pressure from a disposable income is clear.\nAnd then that feeds through into kind of the observed measures channels versus the total overall marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Operator. And good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So I kind of wanted to follow up on Bryan's question there. I mean, James, you mentioned trade down to private label and discount channels in your prepared remarks. But I think you also mentioned that relative to Q2, the impact was similar in Europe, but actually less pronounced in the markets like the US, Australia, and Japan. So I would love just to get your perspective on why you think it was less pronounced in those markets? And then as you look out to Q4 and 2024, how do you kind of see this trade-down dynamic evolving? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOkay.\nSo I think, look, the European consumer is under slightly more pressure than the US consumer from a disposable income point of view. That's the starting point. So I think that's why you see a little more trading down or tightness on basket size in Europe versus the US. And I think that's generally overall true. And then the question of which categories are most pressured by that is really about brand strength and prioritization of occasions by the consumer. So if you're going to save money, you don't trade down averagely across everything. You make a choice in certain categories, and you preserve your choices on other categories.\nSo very much our objective is to make sure they value our brand so that as they make the choices in the shopping occasion, if there is going to be a reduction in total spend, that obviously happens in some other categories when they trade down to the private label in those ones, and we preserve our brand strengths because we deliver value for them in the product, in the marketing, in the innovation. And so that's the overall dynamic as we see it, and that's the difference between the US and Europe.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, guys. A question on the Asia-Pacific business. James, you mentioned that the India business was very solid, but China was weak.\nFirst, maybe you can give a comment on how big of a drag China was in the quarter and what are your expectations going forward into next year?. Then from a price mix standpoint, price mix of 1% in the segment was one of the lowest across your other segments. I know there's probably some geographic mix input, but can you talk about the pricing environment as well in Asia-Pacific. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Yeah. I mean, China was clearly a drag in volumetric terms on the segment. Most importantly, from a margin point of view, it's really important to not over-rotate to the numbers in any given quarter, given the lumpiness of this is concentrate sales, several steps back in the supply chain from the consumer. So I think it's important to always take an average of four quarters.\nIn Q3, as I commented a little earlier, we made a number of decisions on portfolio prioritization as it related to China and to investing for a fast start in 2024 in a number of markets in Asia-Pacific, whether that be Japan or China. So there are some investments going there. The overall pricing environment is relatively clear. China inflation is relatively minimal. In Japan, we've been taking pricing recently, given the inflation in Japan, which is kind of very different to the last 30 years. Then the rest of the inflation is kind of the relatively obvious CPI around the rest of ASEAN and Australia. So that's really what's driving it. I think see Q3 in Asia-Pacific more as an anomaly in terms of price mix rather than a trend.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead.Your line is open.\nYes. Good morning, everyone. Can you speak to the sort of digital investments that the US bottlers are doing and that you're helping them with? Is it more revenue-driven or perhaps more efficiency, cost, supply chain-centric? I guess in somewhat I'm trying to understand is how are digital investments changing these US bottlers and their capabilities?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nWhat was the last bit of the question, Carlos?\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director and Head of Global Beverage Research and Latin America Food Analyst, HSBC\n\nHow are these digital investments changing these bottlers and their capabilities?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. I mean, the US bottlers, much like the rest of the international bottlers, are undergoing a set of digital investments. And actually, it's both. The answer is not either. It's both.\nWe have been making investments in technology for a long period of time to drive efficiencies through the supply chain, through the manufacturing, through logistics, whether it be old-school technology investments, AI, and now Generative AI is kind of a different feature. So there's a lot going on, and there's a lot of connectivity among the bottlers on the enterprise software side because they're all connected through. They basically all use, or most of them use, a shared platform to get things done that's referred to internally as Kona. So there's a lot of investment on making sure the supply chain is as efficient as it can be and a lot of support from ecosystem partners to get it done. And then in terms of the rest of it, I mean, they're investing in the marketplace to digitize the relationship with largely the non-modern trade.\nObviously, when you're talking to the big modern retail customers, that interaction is already largely digitized, and the focus there is on trying to intensify the connection really from a supply chain inventory visibility and forecasting effectiveness point of view, but the connectivity already exists. And then from the non-chain customers, it's really about can you get them onto in simple terms a B2B platform so that it's 24/7 opportunities to order, knowing that if you can digitize the relationship, then it tends to be deeper and more productive. And then once that exists, layering on an AI component, which a number of the bottlers internationally have been working on in coordination, an AI-supported kind of B2B relationship over a platform that can then provide them suggested purchase orders, and that is also helping to drive the business.\nSo the US bottlers in that sense are very much on a similar journey to the international bottlers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrett Cooper\n\nManaging Partner, Consumer Edge",
    "content2": "Thank you. Not necessarily looking at the Q3 or year-to-date results, but looking over many years, Coke's growth in sparkling and non-sparkling hasn't been meaningfully different, whereas there would seem to be a higher growth opportunity in non-sparkling given just the differential in market share that you hold in the implementation of category cluster management. So can you speak to any impediments to higher growth in non-sparkling or what I might be missing? And then as I guess a part B is just within that umbrella, can you talk about your ability to develop newer categories to the company like hot coffee or alcohol? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nOur objective is to do justice to the brands in the portfolio. Certainly, you can make an argument that those categories where we have lower shares have a natural opportunity to gain share. But of course, that is something you need to take from someone else. The other way of seeing the world is to say that the beverage industry, seen from a global perspective, I reference back to the page in CAGNY with all the little people on it. The vast majority of the page is actually white space. In other words, the beverage industry is not yet created. And so actually, the idea that sparkling continues to grow is a representation of us operating from a position of strength to create the industry in the white spaces with our most successful and strongest brands.\nContinued growth of sparkling should be a feature of our path going forward. Then in the non-sparkling categories, of course, we are looking to gain share. We've talked historically about trying to get from experimenter to challenger to leader to quality leadership. I think that is a long-term build that has been playing out. If you take the long-term perspective and look at the percent of the total business that is made up of non-sparkling brands, it has increased slowly, but it has increased consistently over the last couple of decades. We start from a point of view of being consumer-centric, from resource and capital allocation, and from earning the right to move up the experimenters into the challenger, into the leadership position.\nNothing radical is going to happen overnight, but it is a dynamic that has built steadily over the last number of years and decades. We're confident in the opportunity to rebuild the industry or to build the industry further into the future.\n\nJhon Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nOkay. That was the last question, Operator. Okay. So to conclude, thanks very much, everyone. We've proven, I hope you can see, in Q3 that we can continue to deliver volume, top-line growth, and incremental US dollar earnings per share by executing against our all-weather strategy. We're confident that we can create value over the long term. So thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question and answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe've posted schedules under financial information in the investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executive during this morning's discussion, to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release, and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the Q2. Our combination of strong loved brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today.\nTo give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I'll start by discussing Q2 performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I'll highlight our performance across categories including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio. Finally, I'll touch on why we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives and then John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023.\nIn Q2, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished, and energy prices continued to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated, and geopolitical tensions continue to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Volume was flat, and after a slower start, it sequentially improved, with June being our strongest month in the quarter.\nIn the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong, and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value, and we continue to gain share. During the quarter, we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. As we look towards the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate, and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continue to be relatively low. However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories across the sector. Consumers are increasingly cost conscious. They're looking for value and stocking up on items on sale.\nIn these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It's more important than ever to be consumer centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions which deliver value value through basket and incidence growth. In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it's equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation which helps offset the currency pressures.\nThere are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in Q2 and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels and we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavorably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter. However, the growth outlook remains intact.\nIn a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs. Our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments, and we remain consumer-centric and focused on growth. Our recipe for success is unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategy. Through a combination of world-class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management, and strong execution, we are raising the bar in increasing quality leadership across our portfolio. Starting with Coca-Cola, we are growing our base of Gen Z drinkers, gaining share, and leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies across our system.\nDuring the quarter, we gained volume and value share by linking Coca-Cola to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. A great example is a Recipe for Magic which was activated in more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe-focused billboards. The Coca Meals campaign also allows Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance. For instance, in the Away-From-Home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with pizza, the number one consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year, from 10%-20 over the past four years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price-pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization.\nDuring Q2, we grew basket incidence and volume per trip by double digits while increasing price per liter.\nMoving on to sparkling flavors, we are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our staple brands, which includes Sprite, Fanta, Fresca, and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets.\nWith Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global Heat Happens platform. In North America, Sprite celebrated hip-hop's 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concert tours, exclusive experiences, and collaborations with prominent artists. We partner with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our global Sprite Limelight music program for Gen Z drinkers across 1,500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite Waterbomb festival similarly generated strong results.\nIn India, the Joke in a Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat. In June, Sprite was awarded Most Resilient Brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand.\nTurning to Water, Sports, Coffee and Tea, we are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities, prioritized markets and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investments. We are building our edge through consumer centricity by accelerating the speed to market our innovation, measuring results in real time, and scaling successes. We continue to build excitement for Fuze Tea through the rollout of Green Tea in Mexico, Summer limited edition in Turkey, and expansion of zero sugar offerings across Europe. Early results show promising velocities, and Fuze Tea grew volume double digits during the quarter. vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched vitaminwater Zero in North America with a new sweetener system of monk fruit and stevia, which generated value share gains.\nWe are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast growing subsegment within sports drinks with the launch of BodyArmor Flash I.V. in the US and Flashlyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results.\nOur juice value-added dairy and plant-based beverages have delivered nine consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark. Simply Mixology, which provides consumers with great-tasting mixers and ready-to-drink mocktails, kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer, and its national rollout. Also, Fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and Fairlife Nutrition Plan continued their strong momentum. In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth.\nFinally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results. In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start, and these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet.\nAs we strive to grow our business, we continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the US we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables. We recently kicked off a program with customers in four US cities to test refillable fountain cups, with plans to expand elsewhere.\nWe successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. Now, instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum, 2, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel, and 3, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives thanks to our incredible system employees around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong Q2 results. Starting with the top line, we grew organic revenues 11%.\nUnit cases were flat as James said. Volume for the Q2 got off to a slower start but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price mix growth was 10% for the quarter, driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency.\nComparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds.\nPutting it all together, Q2 comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year over year despite higher than expected 6% currency headwinds.\nFree cash flow was approximately $4 billion year to date.\nThis was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during Q2 as well as M&A-related payments.\nOur balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2-2.5x.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth.\nAs James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace.\nWhile we continue to spin our strategic flywheel faster to generate top line led growth. We have also progressed on a margin agenda as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long term.\nOur all-weather strategy coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create category leadership across our portfolio give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance.\nThis is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8%-9, which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation. To the extent that intense inflationary markets drive elevated price mix, the impact is oftentimes offset by currency as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure.\nDue to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in Q4.\nWe now expect comparable currency neutral Earnings Per Share growth of 9%-11.\nBased on current rates, our hedge positions. We are updating our currency outlook of an approximate three to four point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate four to five point currency headwind to comparable Earnings Per Share for full year 2023.\nInflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our basket like sugar and juice remain elevated and we have some hedges that we will be rolling off to less favorable rates.\nBased on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023.\nOur updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%.\nAll in. We are updating comparable Earnings Per Share growth of 5%-6 versus $2.48 in 2022.\nWe continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. If you exclude the transition tax payment made in Q2 and various payments associated with M&A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS.\nAs we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long term.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you'll need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks operator. Good morning everyone.\nI guess I have a question about just as we kind of look into the back half of the year and looking at organic sales, the implied organic sales guidance, which I guess is in the 5%-6 range in the back half of the year.\nMaybe James and John, can you just talk a little bit about how maybe just the macro environment or the operating conditions are today versus what you were thinking at the start of the year? Given that there's more of these markets where countries where hyperinflation is an issue, is price a little bit more of a driver in terms of the organic sales comp in the back half of the year relative to volume again versus kind of what you were thinking at the start of the year?\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Morning, Bryan. Let me try and unpack that a little bit. I think the headline part of the answer is there's a little more pricing in Q2 and in the down half than we had expected at the beginning of the year, principally around that basket of countries where inflation is high above 20% and a little more persistent. That's the short answer. The longer version of the answer is, look, we're executing the strategy we've talked about consistently over time and again in CAGNY, the real focus on upping the bar on marketing, upping the bar on RGM, the commercial strategies, and the execution of the marketplace, all with the intent about delivering a good strong top line led growth algorithm. And obviously that we've talked historically that in normal times that 5%-6 would be split between volume and price on a roughly equal basis.\nAnd so what you're seeing in the back half of the year, which I think is important to note, is we're expecting volume to be consistent in the second half with the way it was in the first half, which in the end is running on a trend, if you like, a CAGR versus 2019, similar to what we did last year. So we see sustained positive volume growth coming out of 2022 and we're looking for volume growth in the second half in a very similar way to the first half, whether you're comparing to prior year or to 2019. So we want a business that is growing consumer base for all the right appropriate strategic reasons. Then what's going to happen to revenue in the second half is we're going to see the impact of three buckets of price mix.\nThe first bucket is the carryover of pricing from prior year. Obviously, there was more cost inflation last year, but logically that is a set of numbers that is going to tend to zero by the end of December. And so that is going to step down as we go through Q3 and Q4. So bucket one carryover that's going to step down, bucket two is price increases we've made.\nSo far this year.\nThat are leaving aside the large inflation countries, look much more like a normal year.\nIn terms of what we've taken this year, both in terms of timing, number of price increases, and relative level of price increases.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stay on the line.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nWhen did I stop.\nOperator? Do you know when the line cuts on my answer?\n\nOperator\n\nUnfortunately not, sir.\nOur next question will come from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nPlease hang on a second, operator. Oh, sorry, operator. Let me just finish the other question, I'll just back up. Apologies to everyone for the technical trickiness. I'm just going to back up, and if I'm repeating something I said, apologies. If there's a gap in the logic, apologies again.\nI think we talked about volume H2, similar to H1. Whether you're talking prior year or 2019 pricing, three buckets: the bigger piece of the pricing of the three factors, which is the carryover, is obviously stepping down through the year towards zero by the end of Q4. The new pricing that's coming in 2023 being very consistent with the kind of normal level of pricing that we would see. And it's kind of in place already for the year, and that obviously then continues at the same rate through the rest of H2, and the third piece, which is about 1/4 of what's happening on PMO at the moment, this bucket of higher inflationary countries. And as I said earlier, there was a little more inflation from those countries in Q2 than we had previously expected.\nObviously, that then comes back round in a little more Forex headwind. We are assuming that some of those inflation rates will moderate in the balance of the year, in the second half, and likewise moderate in the Forex, although it's very uncertain. We'll have to see what happens. That's basically the composition of how to think about.\nThe effect of our strategy delivering good top line growth in the second half.\nNext question, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, can you hear me okay? Sounds like my line's going crackly now.\nThat's okay.\nOkay, great.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, we got you, Lauren. Cool.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Okay. Wanted to ask a little bit actually about Costa and coffee overall in light of the resource allocation model and identification of key products, profit pools, and so on. Not mentioned in the prepared remarks, but definitely called out in the press release this morning with particular strength in the UK. I guess broad question would be how coffee overall is kind of fitting in on this thought process on resource allocation models. If there are particular differences by geography because we've heard different emphasis on the category by different bottlers, and then specific to the numbers called out in the release today in Costa UK, should we think about that as recovery with mobility, Covid, or tweaks or adjustments to the strategy you've made that are beginning to come through in performance. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, sure. Lauren, let me do it in reverse order. The Q2 I think is more recovery than.\nNew stages of growth. Having said that, the Express machines have continued to expand numerically in terms of numbers of placements all the way through Covid and including so far this year. The Express business, the B2B business in the UK, has been strong, remains strong, and still growing, still gaining share. The retail recovery, the store numbers are much more about a recovery, a kind of completing the play on mobility perhaps.\nGained share a little bit. Obviously, we're focused on how to drive growth going forward. We see plenty of headroom in the UK market, but I would characterize year to date more on more of a bias to recovery on stores than new, and the bias express on new internationally speaking. If you just break it down into a couple of different buckets, the ready-to-drink bucket, we've made some good progress in China, we've made some good progress in Japan with launches of ready-to-drink Costa in the case of Japan, complementing Georgia. Actually, Japan had a pretty good start to the year, growing both Georgia and Costa, so kind of a full coffee strategy in the ready-to-drink looking good, and that's still the most important ready-to-drink coffee market for us.\nThe B2B, which is a mix of express along with kind of we're serving to providing machines and beans, is starting to see that getting some traction in Europe with the bottling partners there and starting to kind of find its feet in the US too. Those are the ones I'd call out as the most.\nAt the front of the program in terms of geographic expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning.\nI just wanted to follow up on Bryan's back half question. You did mention a weaker start in April post the Q1 call, and then the stronger June volume performance, obviously on this call. Is that engendering additional confidence internally around top line? The reason I'm asking is it sounds like conceptually you're not necessarily guiding to the June volume strength continuing in the second half. I'm just trying to understand that. Is that more just prudence given the inflationary environment you mentioned and consumer volatility, or are there other factors there? As we think about your full year organic sales growth guidance range as part of that question, was that just the upside in Q2? Was some of it maybe some upside from Q1? Did you change expectations at all for the back half within that full year organic sales growth guidance raise? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nI think, Dara, you might get the prize for the most questions in one question.\nLook.\nClearly in the second quarter, as we had anticipated in the previous call, April had started softly, but then things kind of normalized towards the end of the quarter, and June was a good, solid month of growth. I think the easier way to think about it is take the whole of the first half, because you're always going to have some good months and some bad months. April happened to concentrate some price increases in developed countries and bad rains in India. Look, that will always happen on any given month. I think what is a question of what gives us confidence in the back half of the year. If you just take January to June with its combination of good, middling, and bad months.\nThe growth rate in the first half, what we're expecting is a similar sort of growth rate in the second half, whether you compare to 2022 or to 2019. We think the momentum is there. We think in the developed markets we've got through the pricing that needed to be taken in 2023. We don't foresee substantive new pricing in the downhill. We think this is going to be.\nA well set up run through in the second half. As I called out on that other answer with Bryan, the uncertainty factor is really around the concentrated in a few of these more.\nInflationary marketplaces. Guidance going up, well, I guess there's obviously some flow through. We had a good first quarter, obviously versus consensus, a better Q2. We clearly feel confident in our outlook for the full year, which is why we're taking it up. There's some flow through, obviously there's some timing factors in the relative performance in Q2.\nAs we've talked on previous calls, given the nature of our business and where we sit in the supply chain relative to final sales, I think it's always good to take a multi-quarter average to the way of thinking about volume or pricing or even the flow through to EPS. I think that's kind of something that we always think about. Otherwise, you can get too distracted by the ups or downs on any given quarter. We're going up in the guidance. We feel confident about the second half. There'll always be some puts and takes, but we think we have a great strategy and a great plan to execute for the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning. I guess I had a question on your Asia Pacific operating margins, which were pressured again this quarter. James, you touched on a couple of markets that are still facing pressures, just hoping you could share a little bit more color and some of these headwinds in the region, and then any key initiatives you might have implemented to mitigate some of these pressures. As a result, how should we think about your margins trending through the remainder of the year in the region? Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nAs it relates to Asia Pacific, what we, there's obviously a set of things that happened in Q2 that were specific to Q2. There was some destocking in the China operating unit that was kind of a significant piece there, and there was some strong demand for some of the juice businesses in China and India.\nThose are two kind of atypical factors that happened that depressed on a timing basis the margin in Asia Pacific. It is worth noting that there is a sort of structural headwind when seen specifically just at the Asia Pacific region level. What I mean by that is that we have a very big business in Japan, which is an excellent business and has a good operating margin, but then Asia Pacific concentrates a set of fast-growing emerging and developing markets—India, China, some of the Southeast Asian countries—and given the nature of how fast they grow and their emerging profile, that is, they have price points that are lower than Japan, they create a negative geographic mix effect to the Asia Pacific reporting segment, and that's been a feature for an extended period of time.\nIn other words, you have to sell one point something cases in India and China to make up to kind of compensate the mix effect relative to Japan. That kind of structural headwind is always slightly there. Obviously, our objective is through our strategies, our marketing, RGM execution, and the way we invest to try and offset that headwind. If you look back over time, you'll see that whilst the margin fluctuates up and down, it has kind of had a certain stability when you look, for example, at 2019 versus 2022. I close by saying don't over rotate to 1/4 in the case of Asia Pacific.\nGiven some of the issues, I would also point out that this is not a region seen on its own where operating margin is likely to grow over time because of the structural mix effect. When seen at the company level, we obviously manage it as part of the overall portfolio so that it is a piece of the puzzle in looking at our total strategy of, as we've talked about, using the levers to hit that top end of the revenue at 5%-6, with a little bit of aggregate operating income margin expansion for the total enterprise, and we understand the role of each segment within that equation.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you. Actually, I want to squeeze in two topics, but I want to pick up first on James, what you were just talking about in the broader total company context in the quarter.\nThe top line was obviously strong, but I think relative to external expectations we saw a bit more margin flow through and SGA leverage than was expected, especially in regions like North America where the margin was exceptionally strong relative to history. I'm curious in terms of how to think about the balance of managing top line growth versus continued margin expansion as you think about the back half, but then also more broadly just in the context of your top line lead algo, is there maybe more cost efficiency opportunities that we should be thinking about longer term, or is what we see in the quarter maybe more just a matter of timing? I also, John, if I could, just want to loop back to a question I asked last quarter on below the line dynamics.\nIt came into the year talking about below the line deleverage, interest expense, and so on. We haven't seen that again this quarter.\nEspecially with the lower tax rate, I'm just curious if that has changed on the full year and if that factored in to the full year guidance raise. Thanks for both.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident and CFO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nLet me take the second piece first. It's fairly straightforward. In the quarter, we benefited from higher equity income and from interest that we earned on our overseas cash, which was in both cases ahead of what we had assumed when we guided at the start of the year. For the second half of the year, I don't expect either of those two to be as strong, so I do think we'll have a little bit of deleverage in the second half of the year.\nModest, not a significant variable for your consideration in the second half of the year. Cool.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah. Back to the margin element of the question. North America in a way is a flip side of what we just talked about in Asia Pacific. Obviously, the results came in very strong in North America on the top line and on the margin. Again, there are a number of.\nTiming factors that kind of flatter the second quarter margin structure in the case of North America, including, for example.\nA bit like the cost of UK bit, as was a much faster growth rate in the away-from-home than the at-home in the North American marketplace. Obviously, that's margin accretive; that should be seen as, in a way, more completing the play.\nOf the recovery versus Covid, the completion of the reopening of restaurants, cafes, theme parks, etc.\nThat channel mix, if you like, flatters the operating income in the short term.\nThere's a number of.\nTimings of other things that impact that polyamor integration, et cetera. I think the way to think about margin going forward by segment, and most importantly for the company overall, is firstly not to over rotate on any one quarter. Remember that there are a number of expenses items and deduction items that we accrue on the basis of sales curve, not just what actually happened in the quarter. Timing is a feature, and that's why I'm very strong on let's take four quarters in a row and look at that relative to history.\nWhen you do that, whether it be North America, Asia Pacific, or more importantly the company overall, what you're going to see is us sticking to our strategy, which is to drive the growth from the top line and then to look for modest or moderate increments of the operating margin, which we deliver not just by effective strategies to allocate resources, whether they be marketing or operating expenses, so that we are efficient and get a little bit of leverage there. The design of the portfolio itself and the RGM strategies also is a component in creating sales that inherently have a little more gross margin. We use all the levers to try and deliver, and so don't take these segments over or under deliveries as a sign of something new and radical happening.\nThey are features of our business model, and the big overall idea is top line growth with small increments of operating margin expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRob Ottenstein\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, James. I'd like to talk about the global system.\nRecently, you know, there's been a lot of interesting developments from some of the bottlers. You've had CCH, Finlandia, you've had a lot of your bottlers, particularly in Latin America and elsewhere, talk about B2B platforms that they're developing. My question is, how are you thinking about these developments?\nYou know, are there new models, revenue earnings sharing models, and how do you make sure that the bottlers stay focused on those products that drive the most value for The Coca-Cola Company? Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure.\nLet me start just by headlining. Actually, we've just come off. Last week we had a global bottler meeting in Atlanta. I think it's been 30+ years since we had that meeting in Atlanta, we had it in Atlanta last week with the majority of the biggest bottlers in the Coke system. I think it was.\nA very clear meeting on our collective will, ability, and interest in investing in this business and our overall level of alignment on what's important and what should we drive individually and what needs to be driven collectively. I actually, you know, you guys all go round and talk to the bottlers as well. I think you will get it reflected back from them that there is a very high degree not just of alignment on what needs to be done, but enthusiasm on the opportunities ahead of us to drive the business, our collective business, forward.\nOn some of the specifics, clearly you got in that basket. There are things that happen around the world that are local and obey a set of dynamics that are important and relevant and not necessarily projectable around the world. The case of CCH and the distribution, now the ownership of Finlandia, I think is one of those. The B2B platforms, which are progressed very nicely in Latin America, are a feature of the business in multiple other countries. We've been testing, exploring, and developing individually and collectively B2B platforms with the principal objective of enhancing the system and, most importantly, the bottlers' relationships with the retailers to the extent that we can complement, and here we're largely talking the fragmented channel because the relationship with the modern trade is already.\nSet on electronic platforms anyway. We're talking about the fragmented trade, and the majority of the almost 30 million customers we visit as a system is to enhance that relationship, to make it no longer hostage to the visit of the Coke sales rep, but to make it a 24/7 opportunity to enhance the relationship, to order product, to ask for a service call, to get a new cooler, to put some umbrellas up, or to add to an order that's already about to be delivered. That is certainly when we have evaluated how those customers, the B2B platforms are available, how they're doing versus where it's not yet rolled out. There's clearly an improvement not just in the relationship, however you want to measure it, but also in the sales. There's a lot going on in the system.\nI think the last thought there is you should take it also as examples of the willingness of the system to experiment, try, and be on the front edge of what drives value in the marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Carey\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning.\nJames.\nYou made a comment on some private label switching happening in certain markets. Can you just expand on where you're seeing this specifically, geographically and perhaps by category, and the playbook that you'll be deploying in these markets, the sorts of developments that you'd be looking for to respond to these actions ahead. I ask that a bit in the context of clearly some of your ingredients are still quite inflationary and whether you see any potential risk to being able to price against that inflation in some of these markets going forward. Obviously you have a playbook with a lot of different levers. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on where these developments seem to be happening and how you think about responding to these a bit more specifically. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nSure. Private label switching is principally a feature firstly in Europe, and then to some extent also in the US. If you were to include price brands or B brands, you might see some of that also.\nIn Latin America, depending on how you want to define it. Very specifically on private label, that's number one, a European effect, and number two, a US effect. It's.\nIn our view, highly related to the strength of the brands in any specific category. We see it more in terms of beverages happening in water and juices rather than soft drinks, and certainly less when you get.\nThe strategy on top of what we need to do in terms of marketing and continuing to make the brands relevant to the consumers and executing in the marketplace is of course the RGM strategy. Yes, premiumization remains an opportunity, but we need to keep an anchor and continue to evolve and adapt our strategies on affordability, whether that be refillables, whether it be affordable small packs, or affordable future consumption packs. That has become something that is a tested strategy in inflationary environments, well learned in Latin America, for example, but now applied, has been for a number of years in Europe and in the US, and we have more things we can do in both marketplaces to have an anchor in both affordability and premiumization. That's a playbook that we're rolling out and executing in those marketplaces.\nAs it relates to the inflation and the costs coming through, obviously some of that, whether it be juice or sugar and corn syrup, affects different markets the most. Inflation is in a set of markets where we do price the local inflation. In a way, the higher inflation gets, the more likely it is you're going to follow inflation, and so the risk not following.\nIs not really there as it goes up. The risk actually appears on the volume side. This is a select group of markets. If it were to.\nIf it were to err towards more inflation in the back half of the year, we think it's manageable. If we were to err to less inflation, that would be good, but we think it's in a bucket of manageable things. As it relates to the total company relative to some of those input costs, we have very long term relationships with most providers and long term hedging programs.\nWhich allow us to kind of, they don't avoid inflation, but they smooth it, which then makes it much more manageable from a pricing and packaging point of view.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Can you guys talk a bit more about your alcohol strategy broadly, particularly with the Red Tree Beverages subsidiary, and specifically in terms of like new innovation? Any other subcategories or areas where you're looking to expand within alcohol? I know you're experimenting, but just any color on your future plans will be great. Thank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nYeah, thanks. Look, the Red Tree.\nEntity that we stood up in the Q2 is more of a technicality than some new big step forward. It isn't a change of strategy, and it's not a vehicle to distribute in the US. It allows us a better platform to engage with the partners that we're working with in the US in terms of coordinating and influencing the marketing, and allows us a better separation of the alcohol versus the non-alcohol ban. It's more an optimization of the model and how we want to execute things rather than a different thing. In terms of progress, look, it's still a small part of the business, and as I talked about, I think it was Cagney. Cagney. It's great, and there are lots of runs on the board. Jack Daniel's & Coca-Cola has got some really promising nice results, including in the US.\nSimply Spiked Peach is performing very nicely in the US. If you want to look for a really bright spot, you can head to the Philippines and Jack Daniel's & Coca-Cola and Lemon-Dou, which is an alcoholic lemon drink, you know, got well over 30% share of the ARTD category. All of this is very encouraging as we continue to take a measured approach to this and to kind of learn and apply our learnings. All of this needs to generate belief that it can be material to The Coca-Cola Company, not just a nice business, and that we're still in the process of driving towards. Certainly, so far we're pleased with what's taken place, and we are encouraged about the next steps that we have to take.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you. Thank you for squeezing me in, James, on your volumes commentary, and I appreciate that on your four-year CAGR. I think if our math is correct, it is 1.7% unit case for total company, which is obviously remarkable. That said, I think EMEA was a bit softer in the quarter. I understand your commentary about Russia and what is actually happening in EMEA ex.\nRussia and how we should be thinking.\nGoing forward and related to that, since you commented that the US was very strong out of home, and a big percentage of Europe is out of home. On the comments about June, how we should be thinking not only about Europe.\nBut the performance of on-premise against off-premise globally.\nThank you.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nHang on, I'm trying to process all the questions. I think you've beaten that. Was it Dara? I think you've beaten Dara.\nEMEA was a bit softer. Yeah, I think.\nEven though, so on EMEA we're expecting EMEA to be positive in the H2, and so there was a ramp effect from the withdrawal from Russia in the Q2. But, so Europe was in pretty good shape. Actually, Europe ex-Russia, if you take the H1, Europe ex-Russia was positive. So we are feeling that now it's dropped out of the base numbers in the H2 that actually Europe and EMEA will be in good shape. Obviously, EMEA has got a couple of the hyperinflationary countries like Turkey and like Pakistan. So EMEA could get other effects. But if you concentrate where Russia is, which is Europe, which is the biggest impact. Actually, Europe had a positive volume in the H1 if you take out Russia.\nAnd so we're feeling good about Europe as we go into the second half. And I think the question really is the trade-off between pricing and volume in a couple of countries, particularly Turkey, Pakistan, and, for those that want to go deep down the rabbit hole, Zimbabwe as well.\nNow the next part of the question which was about away from home versus at home.\nYeah. It wasn't just June which was the strength in the US. Basically, the first half you've seen the out of home growing ahead of the at home.\nThe recovery. And I think that's the way to think about it is we're seeing the back end of the recovery in the Away-From-Home. Similarly in Europe, in fact, globally transactions were ahead of volume, which tends to imply smaller packages are growing faster than bigger packages from a mathematical point of view. So as a global feature, there's a little more on-premise consumption or a little more small package consumption than large package consumption, which helps as well. But I don't think we should see this as that new secular trend more the kind of the last bit of renormalization post Covid.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today will come from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So James, maybe just two quick follows. One just on Chris' question around trade down and improving affordability, do you expect any changes in the promotional environment, particularly in North America? It doesn't sound like that's a shift you expect, but just wanted to be sure. And then just following up on your response to Andrea's question, you know, I would be curious how you see channel mix evolving as consumers seek more value in some of these developed markets, particularly just given the strength from, you know, Away-From-Home that you just alluded to. Thanks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company",
    "content2": "We see the US pricing and promotional environment as pretty rational.\nWe have a set of strategies in place to try and balance.\nOur premiumization, regular, and affordability strategies in the US, which includes a little more promotion than the first quarter. But basically, promo levels are very similar to prior years and not as stepped up. And we think that we have the right balance of premiumization and affordability plays to be able to continue to gain, as we did in the Q2, volume and value share in the US, so we think the environment is rational. We think our strategy works for us because we gain volume and value share, and we've got the right mix of roughly the right mix of promo and price. And obviously, we're going to continue to push the affordability and the premiumization play. And then the channel mix question.\nDo we think we'll see in developing markets?\nI think the principal feature is a renormalization post-COVID. I don't think it's kind of recessionary or inflationary or that. I think it's just been. We've kind of seen a renormalization of the channel mix. We had talked over prior years about how big an impact on price mix and margin structure the shift in channels were, with what seems ages ago, the lockdowns, that has now largely played out. Which is another way of saying we don't expect channel mix to be a major feature.\nOf the discussion in quarters and years to come.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\n\nJames Quincey\n\nChairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company\n\nYes, thank you, operator. So, to just quickly summarize Q2 results. I think demonstrate the momentum we have in the marketplace. We are navigating a broad set of dynamics in the local markets while driving scale and maintaining flexibility at a global level. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our 23 guidance and our longer term objectives. Thanks for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\nI would now like to introduce Mrs. Robin Halpern, Vice President Head of Investor Relations.\nMrs. Halpern, you may now begin.\n\nRobin Halpern\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins.\nIn addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. [Operator Instructions].\nNow I'll turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nCEO & Director, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. 2023 is off to a good start. We continue to execute well and grow amidst the dynamic macro environment. We like to say we have an all-weather strategy, one that enables us to thrive no matter what's happening in the world.\nWe pursue excellence globally with an eye towards winning locally as a system. And our brand investments continue to create value for our customers and consumers, leading to our ability to drive quality growth for our stakeholders.\nToday, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide some perspective around today's global consumer and macro environment. I'll then reiterate why we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the full year. And finally, I'll elaborate on how the actions we're taking set us up for success in any environment and how we're driving resilience for our business and continued growth in 2023 and over the long term. John will then discuss our results and go into more detail on the 2023 outlook.\nIn the first quarter, pandemic restrictions in parts of the world relaxed, and many supply chain pressures abated. At the same time, inflation and geopolitical tensions persisted. And new concerns emerged around the stability in the banking sector and the magnitude of the potential squeeze on consumers.\nIn the face of these factors, we continue to generate momentum as investments in our brands got the year off to a positive start. We remain focused on creating value by meeting the needs of our customers and consumers.\nWe delivered 12% organic revenue growth in the quarter. This was primarily driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers.\nWe also delivered volume growth of 3%, which is in line with last year versus 2019. We saw growth across developed as well as developing and emerging markets, and we continue to gain both volume and value share for the quarter, including at home and away from home channels. We're encouraged by this momentum and are operating the business with a focus on growth while closely monitoring macro trends for signs of a slowdown.\nAs we look around the world today, the consumer picture varies across our markets. In Asia Pacific, the reopening of China has led to an increase in consumer activity, but consumption is still recovering to pre-pandemic levels. India's economy remains resilient with a strong job market and robust consumption. In Japan, consumers are feeling inflationary pressure for the first time in many years.\nIn Europe, the recent banking crisis added to last year's energy spike, driving further uncertainty to purchasing behaviors and consumers continue to increasingly seek out affordable and private label options across many FMCG categories.\nIn North America, the picture is a mixed bag with unemployment low, gas prices improved and savings holding up, but inflation and higher mortgage rates are top-of-mind concerns for many consumers.\nIn many developing and emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, consumers continue to face varying levels of inflation and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions. Clearly, there's uncertainty in how the consumer environment may ultimately play out in 2023. But thanks to the hard work of our people and partners, we're a more flexible network enterprise today. And with our enhanced system alignment, we're confident we can win together locally in a wide variety of environments.\nLet's start with the portfolio. We have a growth portfolio of consumer-centric brands across categories, including [ 26 billion-dollar brands ]. Our networked organization is allowing us to raise the bar of innovation and marketing to leverage our loved brands more effectively in the marketplace. We're keeping our streamlined portfolio of brands relevant with consumers and finding innovative ways to offer beverage choices for every occasion.\nIn Japan, we recently relaunched our Georgia Coffee brand with a fresh new look and a bright proposition to inspire current consumers and expand Georgia's appeal to a broader audience, complementing Costa's premium ready-to-drink offerings in that market.\nWe're expanding our exploration in alcohol ready-to-drink beverages with a keen focus on responsibility. We work with Brown-Forman to roll out Jack and Coke cocktails in the U.S. during the quarter with more markets launching now. It's early days, but the ability to get one of the most popular [indiscernible] in the world in a can is proving to be compelling to retailers and consumers based on preliminary volumes and velocities. We're encouraged by the level of engagement as distribution expands.\nWe're driving bigger and bolder innovations that can leverage consumer insights leading to a higher success rate and enduring growth. In North America, we continue to foster brand love for fairlife, which has grown volume double digits for 8 consecutive years. Fairlife became a $1 billion brand last year, and we're building on the momentum of the brand including the success of co-power with fairlife nutrition plan. Launched with a digital-first campaign in the club channel, fairlife nutrition plan has seen strong consumer interest from those looking for high-protein, low-sugar shake that tastes great and is lactose-free. We're planning to expand the product to more channels and packages in the coming months.\nWe're working with WPP, our global marketing network partner, and increasingly leveraging digital capabilities to engage consumers through passion points, personalized experiences and collaborations. The Coke Studio concept first drove cultural relevance and brand performance in Pakistan, with the latest season streamed over 1 billion times. We scaled the program to 30 markets last year. And in 2023, it will become an always-on platform across the globe. Connecting consumers' love of music to consumption occasions by spotlighting breakthrough talent, Coke Studio provides a portal to live digital experiences and can be activated using QR codes on our packages.\nConsumers can drink, scan and enjoy their favorite beverage along with music from genres around the world. Working as a network system with our bottlers, we're managing through macroeconomic uncertainty with enhanced capabilities in revenue growth management and integrated execution. We often talk about the many levers of revenue growth management. While the inflationary environment led to proactive pricing increases over the past 18 months, it's important to recognize our RGM capabilities to extend far beyond pricing.\nAt its core, revenue growth management is about consumer-centric segmentation, ensuring we have the right product in the right package in the right channel at the right price point, drive transactions and meet consumers where they are.\nAffordability and premiumization are key levers to maintain and expand our consumer base, and we continue to balance affordable offerings with compelling premium propositions to ensure we have beverage options across income levels.\nAffordability is a driver in developing and emerging markets, evidenced by double-digit volume growth in these offerings in Indonesia and Vietnam, helping to drive record sparkling share in Vietnam and driving approximately 3 billion transactions at affordable price points in India this quarter. Premium packages like slim cans and mini cans are seeing strong growth in many markets, including Australia, where mini cans drove 40 million transactions and contributed to share growth in the region.\nPremiumization also includes [indiscernible] occasions. In addition to alcohol, ready-to-drink beverages, we're also participating more broadly in adult alcohol drinking occasions.\nIn North America, we've expanded our Simply premium juice brand into the mix of segment with Simply mixology in 3 flavors to serve as a cocktail or mocktail. In Europe, we've relaunched our Kinley and Royal Bliss brands as harmonized platforms to participate in the adult mixer segment.\nFor both affordability and premiumization, the value proposition is often messaged at the point of sale, such as the expansion of the value bundle in certain channels in the U.S. and the mini can mini price campaign that drove strong growth in small packages in Japan. RGM, coupled with integrated execution, also drives value for our customers. By providing key insights and offering the right mix of brands, packages, price points and compelling data-driven promotions, we are able to partner with customers that deliver traffic, basket and incidence growth.\nLatin America is a great example of how this came to life in the first quarter, evidenced by revenue growth ahead of transactions and transaction growth ahead of volume. By working closely with key retailers, our system focused on the availability of cold, single-serve beverages in premium brands such as Schweppes and smartwater.\nWe introduced refillable packages into new channels, all while driving better in-stock levels and higher consumer traffic in-store, owning accolades from customers. Our business has largely recovered from the effects of the pandemic and remains well equipped to navigate the dynamic macro environment and is emerging with even stronger capabilities and system alignment to deliver vibrant long-term growth for many years to come.\nAt the same time, our consumers also care about sustainability. While we strive to grow our business, we also want to be water positive, drive a circular economy for our packaging and grow consumer beverage choices, including low- and no-calorie brands as part of our total beverage strategy. These goals are integral to our business and beneficial for society.\nOur annual business and sustainability will be released soon, including an integrated section on our World without Waste packaging initiatives. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, recognize there is still opportunity ahead and continue to lead as well as act collectively with other key stakeholders to drive progress on this agenda. I encourage you to learn more about how we're progressing against our targets across various sustainability pillars and priorities to refresh the world and make a difference.\nBefore I hand over to John, I'd note that it's early in the year, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the operating environment ahead. But our first quarter results give us increased visibility to deliver on our full year 2023 guidance.\nWe're executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level, maintaining flexibility on a global level and continuing to reinvest in the business and build the system for the long term. In short, we're expanding the sphere of what we can control. We're well prepared to respond with speed to changing market dynamics as we've demonstrated that we can do. By staying clear on our purpose and remaining consumer-centric, we continue to execute to the sustainable long-term growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We've had a good start to the year with strong first quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 12%. Unit cases grew 3% with broad-based growth across most markets, driven by investments in the marketplace.\nConcentrate sales were 2 points behind unit cases for the quarter primarily driven by timing of concentrate shipments and 1 less day. Our price/mix growth was 11% for the quarter. Much of this was driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments as well as revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix.\nComparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 120 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency. Underlying gross margin expansion was driven by a benefit from the phasing of inventory costs, strong organic revenue growth and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses, partially offset by higher commodity costs.\nComparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments, partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher operating costs. Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 reflects an increase of 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 7% currency headwinds.\nFree cash flow was negative by approximately $120 million in the quarter. This was largely attributable to the timing of working capital initiatives and the previously discussed M&A-related payments that took place in the quarter.\nOur underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we feel confident in our cash flow agenda and full year outlook. Our balance [ achieves ] fit for purpose to support our growth agenda, and our net debt leverage of 1.8x EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to invest to drive long-term growth and to deliver dividend growth for our shareowners as evidenced by the 5% dividend increase announced in February.\nWe remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS. We are currently waiting for the tax court to render its final opinion in the case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. We will continue to keep you updated.\nAs James mentioned, we are encouraged by our first quarter results and are harnessing what we can control to remain resilient in the face of a volatile operating environment. We remain laser-focused on top line-led growth as well as the endurance of the bottom line. And we'll reinvest in our brands with more rigor and discipline using the refreshed resource allocation framework we discussed at CAGNY.\nThis approach enables the enterprise to prioritize and put more focus behind country and category combinations that can deliver the best return in the near term while fueling steady progress on our total beverage strategy over time, it also allows us to be more dynamic and to adapt quickly.\nFor example, in emerging markets, where commercial beverages are still a small part of daily consumption, we're leading with core sparkling and juice strengths propositions. In developed markets, where consumers are looking for more beverage choices, we're investing behind a broader portfolio of brands and categories, including value-added dairy, enhanced water, tea and coffee.\nDespite the global macro picture remaining uncertain in the months ahead, our planned investments and operational strategy will support the momentum we've seen early in the year and give us good visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance. This guidance is comprised of organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment, comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9%.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of an approximate 2- to 3-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 3- to 4-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023.\nInflationary forces are moderating in some respects. Spot prices have come down in oil and freight rates are more favorable. That said, many commodities were exposed to have been sticky, and we have some advantageous hedges that will be rolling off to less favorable rates during the year.\nBased on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Additionally, we expect wages and inflation in media will continue to remain elevated.\nDespite the increase in the first quarter effective tax rate, we continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. All in, we are reiterating comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022.\nWe expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to remind you that included in cash from operations are 2 discrete items related to, one, transition tax payments, which will take place in the second quarter; and two, payments associated with M&A transactions. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance.\nThis guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS. Overall, we don't expect the tax dispute to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind as it pertains to our guidance. We expect price/mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. The discrete gross margin benefits related to the phasing of inventory costs and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses this quarter are unlikely to repeat. Given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt.\nAnd finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. With a quarter of good results to start the year and our focus on driving top line-led growth in any macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned to compound quality value by delivering on 2023 guidance.\nOur network structure and aligned system are enabling us to deliver on our 3 key objectives: pursuing excellence globally and winning locally, investing for the long-term health of the business and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. The strength of our people and great partnerships with our bottlers around the world give us confidence in our ability to win with consumers in the marketplace and deliver value for our stakeholders.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\n\nTimothy K. Leveridge\n\nVP & IR Officer, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins.\nIn addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first and then reenter the queue. Now let me turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nChairman & CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us. We executed well and grew amidst a challenging macro environment. We did this in part by focusing on expanding the spear of what we can control. We delivered on our top line and bottom-line guidance, and we continue to create value by investing in our loved brands even as we faced a very dynamic backdrop.\nToday, I'll reflect on our fourth quarter and the year's performance and set the stage for 2023. I'll also share how we're operating differently today, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 guidance and well equipped for a future that continues to be volatile and uncertain. John will then discuss our results and our 2023 outlook in more detail.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the environment remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions, pandemic-related mobility restrictions and currency volatility persisted. Despite this range of factors, consumer demand held up relatively well, and our industry remains strong.\nIn the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our growth strategy and continued to create value for our consumers and customers. We maintained agility to navigate this challenging environment and delivered 15% organic revenue growth in the quarter with strong growth across operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers. While we saw robust volume growth across many markets, this was more than offset by the suspension of our business in Russia and the impact on consumption driven by varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions and the surge in COVID cases in China.\nOverall, throughout 2022, we have maintained consistent volume growth relative to 2019. We've gained both volume and value share for the consolidated business for both the quarter and the year. So far, in 2023, the volume growth trends versus 2019 are in line with last year, and we are laser-focused on executing on our growth plans.\nOur streamlined portfolio of global and local brands and stepped-up consumer-facing investments continue to fuel the competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system to deliver value in any environment. Our network organizational structure enables this strategy. We've connected our operating units, our functions and our platform services organization for strong end-to-end coordination, which helps us identify key opportunities for meaningful long-term growth. And on top of this, we remain well aligned with our bottling partners, which further builds on our strength as a network system.\nAs we look to 2023, many uncertainties remain in the macro economy, whether from economic policies, consumer demand, inflation, supply chain, war and geopolitics. Instead of trying to forecast and predict the many directions things could move, we are focused on delivering on our key objectives: firstly, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to continue the top-line momentum; secondly, investing for the long-term health of the business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; thirdly, generating U.S. dollar EPS growth to deliver value for our share-owners.\nWe continue to build the right capabilities and strengthen the system alignment to deliver in a dynamic world, and we continue to invest to raise the bar. We are executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level while maintaining flexibility on a global level.\nThroughout 2022, we saw many examples of harnessing our enhanced capabilities to win locally. Our new marketing model is working. We've linked occasions and passion points to drive engagement. We're experimenting to optimize marketing. This is driving deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in unique and new ways. We are tying our beverages to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences.\nFor example, in Vietnam, to support the reopening of away-from-home accounts, we launched the pilot of \"Coke is Cooking\" campaign in October. In this month-long campaign to help drive traffic back to stores, we partnered with more than 700 food shops. We created thousands of food and Coke combo deals that consumers purchased at these food shops, along with \"Coke is Cooking\" merchandising and digital support by our local influencers. This was the first time we used an on-ground event as a commercial asset, creating a social and digital content generator. The campaign resulted in more than 1 million combo transactions and 20% uplift for participating merchants.\nWe're leveraging passion points locally to create immersive experiences and drive consumption. For example, in Latin America, our live music strategy created memorable in-person and digital experiences, elevating consumer engagement. We partnered with Rock in Rio, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, and creating new opportunities for consumers to access content through live streams and in the Metaverse. As a result, we boosted our reach from approximately 700,000 attendees to more than 45 million consumers across the region, and our sales inside the festival increased 23% versus the last festival.\nIn India, the Thums Up Stump Cam was a never before-seen activation for cricket fans where consumers could scan a QR code on product label and get access to exclusive match moments of the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup through a camera installed on one of the wickets. Throughout the 45-day tournament, we use first-party data and artificial intelligence to send personalized content to consumers based on their favorite matches, and we amplified the experience through sports influencers. This campaign showed strong results with Thums Up growing volume ahead of our total sparkling portfolio in India during the activation period, contributing to strong volume growth for Thums Up for the full year. This drove about 1/4 of India's total volume growth for the year.\nThums Up also experienced its highest monthly market-share jump during the activation period. We are driving consumer interest and action through digital experiences using the power of partnerships across platforms. For example, in Germany, we partnered with our key online customer and created voice-based branded experiences with its voice assistant to drive engagement and grow positive brand perception. This allowed consumers to learn more about Coca-Cola products and shop on voice assistant-enabled devices using only their voice.\nThe campaign delivered strong results with a reach of 11 million impressions. Additionally, consumers that engaged with its voice-based experience had a 25% add-to-cart rate.\nAnd lastly, we're delivering new and unexpected innovation by leveraging Gen Z insights. In the U.S., we launched Minute Maid Aguas Frescas. The product is made with real fruit juices, is noncarbonated and comes in 3 exciting flavors. It was originally available as a limited launch in 16-ounce ready-to-drink cans. A disruptive end-to-end digital media marketing campaign created early momentum, which led us to quickly scale this experiment to our Freestyle platform and other fountain offerings. In 2022, the product had a 60% repeat rate and won the Best New Product award from Convenience Store News.\nWe have been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities for many years, and we've made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset much of the inflation we saw in 2022 and delivered strong volume and transaction growth. There is still much work to be done to maximize revenue by further segmenting our markets and consumers based on additional variables.\nWe are leveraging digital and data-backed insights to better understand our consumers. This will help drive affordable propositions for basket incidence growth and recruit new drinkers. It will also lead to premiumization to drive price and mix. For example, in Europe, we grew both volume and value share for the last year. We partnered with key customers to drive growth through affordability and premiumization initiatives that tapped into the key consumption occasions of meals and breaks. This end-to-end execution resulted in higher basket incidents and buying households across all key channels in Europe.\nGlobally, this strong system execution focus generated 80 million additional shopping trips for our products and added 17 million households to our base. Through our stepped-up capabilities, we are getting better at synchronizing demand creation and demand fulfillment, driving top-tier value creation for our customers.\nWe measure success by the value we create for our stakeholders and by how we are creating a better shared future for people, communities and the planet. During 2022, we made progress across these sustainability priorities. We leveraged our marketing power to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and continue to provide smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar intake. Approximately 2/3 of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving.\nOn packaging, we've set a new industry-leading goal to have 25% of our volume globally being refillable or reusable packaging by 2030. Additionally, we are continuing to increase cooler energy efficiency and the use of HFC-free coolers to make progress on our science-based targets while creating a clear road map with our system and suppliers to achieve our carbon emissions reduction ambition.\nOn water, as part of our 2030 Water Security Strategy, we stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions exemplified by the work we're doing with the Nature Conservancy and other partners. Globally, we are working to strengthen the links between replenishment projects and nature-based solutions.\nWe further embedded sustainability into our strategy by linking Diversity, Equity, Inclusion performance measures to our executive annual incentive program and by linking water and our PET packaging measures to our executives' long-term incentive program. Overall, we continue to focus on using our leadership and scale to drive change while delivering results and building resilience.\nFinally, before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that our strong results in 2022 reflect the collective efforts of our system partners and the growth mindset of our system employees. Guided by our purpose, we are investing behind our capabilities and further cultivating our growth mindset to be well positioned to create value and deliver on our objectives.\nWhile we have momentum in our business, we know uncertainty remains as we turn the page to a new year. We will continue to focus on expanding the sphere of what we can control to drive growth in 2023 and beyond. We'll talk about this in more detail when we return to CAGNY in person next Tuesday and would encourage all of you to listen in.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident & CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong top line-led results as we executed for growth in a dynamic operating environment. We grew organic revenues 15%. Unit cases declined 1% as broad-based growth across most markets and investments in the marketplace were more than offset by the suspension of business in Russia and the decline in China. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit cases for the quarter primarily driven by one additional day and the timing of Concentrate shipments.\nOur price/mix growth of 12% was driven by pricing actions across operating segments along with revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year mainly driven by currency headwinds in a volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business.\nUnderlying gross margin was in line with the prior year driven by strong organic revenue growth offset by higher commodity costs. We continued to significantly accelerate our marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers as well as, again, new consumers. Despite higher costs across the P&L, increased marketing and currency headwinds, comparable operating margin expanded 65 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top-line growth across operating segments.\nImportantly, this resulted in full year comparable operating margin be in line with the prior year despite significant currency acquisition and cost headwinds. Below the line, we were impacted by higher net interest expense, along with lower other income due to cycling higher pension income from the prior year. Therefore, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.45 was in line with last year despite higher-than-expected currency headwinds. This resulted in full year comparable EPS of $2.48, an increase of 7% versus the prior year driven by strong underlying business performance partially offset by 10 points of currency headwinds.\nFor the year, we delivered free cash flow of $9.5 billion, a decline of 15% versus the prior year. Much of the decline versus our expectations occurred due to the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment and higher-than-anticipated tax payments. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher incentive payments in 2022. Even with these items, our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to make progress on our cash flow agenda. Our 3-year average free cash flow conversion ratio is above 100%, ahead of our long-term target.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8x EBITDA as of the end of 2022, which is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth as well as delivering dividend growth for our share-owners.\nAt the same time, we remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and are learning from the last few years of how important it is to build resilience in all of our plans. As James mentioned, in 2023, we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic. We have the right portfolio, a very focused strategy, a flexible and adaptable structure and a system with the ability to reinvest in the business. This gives us the confidence that we will continue to deliver on our 3 key objectives: pursuing excellence globally, and winning locally; investing for the long-term health of the business; generating U.S. dollar EPS growth.\nWith that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2023 that builds on our strong results in 2022. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8% primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment. And we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% versus 2022.\nSince we provided our initial outlook on currency in October, the currency environment has improved but remains volatile. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2- to 3-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 3- to 4-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023.\nBased on current rates and hedge positions, we expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. And all in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022.\nWe expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to highlight that included in the $11.4 billion of cash from operations are 2 discrete items: transition tax payments of approximately $720 million; a scheduled increase of $335 million versus 2022; payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $350 million. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS.\nRecently, the tax court issued an opinion on a case involving a separate company. The tax court will now apply this opinion to our case and ultimately render a final decision in our case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. Overall, we don't expect this to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind for 2023. We expect price/mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. While the inflationary environment appears to be cooling, we are still expecting to see elevated inflation across our operating costs. We have stepped up our marketing investments over the last few years, and we will continue to invest to support momentum. And given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt.\nFinally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be 1 less day in the first quarter and 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. Having delivered strong results in 2022, we are focused on driving a top line-led growth equation in many types of environments. We are well positioned to deliver on guidance for 2023, thanks to the incredible people we have around the world, the strong alignment we have with our bottling partners and the great plans we have for the coming year.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions)\nI would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\n\nTimothy K. Leveridge\n\nVP & IR Officer, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins.\nIn addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nNow let me turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nChairman & CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we continued our momentum in the third quarter with effective execution across our global system despite a macro backdrop that remains challenging. In the face of these pressures, consumers stayed resilient, and we continue to invest behind our loved brands to drive value in the marketplace and growth in our business.\nGiven our strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we are raising our top line and bottom line guidance, while continuing to invest strategically. So this morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how we are expanding the circumference of what we can control. Then I'll pass to John, and he will discuss financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for the full year 2022 and some early considerations for 2023.\nDuring the third quarter, macroeconomic crosscurrents continued to impact the operating environment. The conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, which creates challenges in that country and beyond. And we saw renewed pandemic-related mobility restrictions in China. Inflationary forces are driving costs, pricing and interest rates higher, resulting in currency volatility in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, our industry remains healthy and is growing both in value and volume, which continues to include some benefit from cycling COVID-related impacts from the prior year.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across all operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions and robust volume growth. We had share gains overall and across most categories, as well as within both at-home and away-from-home channels. We accomplished this by investing in our business and providing the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and add consumers. Notably, we drove revenue growth ahead of transactions growth, which is also ahead of volume growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our revenue growth management capabilities.\nConsumer elasticities in core categories have continued to hold up well. We are leveraging our consumer-centric marketing model and increasingly using digital engagement to link consumption occasions with passion points. And our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to leverage the vast experiences of the systems' leaders from various parts of the world. We are increasingly sharing learnings and generating faster responses to a changing environment through the right mix of local relevance and scale.\nNow recapping the third quarter performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we continued to strengthen in the first half of the year as we gained share in sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coke delivered strong growth through effective execution and occasion-based marketing. Year-to-date, we drove approximately 2.5 billion transactions at affordable price points through the expansion of returnable glass bottles and single-serve PET packages. Sprite has grown to become a $1 billion brand in the market, driven by the success of locally-adapted occasion-based global marketing campaigns like Heat Happens and Screentime.\nIn Japan, we continue to strengthen our business amidst an inflationary environment in the country for the first time in many years, we took price increases in large PET packages. Through intelligent innovation on small packs, we've gained value share, transactions and household penetration year-to-date. Additionally, we continued our strong share gains in vending in the quarter, and we expanded our leadership position in e-commerce.\nIn China, we grew volume in the quarter and achieved strong growth in sparkling soft drinks during the summer selling season amidst varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. We focused on digital to unlock new opportunities. We deployed Fanta Festival, a drink, scan, win pilot at scale, which drove widespread brand exposure and connected consumer traffic to more than 30,000 outlets. We remain focused on executing RGM strategies to drive outlet expansion and increase key SKU availability.\nIn ASEAN and South Pacific, we saw strong volume and transaction growth across most markets, driven by new product launches and continued recovery in away-from-home channels. We saw significant top line improvement in sparkling flavors for most markets, driven by our Sprite Lemon+ and Schweppes Zero Sugar innovations.\nIn EMEA, European consumers continue to experience inflationary costs. We leveraged our RGM strategies to drive away-from-home, single-serve mix and retain consumers, and delivered value share gains across most categories. And our system has delivered top-tier incremental retail value for customers year-to-date for a second year in a row. We accelerated digital engagement with more than 4 million connected consumers year-to-date.\nIn Africa, despite the macro environment remaining challenging, we gained volume and value share. We focus relentlessly on excellence in execution and reduced retail out-of-stocks. We've built sustainable customer engagement in more than 80,000 points of sale year-to-date through a customer loyalty partnership program.\nIn Eurasia and the Middle East, we remain resilient amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment in many markets and some supply-related disruptions. A cross-market launch of fee for activation and the Fanta Fest campaign were in key enablers of growth. With strong focus on execution, we placed over 50,000 coolers and have gained availability in 33,000 new outlets year-to-date.\nIn North America, we drove volume and value share gains through strong core sparkling performance, complemented by robust innovation and music-led experiential marketing despite intermittent supply chain challenges. Smartwater growth was strong during the quarter and innovations like Coca-Cola Creations and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas continue to expand and exceed expectations. The Coca-Cola value bundle, a collection of core sparkling offerings, providing more choices to cost-conscious consumers, is helping to retain and recruit more consumers while creating value for our customers.\nIn Latin America, we leveraged connected experiences and strong execution to drive top line growth and sequentially improve on our share losses. We strengthened our connections with use through music, leveraging the Coca-Cola Marshmello flavor to stream Rock in Rio across the continent. Through RGM initiatives, we focused on single-serve package growth to drive transaction growth. Alignment with our bonding partners remain strong, and our joint market initiatives are ensuring our focus on accelerating growth.\nIn Global Ventures, we witnessed robust volume growth. However, overall cost of performance was impacted by a dynamic operating environment in the U.K., along with investments in the marketplace as we expand internationally. China ready-to-drink value share grew with the strong performance of innovations like Costa Char Tea and Coke Coffee. Ready-to-drink in Japan is also delivering strong performance supported by sampling, in-store execution and the launch of Caramel Latte.\nFinally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong volume and top line performance driven by a focus on affordable entry-pack expansion across all markets. Additionally, we're driving availability and efficiencies in cost to serve.\nAs we look forward beyond this year, we continue to see great opportunity for our industry. We are allocating resources in a disciplined way to gain share. Success from our marketing model is based on 2 critical components: linking occasions and passion points to drive engagement and leveraging experiments to optimize our marketing. This drives deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in new and unique ways.\nThe launch of the Believing is Magic global campaign for the FIFA World Cup celebrates the passionate journey of soccer fans by unveiling a suite of digital experiences that capture the full extent of fans' devotion to their beloved teams. The campaign includes the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour as well as a digital hub called Coca-Cola Fan Zone, which creates in-person opportunities for fans to come together to trade Panini stickers behind the Coca-Cola labels. This campaign has already led to a gain of more than 3.5 million consumers for direct engagement.\nBuilding on our digital experiments, we also announced a strategic partnership in 6 countries with Grab, Southeast Asia's leading connected app. This builds new consumer connections and offers a new level of convenience. Through a mix of off-line advertising on the Grab fleet, online advertising in the Grab app, gamification and product sampling, we are building more purchasing occasions to grow demand for at-home consumption.\nOur innovations have delivered strong results with more than 25% contribution to incremental gross profit year-to-date. Our innovations span markets and categories, with 55% of year-to-date innovations outside of the sparkling category. Our pipeline is robust and we are excited about their unique consumer propositions.\nFor example, Coca-Cola Creations is providing bold on-trend flavors designed to build buzz with younger consumers. Ready-to-drink Costa offers new and exciting flavors with authentic, rich coffee and milk taste. We are also excited about the potential for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink, which will launch in Mexico in the fourth quarter and is coming to a digital markets next year, including the U.S. in the spring through our agreements with Brown-Forman. This will give consumers a convenient way to enjoy the world's most popular bar cooler. Our innovations are designed with scalability in mind to further support our growth portfolio.\nWe expect inflationary pressures to continue, so we are leveraging all the levers of RGM at our disposal, including price, promotional intelligence and proactive mix management. Our RGM capability is mining insights such as consumer motivations as well as category and customer opportunities, giving us a precise approach to package, placement and promotional investments. This drives trip conversion and value growth for customers.\nFor example, in Japan, we are seeing strong results from our segmented approach. Instead of our key 500 ml PET pack for Fanta, we now sell one smaller 350 ml PET pack for on-the-go and one larger 700 ml PET pack for home occasions. This dual-pack strategy has increased beverage incidence by 9%. In Q3, retail value transactions and market share were all up for these packages. Our system is investing to grow our executional footprint, adding to what was already pervasive distribution resulting in availability of our products in nearly 2/3 of all outlets globally. These strong results are clear proof points of what is possible when our alliance system leans forward for growth.\nUnderpinning all of this work is our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. Sustainability remains an integral part of our business and strategy and is a key driver of future growth and business resilience. While we have made progress towards our World Without Waste goals, we remain committed to do more and faster so we can grow our business the right way. We're continuing to partner with other businesses, civil society and governments to support cooperative action on this critical issue.\nDuring the quarter, we played a leadership role and helped launch the business coalition for a global plastics treaty convened by key partners, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and World Wildlife Fund, alongside other private sector companies. We are also continuing to take steps to help drive the circular economy by making our bottles more eco-friendly.\nIn North America and Latin America, Sprite has shifted all of its PET packaging from green to clear, improving the efficiency of recycling systems and increasing the availability of food-grade rPET. In Vietnam, we launched Coca-Cola bottles made from 100% recycled plastic, excluding the cap and the label. We now have more than 30 markets where we offer at least one brand in a 100% rPET package, with similar launches planned in additional markets next year.\nIn an operating environment that increasingly puts more variables into the equation than we've seen in the past, we are focused on delivering and executing for growth. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in the business. We are committed to expanding the circumference of what we can control by delivering world-class marketing, disciplined innovation, excellence in revenue growth management and laser-sharp execution in the marketplace, with a goal of operating at a higher level through these challenging market conditions.\nWe are doing this with capable and aligned bottling partners around the world. The combination of strong loved brands and a pervasive distribution system is a formula for resilience in times like these, and we are pleased to be raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nPresident & CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and provide considerations for our updated guidance to this year. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2023 and what actions we are taking to drive a top line-led growth equation to navigate this dynamic environment.\nWe are encouraged with the continued momentum of our business, and we delivered another set of strong results in the third quarter. We grew organic revenue 16%. Unit cases grew 4%, with broad-based growth across most operating segments and targeted investments in the marketplace. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Our price/mix of 12% was driven primarily by pricing actions across operating segments, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix.\nComparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 190 basis points versus the prior year. The underlying margin compression was approximately 60 basis points, with the rest of the impact coming from currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. We significantly stepped up our consumer and customer-facing investments to support our robust marketing agenda and strong innovation pipeline.\nNotwithstanding higher costs and continued investments in the marketplace, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 100 basis points, driven by strong top line growth. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 50 basis points due to the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Below the line, we benefited from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate for the full year. All in, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.69 grew 7% year-over-year, and this was impacted by 11 points of currency headwinds.\nOn cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $7.3 billion year-to-date driven by our strong business performance. This was 14% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 1.8x EBITDA, which is slightly below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\nAs we look to the operating environment, there are clearly many variables at play today, as James mentioned. We are spinning our top line and bottom line flywheels faster to fortify our business and manage through many types of environments, and we're investing in the marketplace to create value for our customers and consumers. Given our strong results and the visibility we have for the rest of the year, we are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 15% to 16%.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a 7-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19% in 2022. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 6% to 7% versus 2021. We continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022, through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less about $1.5 million in capital investments.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind for Q4 that we factored into our full year guidance. There is an additional day in the fourth quarter, however, we expect concentrate sales to end the year in line with unit case sales. We are investing in consumer-facing marketing to get a fast start for next year. Lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. The environment remains volatile, and while we are preparing for many futures in 2023, we did want to share some early considerations for next year based on what we know today.\nWe are encouraged by the momentum in our top line and we leverage our capabilities to sustain top line growth with the ongoing inflationary backdrop. As we look to our cost outlook, we expect global inflation to continue to impact our expenses across the board and commodities to remain volatile. We benefited from hedges in our commodity exposure this year. And even though some of the commodities have started to come off their highs, we expect another year of elevated inflation on a per case basis next year.\nWe estimate the underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate 5- to 6-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 7- to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. However, given the amount of volatility in the currency markets, this initial view could change when we come back to you for the fourth quarter call in February.\nWe are committed to delivering top line-led growth, and we remain focused and confident in our ability to achieve our 3 key objectives: investing for the long-term health of the business; winning locally; and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. We are pleased with our results so far and have the visibility to deliver on our updated guidance, creating value for our shareowners through strong top line growth, cash flow generation and dividend growth. Our strong system leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people around the world gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results in the year ahead.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions) I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\n\nTimothy K. Leveridge\n\nVP & IR Officer, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer.\nNote that we've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins.\nIn addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports.\nFollowing prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nNow I'll turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nChairman & CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered strong performance by continuing to execute on our growth strategy. Our industry remained robust, and we gained both volume and value share in the quarter.\nOur first half 2022 results and the resiliency of our business give us confidence to raise our top line guidance. This is offsetting the meaningful increases in costs and currency headwinds to hold our bottom line U.S. dollar outlook of 5% to 6% growth, even as we accelerate investments in our business to drive future growth. These results are enabled by our organization's purpose-led culture, strong alignment with our bottling partners and the dedication and flexibility of our people while driving our growth agenda.\nThis morning, I'll discuss the current operating environment and how we're delivering results and building for the future in that environment and the progress on our sustainability agenda. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we are building resilience to manage through external factors worldwide.\nDuring the second quarter, the operating environment continued to be asynchronous with many moving parts. Some regions continued to experience broad-based macro strength while others are experiencing strong inflationary pressures. Some countries are still recovering from the pandemic, while China experienced pandemic-related lockdowns. And the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and we'd like to send our thoughts and deepest sympathies to all of those who continue to be affected.\nWith this as a backdrop, we have managed well with our bottlers and delivered robust revenue growth across all our geographic segments that encompass strong pricing actions and strong volume performance helped by away-from-home recovery. Consumer elasticities have largely held a better-than-expected year-to-date, though we are watching closely for signs of changing consumer behavior as the year goes on and as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up.\nWe expect the consumer environment to be more challenging, and we are preparing accordingly, stepping up our investments, sharpening our resource allocation capabilities and tapping into data to better reach our consumers. We also recognize that the dollar strength is impacting our translated earnings, and we remain committed to delivering U.S. dollar growth.\nAs a system, we are focusing on expanding the circumference of what we can control, understanding and providing what consumers want, ultimately giving them more reasons to choose our great brands and driving value for our consumers, our customers and the industry.\nNow recapping our Q2 performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we delivered our best-ever quarter volumetrically and added 1 billion incremental transactions in the quarter, led by affordable single-serve packs. We gained share in sparkling soft drinks and juices, and our system is continuing to invest in the marketplace availability and execution to capture growth.\nJapan made progress in recovery, and we gained share in consumers year-to-date versus 2019. Additionally, we gained 7 points of share of visible inventory, driven by coffee and tea in the ambience space. We continue to have a strong innovation pipeline with the launch of Ayataka hojicha latte, non-alcohol Lemon-Dou Yowanai and Georgia Latte Nista.\nPerformance in China was under pressure, driven by COVID lockdowns. Volume was down for all months in the quarter, but the team persevered through a challenging environment, and recovery began in June as most restrictions started to lift. We focused on the core, prioritized top SKUs and reallocated resources to digital engagement, e-commerce and O2O as consumer demand shifted to at-home consumption.\nIn ASEAN and South Pacific, macro fundamentals remained strong despite ongoing supply chain headwinds. We added new consumers, and transactions grew ahead of volume. We invested in consumer-facing marketing and improvement in execution and increased distribution across key entry packs and multipacks.\nTurning to EMEA. Europe saw strong volume performance, leading to value share gains across total NARTD and online. Strong marketing campaigns, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Zero Words, Walk The Fanta 3.0 and Sprite's screen time messaging are tying our beverages to more consumption occasions with better results.\nIn Africa, we delivered strong performance that translated into NARTD volume and value share gains. We continue to focus on stills, affordability and in-market execution.\nDigital initiatives remained strong and gross merchandise value of our eB2B marketplace businesses were up approximately 50% sequentially. We accelerated cooler placement, reduced retail out of stocks and continued building RGM capability across markets.\nIn Eurasia and Middle East, amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment, the industry is growing, and the recovery of the on-premise channel is driving our growth. Through the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, we leveraged the iconic Coca-Cola trademark to generate significant media traction across the markets.\nTurning to North America. We gained both volume and value share through the strength of our brands despite navigating a challenging supply chain, including higher labor and freight costs. We continue to drive mix improvement in sparkling soft drinks and more than doubled mini can availability on display. New product innovations, including Coke Starlight, Fanta Dragon Fruit Zero Sugar and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas are showing promising early results. We're continuing to work closely with our bottling partners to accelerate overall commercial execution.\nTurning to Latin America. We leveraged compelling occasion-based marketing campaigns and execution in the marketplace, and our share losses improved sequentially. Coca-Cola trademark focus on building meals and breaks rituals under the Real Magic platform with returnable packages as the main enabler, while in juice and dairy, we're focused on everyday meals occasions. Our flavored alcohol beverage business is growing strongly. We're gaining share in the direct-to-consumer business and now reaching approximately 6.3 million consumers via digital channels.\nIn Global Ventures, the cost of retail business was under pressure as footfall in the U.K. stayed below 2019 levels. However, the Costa Express platform remained robust, and the launch of the new Frappé range in the U.K. drove growth.\nFinally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong top line performance, driven by a focus on recruitment through affordable entry packs, including a relaunch of returnable glass bottles in India. Additionally, we saw continued sparkling soft drink share gains versus 2019 in the Philippines and Vietnam.\nWhile the macro environment is still asynchronous around the world, we're operating in an industry with a relatively predictable pattern of growth and attractive growth potential over the long term. So we're investing in our business and are anticipating the many futures as they come at us.\nWe have managed a broad-based recovery coming out of the pandemic. Our 5-year average organic revenue growth rate is at the top end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%, which is a proof point of our transformed and strengthened organization. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on raising the bar on the elements of our flywheels for top line growth and, as I said earlier, expand the circumference of what we can control, namely through building our strong portfolio of loved brands, excellence in revenue growth management and the power of our system execution.\nWe're making targeted investments to unlock our growth agenda. We've built capabilities in brand building, innovation, RGM and execution, leveraging the power of scale while still being locally relevant to consumers. These investments enable us to win not only in today's environment but continue to build our business for the long term.\nOur new marketing model is focused on adding and retaining consumers. And we're doing this through an ecosystem of experiences that link consumption occasions with consumer passion points. The launch of the global Magic Weekends campaign with trademark Coke, in partnership with more than 20 food service aggregators, is showing great results. This campaign engages consumers at key moments from gaming to music to meal times. We are seeing 3.5x redemption levels for Coca-Cola combo meals versus pre-campaign levels and a 50% lift in outlets with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar availability.\nWe also launched end-to-end digital-first brand campaigns for smartwater and vitaminwater, the snackable video content on social platforms for smartwater with global icon, Zendaya, and the launch of vitaminwater Lil Nas X partnership on TikTok is a different engagement approach to marketing that is already delivering strong results across channels. With new faces and new platforms for some of our billion-dollar brands, we are creating excitement and recruiting a new generation of drinkers.\nWe continue to strengthen our RGM capabilities, which allows us to drive value for our consumers and our customers. RGM allows us to better navigate a dynamic consumer and retail environment, using effective tools such as price and promotional intelligence to leverage the power of our brands, proactive mix management and premiumization and addressing affordability to drive recruitment and keep value-conscious consumers. We work to bring these elements to life at a local level with our bottling partners.\nFor example, in India, we focus on segmented pricing, increasing prices on multiserves and premium packs while holding transaction-driving price points in single-serve and the affordable portfolio. Additionally, we reached our highest-ever outlet availability and drove a 4-point increase in single-serve availability and a 6-point increase in affordable pack availability.\nIn Europe, our system implemented several affordability and premiumization initiatives. We drove strong transaction and volume growth through initiatives like incentivizing multipacks to drive value on a price-per-ounce basis for consumers and driving single-serve packages like cans and returnable glass bottles in HORECA channels. By keeping transaction-driving price points in play, we expanded our consumer base with sparkling soft drinks in the region year-to-date.\nWe're building consumer-centric loved brands and products, and our improving excellence in execution extends to building a more sustainable future for our business and the planet. During the quarter, we released our fourth World Without Waste Report, which provides an update on our ambitious sustainable packaging initiatives. It showcases how we are using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale.\nOur operating units are further integrating sustainable practices into the business to drive growth. For example, in the United States, we are executing a set of initiatives to help solve the plastic waste problem. We recently joined industry groups, including the Consumer Goods Forum and the American Beverage Association, to support our model extended producer responsibility bill in Colorado. This is in addition to the support we provided for well-designed minimum-recycled content legislation in 3 states. These have now been enacted into law.\nCurrently, 20-ounce bottles for Coca-Cola Trademark and the standard in California, Texas, New York and throughout the Northeast are in 100% recycled PET. In 2021, we launched a bold label clearly communicating that the bottles, excluding the caps and labels, are made from 100% recycled content, which is driving strong performance in the marketplace. Later this month, we will expand our use of 100% recycled PET throughout the U.S. and Canada.\nEvery part of our business understands how their actions impact the company's wider sustainability goals, and we continue to make progress.\nTo sum up, we are continuing to navigate a confluence of macroeconomic factors and our networked organization is embracing the resilience to weather many environments. Guided by our purpose and with the right strategy through our portfolio and the right execution capabilities, we are confident about delivering top line growth for now and the long term.\nBefore I turn the call over to John, I want to congratulate him for assuming the role of President beginning October 1, in addition to his current responsibility as CFO. And of course, I also want to thank Brian Smith for his service and innumerable contributions to the system during his 25-year tenure with the company and wish him all the best for the future.\nSo John, over to you.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly touch on the drivers of our second quarter performance and the update to our full year 2022 guidance, then I'll provide commentary on building resilience in our business by investing behind our brands and driving top line led growth.\nWe're pleased with the continued momentum of our business around the world. This has translated into strong top line and comparable EPS growth, notwithstanding the larger-than-expected currency headwinds and increased cost pressures. We delivered organic revenue growth of 16%. Unit cases grew 8% with broad-based growth across all operating segments. Concentrate sales were behind unit cases by 4 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and our Europe, Middle East and Africa Group.\nOur price/mix of 12% was primarily driven by strategic pricing actions across markets, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix.\nComparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 3 items: one, an upsized increase in costs in the business due to the inflationary environment; two, currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop; and three, the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business.\nOn the marketing front, we increased our consumer and customer-facing spending to create more value for our brands and continue to earn their respective price points. Despite increased investments and costs throughout the P&L, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 40 basis points, driven by a higher return from our investments in the marketplace. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 110 basis points due to the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds.\nPutting this all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.70 grew 4% year-over-year. And this was impacted by 9 points of currency headwinds, 5 points higher than what we'd anticipated when we last gave guidance.\nOn cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $4.1 billion year-to-date, driven by our strong business performance. This was 20% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 2.1x EBITDA, which is within the targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\nAs we look at the operating environment and the resilience consumers have shown thus far, we are watching closely for signs that indicate this may change. We remain ready to adapt. We're using a dynamic resource allocation framework to ensure our investments are directed towards country category combinations that drive the highest growth, thereby maximizing our returns. And we are working closely with our bottling partners to effectively navigate whatever comes our way.\nWith this backdrop, this morning, we are raising our top line and currency-neutral EPS guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of 12% to 13% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be a 6-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022. And all in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments.\nThere are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022 that we factored into our guidance. While our shipments are currently behind unit cases, we expect these to run in line for the full year with the catch-up expected in the fourth quarter. We now expect that the direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia will be approximately $0.03 to comparable EPS.\nBased on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect commodity price inflation to move to a high single-digit impact from mid-single digits on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. This is primarily due to commodity cost increases across our concentrate and finished goods businesses.\nOther costs, including wages, transportation, media and operating expenses, are also increasing and adding incremental pressures. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our Vietnam and Cambodia bottling operations.\nAnd lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our exposure to floating rate debt.\nAs we enter the second half of the year, we continue to raise the bar in every aspect of how we do business. And we feel confident in our ability to effectively navigate this dynamic global environment and deliver on our updated guidance for 2022. Along with our bottling partners, we remain focused on the compelling growth opportunity our industry offers, and we are investing and creating flexibility in the business by taking actions on those things within our control.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions)\nI would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\n\nTimothy K. Leveridge\n\nVP & IR Officer, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer.\nNote that we posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins.\nIn addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports.\nFollowing prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nNow I'll turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nChairman & CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what's happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support.\nNow this morning, I'll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner.\nWe all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy and the right execution in the marketplace.\nAfter a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we've consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility acquisitions changed to generate strong top and bottom line growth in the quarter.\nWe delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in at-home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions. Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach.\nAmidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system continues to be rebuilded to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands.\nAdditionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world.\nSo let's start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility have improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers. We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory.\nJapan is emerging from the extended state of emergency, and we've increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke On app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for 5 key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee.\nIn China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns. And this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We're moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability. We're adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we're working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open.\nIn ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the Zero Words, Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns.\nIn EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter. The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive 5 percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels.\nTopo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the #1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with MyCCEP.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt.\nIn Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remained challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea.\nIn Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the #2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings.\nIn North America, we are seeing more inflation and are continuing to navigate supply chain dynamics. We're closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point.\nPOWERADE (inaudible) launched during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions. We also continued to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest.\nIn Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth. Our work to strengthen the traditional trade is paying off as the channel showed the best underlying performance across all channels.\nThe Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth.\nWithin Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the U.K., Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express. In China, while retail sales were impacted by store closures due to the pandemic, Costa ready-to-drink coffee sustained its #2 position and continue to innovate with Costa Cha.\nFinally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress towards optimizing trade promotions and Costa serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence.\nClearly, the operating environment is proven to be more challenging, but we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter. We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amidst the increasingly inflationary environment; accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future.\nThe multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage. Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price.\nBy extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability.\nIn North America, we're maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering 6 packs, 10 packs and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and then near 20% increase in total distribution points.\nOur networked organization structure extends our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they have put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities.\nWith our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI and the UN Global Compact.\nIn the report, we highlight how we and our bottling partners are driving business growth through our interconnected ESG goals and how we continue to seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action, partnering across industry, government and society to address shared challenges.\nIn conclusion, while there is no doubt the world is more uncertain and the operating environment remains highly dynamic, our strategy remains the same: to execute for sustainable growth through strengthened capabilities in innovation, marketing, RGM and execution.\nNow I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I'll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results.\nLet me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by 3 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA. Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix.\nComparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 2 items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L.\nComparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year-over-year. This was driven by strong top line growth, which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds.\nOn the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x.\nAs James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market. The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous.\nObviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we're confident in the flexibility we've built and our ability to manage what's around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth.\nWith that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a 2- to 3-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a 3- to 4-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022.\nAdditionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments.\nTo put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS. The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins.\nWhen it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year.\nDespite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands. This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022.\nAnd with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Now I'll turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Robert B. Quincey\n\nChairman & CEO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to reflect on the past year and how we've emerged stronger from the pandemic, including positive performance in the fourth quarter. I'll also highlight the broader macro environment and how we're executing in the marketplace. Finally, I'll touch briefly on the accelerators for growth that give us confidence we can achieve the 2022 guidance we've provided today, with more on them to come at CAGNY later this month. John will then discuss financial results for the quarter and our outlook in more detail.\nBut before I get to it, I'd like to acknowledge that our ability to emerge stronger would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees and system partners around the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work, their contribution not only to our results, but to our curious, empowered, inclusive and agile culture.\nIn 2021, the operating environment remained dynamic as the pandemic continued to evolve and factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions brought additional challenges. But over the year, our organization and the system continued to manage through these circumstances with focus and flexibility. We are pleased with the results, which were above 2019 across key metrics, and we remain focused on building a stronger total beverage company.\nNow looking more closely at our fourth quarter results. We saw another quarter of sequential improvement versus 2019, and we ended the year with volume ahead of 2019. Notably, it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was also ahead of 2019 while at-home channels remained strong.\nSo recapping the quarter 4 performance around the world, starting with Asia Pacific. China delivered strong performance in the quarter by capturing a growing trend among consumers' 0-calorie offerings, we doubled our Zero Sugar sparkling portfolio in terms of volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We leveraged RGM strategies and targeting investments to gain share in e-commerce, thus driving growth for the overall business.\nIn India, initiatives to build omnichannel presence and marketing campaigns around key occasions by leveraging festivals and passion points through occasion-led marketing and integrated execution drove a sequential increase in market share and nearly 30% growth in transactions for the quarter. Additionally, our local Thums Up brand became $1 billion brand in India, driven by focused marketing and execution plans.\nIn Japan, while our system was faced with a very challenging year, we gained value share and consumers driven by successful innovation and commercial strategies.\nIn ASEAN and South Pacific, there were strict restrictions and limited reopenings in many markets for a large part of the year. In Q4, acceleration of vaccine efforts and strong results from the Fanta Colorful People and Sprite Make it Clear campaigns helped drive our recovery.\nIn EMEA, volume in Europe in the quarter surpassed 2019 despite mobility restrictions, particularly in Western Europe. Despite the recovery remaining asynchronous in the region, increased investments behind our brands in the marketplace resulted in our system driving the highest incremental retail value among FMCG players in the region.\nIn Africa, volume continued to be ahead of 2019 in the fourth quarter, driven by our key markets with strong double-digit growth in Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, increased investments behind our affordability and multi-serve packages drove value share for the full year above 2019 in the region.\nIn Eurasia and Middle East, the top line continued to expand faster than the macro environment, driven by strong revenue growth management, execution and digital capabilities. Turkey, one of our key markets, grew 7 points of value share for the year in digital as total digital commerce expanded by close to 90%.\nIn North America, despite COVID cases leading to business closings and some mobility restrictions, value share growth was strong in the quarter, driven by pricing, revenue growth management and strong execution in the market. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to deliver strong results, outpacing category growth, while Sprite and smartwater grew drinker base and buy rates. Innovations also delivered strong performances, led by Coke with Coffee and Simply Almond.\nLatin America delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit volume growth versus 2019. This resilience of the system has been driven by years of experience navigating volatile environments through strong and effective execution.\nWithin Global Ventures, Costa continued to recover through the year but was impacted in Q4 due to COVID-related restrictions. Costa Express continued its strong performance in the U.K., delivering results ahead of expectations. In China, the Costa ready-to-drink expansion continued with availability now in more than 300,000 outlets, continuing to drive our share position ahead of our key competitor.\nFinally, our Bottling Investment Group continues to focus on productivity and transformation initiatives, delivering strong operating margin expansion for full year 2021.\nDue to improved mobility throughout the year, our industry is growing in both volume and value. Gaining share was a key objective in our Emerging Stronger agenda. And this year, we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Our NARTD market share is above 2019 levels at a global level and in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We will continue to identify and address opportunities to further improve our value share, driven by data-backed insights.\nAs we close the chapter on 2021, we emerge stronger by delivering both top line and EPS ahead of 2019, and we gained share in a growing industry. The actions we took during the pandemic have resulted in an agile, a focused organization that is poised to capture the sizable opportunities that exist. And we continue to look to the future to build on our momentum and drive growth.\nAs we turn to 2022, while it is impossible for us to know whether this variant will be the last, what is clear is that our consumers, our customers and our business are learning and adapting with great resilience. For example, while we have seen some impacts from the Omicron variant through the first few weeks of the year, we are not seeing the same level of disruption as previous waves, and our system is better equipped.\nFurther recovery in 2022 will be determined by macro factors, including overall consumer sentiment as well as supply chain challenges; labor shortages; and of course, the inflationary pressures and interest rates. We are confident we are well equipped to navigate this environment and deliver on the guidance we provided today.\nNow I'll touch on some of the capabilities we've built to unlock the next stage of growth and will elaborate more at our virtual CAGNY presentation later this month.\nWe're excited about where we are today and the substantial initiatives we have in place for 2022. The consumer continues to be at the center of our strategy. And through our total beverage company agenda, we are adapting to the macro and micro trends which are shaping consumer habits.\nWe advanced our total beverage company agenda last year by streamlining our portfolio, focusing on the core and investing behind a portfolio of brands that allows us to meet the evolving needs of consumers. We completed much of this work on brand eliminations while being deliberate with brand transitions. This optimized portfolio will ensure we follow the consumer and win in emerging and fast-growing categories. And is complemented by the recent strategic acquisition of BODYARMOR; as well as relationships like the new agreement with Constellation Brands, which will launch Fresca Mixed; and the extended relationship with Molson Coors, which will launched Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S.\nOur network marketing model, with global category teams and local operating units, is allowing us to focus on end-to-end consumer experiences that are data-driven and always on. Our announcement of WPP as our global marketing network partner is a foundational component of our new marketing model. This new agency approach gives us access to the best creative lines, regardless of source, and is underpinned by leading-edge data and technology capabilities.\nThe Real Magic campaign is the first campaign which was cocreated internally leveraging this new end-to-end approach. And the campaign is showing strong results with the consumers. We have good visibility into the benefits of the new marketing model. The approach will allow us to deliver best-in-class consumer-centric marketing experiences across our categories and around the world.\nWe also built more discipline into our innovation process in 2021 with a key focus on scalable bets that can build momentum year-over-year. It's still early, but the approach is working. Revenue per launch and gross profit per launch were up 30% and 25%, respectively, versus prior year. And we took intelligent local experiments and moved more rapidly to scale them across geographies. Sustainable packaging like refillables and labelless bottles, along with brands like Coke with Coffee, fairlife, AHA, Costa ready-to-drink and Lemondo, are all examples of local winners that have been extended to more markets.\nFor 2022, our innovation process is increasingly supported by data, and our pipeline is robust with built-in agility and consists of big bets along with many shots on goal.\nThe system has stepped up its RGM and execution capabilities, which is helping us navigate an inflationary environment, driving value growth in a segmented way. Due to the strength of our bottling partners and the stronger than ever alignment of the system, we are prepared to address opportunities as well as challenges that may lie ahead. Our network organizational structure is designed to better connect functions and operating units to help our system scale ideas faster.\nAs we've emerged stronger, we kept moving forward on integrating sustainability work into our business as it is a key driver of future growth. During the quarter, we were recognized for our commitment to transparency and action to address environmental risks by earning an A score in CDP's Assessment for Water, an improvement over last year. We improved or maintained our score in CDP's assessments on other important areas, like climate and forests.\nAdditionally, to complement our World Without Waste goals, we announced a new global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Increasing refillable and reusable packaging options responds to consumer affordability and our sustainability aspirations, and it helps create a circular economy as refillable packages have extremely high levels of collection and are low carbon footprint beverage containers.\nFinally, before I turn over to John, I want to say a big thank you and recognize our associates from both the company and our bottling partners, who worked with great dedication and unwavering commitment throughout another challenging year.\nWe expect the recovery will remain asynchronous, but we are encouraged by our growing industry, our unparalleled system strength and a strategic transformation that enables us to be agile and to adapt. Our actions drove strong results in 2021, and we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong performance in 2022 and over the long term.\nNow John will provide more details on our results and our 2020 guidance.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the Omicron variant across many parts of the world.\nOur Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%. Our price/mix of 10% was driven by a combination of factors, including targeted pricing, revenue growth management initiatives as well as further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a 2-year basis, and concentrate sales lagged unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to 6 fewer days in the quarter.\nDespite the commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022.\nWe continued to invest in markets as they recovered and stepped up year-over-year marketing dollars again in Q4, spending in a targeted way to maximize returns. This increase in marketing investments, along with some top line pressure from 6 fewer days in the quarter, resulted in comparable operating margin compression of approximately 500 basis points for the quarter.\nFor the full year, comparable operating margin was down approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as improved comparable gross margin was offset by the significant step-up in marketing. Importantly, versus 2019, a key measure we have focused on, comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points.\nPutting it all together. Fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.45 was a decline of 5% year-over-year, resulting in full year comparable earnings per share of $2.32, an increase of 19% versus the prior year, as the strong resurgence in the business also benefited from a 3-point tailwind from currency and tax.\nWe delivered strong free cash flow of $11.3 billion in 2021, with free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% and a dividend payout ratio well below our long-term target of 75%. With these results, we exceeded guidance on every metric for full year 2021. We have done tremendous work to emerge ahead of 2019 and set the stage to drive our growth agenda for years to come.\nWe are spinning the strategy flywheels faster and more effectively. Our organization is focused on execution and enhancing our capabilities to fuel growth. As James mentioned, the pandemic will be one of the many factors, along with the dynamic macro backdrop that we face in the coming year. But our local businesses are ready to adapt and execute for growth.\nWith that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2022 that builds our momentum from 2021. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8%, and we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3 point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022.\nAdditionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS. Therefore, all in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021, including the combined 5- to 6-point headwind from currency and tax.\nWe expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow over 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%. We continue to raise the performance bar across the organization and are confident in delivering on this 2022 guidance.\nIn summary, we expect to deliver another year of strong top line-driven growth, along with maximized returns, driven by the strategic changes we have made in our business.\nThere are several considerations to keep in mind for 2022. Overall, inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses.\nWith regards to commodity costs. After benefiting from our hedging strategy in 2021, we remain well hedged in 2022, but at higher levels. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect commodity price inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact.\nAs a reminder for your modeling, the consolidation of the recently acquired fast-growing BODYARMOR finished goods business will have a mechanical effect on margins.\nWhen it comes to capital allocation, our balance sheet remains strong, and our improving cash flow position is allowing us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of priorities that balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure, first and foremost, to invest in our business; secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend; thirdly, to seek opportune M&A; and to repurchase shares with excess cash. And finally, due to the calendar shift, there will be 1 less day in the first quarter and 1 additional day in the fourth quarter.\nDespite another year of uncertainty, in 2021, we came together as a system to emerge stronger and position ourselves to drive sustainable growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and are clear on the direction we're headed. As we look to 2022, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments we outlined today.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions.",

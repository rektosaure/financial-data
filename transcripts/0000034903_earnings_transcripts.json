[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Jill Sawyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJill Ryann Sawyer\n\nSenior Associate, Citigroup Inc, Research Division\n\nThank you, Megan. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Before we get started, a reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including items. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this morning, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and operational results. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I want to note that Don Wood, our Chief Executive Officer, is temporarily away due to a recent loss of an immediate family member. Our thoughts are with Don and his family during this very difficult time. In his absence, our Chief Investment Officer, Jan Sweetnam, will be reading Don's prepared remarks. In addition to Jan, joining me on the call today are Dan Guglielmone, Chief Financial Officer; Wendy Seher, Eastern Region President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as other members of our executive and senior leadership team, including Dawn Becker, Jeff Kreshek and Melissa Solis that are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jan Sweetnam. Jan, please begin.\n\nJan W. Sweetnam\n\nExecutive VP & President of Western Region, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Jill, and good morning, everybody. Following our Don's prepared remarks, best leasing quarter we've ever had, ever and that's saying something given the leasing strength over the past few years. 727,000 feet of comparable space written at $35.71 28% annual cash rent than the previous tenant. 2/3 of that space was for renewals with de minimis capital required. Of the remaining 1/3 related to new tenants over half related to space that is currently occupied but for which a more productive tenant executed a lease a year or 2 or even 3 early in order to lock it up. .\nThere's no better evidence of the attractiveness of a shopping center to retailers than that, and it's one of the best ways in our business to assure an increasing stream of cash flows well into the future. Wendy will talk about core leasing a bit more in a few minutes. Strong comparable operating income growth of 4.4% in the quarter was equally encouraging and led to FFO per share of $1.77, despite the absence of capitalized interest and operating costs at Santana West that negatively impacted FFO per share by $0.04. That drag will begin to dissipate in this fourth quarter and in 2026 and 2027 as tenants in the 90% leased, soon to be 95% leased, building continue to occupy and work through free rent periods.\nOperationally, this was a really strong quarter. And based on what we see thus far in October, should allow us to close out 2025 strong. In terms of development and redevelopment, residential construction in Hoboken, New Jersey and Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania are moving along nicely on or under budget and on time with leasing to begin in early 2026 at Bala Cynwyd. During the third quarter, we broke ground on 258 new residential units on the last surface parking lot at Santana Row of committing capital of roughly $145 million. Those 3 projects, Hoboken, Bala and Santana will require roughly $280 million of capital, all in fully amenitized and proven environments and should yield 6.5% to 7% unlevered. There's more to come in this component of our business in 2026.\nCurrent conditions suggest market value should be 150 to 200 basis points inside those returns. We're committed to realizing that value over time as we've demonstrated with the sale of Lavare at Santana Row earlier this year, Palace at Pike & Rose, which is currently under contract for sale and should close right around year-end and the current marketing of Misora at Santana Row. On the acquisition front, I really want to thank those of you that made the trip to Kansas City to join us for our investor tour of Town Center Crossing and Plaza in Leawood earlier this month, we're off to a great start there from a cash flow and value-enhancing perspective.\nAnd I just want to reemphasize the 2 points that I think became apparent to investors and analysts on that trip. First, that we are not sacrificing quality by expanding our geographical footprint. The growth prospects for these investments exceed both the retail and residential assets we're selling, and it is highly likely that the exit cap rates for the shopping centers we're pursuing will tighten considerably based upon our retenanting and redevelopment. And second, that this is not a change in strategy for federal. Our deep and experienced team is doing what it has always done. Lease it better, both from a merchandising and strength of lease contract standpoint, create a more inviting physical space that link in stay times and increases spend and intensify the land with more retail or residential GLA, where and whenever economically feasible. Same business plan and strategy just on different land with the same characteristics.\nThe affluent consumer is underserved, the centers are big and dominant and existing relevant tenants have proven that it's the place in the submarket to be. You might have also seen that we closed on the acquisition of Annapolis Town Center in the A+ location off State Route 50, which heads into DC and Interstate 97, which takes you to Baltimore in Annapolis, Maryland. We bought the property for $187 million at a 7% unlevered return with an anchor and shadow anchor foundation grounded by very successful retailers, Whole Foods, Lifetime Fitness and target we expect to be able to enhance the surrounding merchandising with better and more productive tenancy enabling higher rents.\nWe're very excited about this addition in our core market. Next up is another large and dominant center and a growing Midwestern submarket that we expect to close in this fourth quarter. More to come on that one soon. So that's about it from my prepared remarks. Enhanced internal and external growth using all the tools at our disposal is the name of the game. Quarters like this sort of 2025 increased my confidence in doing so. Let me now turn it over to Wendy to expand on the leasing environment.\n\nWendy A. Seher\n\nExecutive VP & Eastern Region President, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Jan, and good morning, everybody. Exceptional performance for the quarter, highlighted by record leasing volumes that build significant forward momentum as we conclude the year and look ahead to 2026. As reflected in Don's comments, we successfully recorded a record 123 comparable deals at impressive rent spreads of 28% over in-place prior rents. Our operational metrics are in top form, evidenced by strong occupancy, healthy margins and reduced controllable expenses all underscoring a solid financial performance. Outstanding results overall for the quarter. .\nOccupancy in the comparable pool continues to show momentum as our occupied rate climbed 40 basis points last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 94%. On an overall occupancy basis, including all of our shopping centers, we stand at 93.8% today. Keep in mind, our 2 recent acquisitions, Leawood and Annapolis were roughly 91% and 85% occupied at closing, therefore, impacting total overall occupancy as we head into the fourth quarter. We encourage investors to focus on our comparable occupancy metrics, which more accurately reflects the continued strength and momentum across the core portfolio. Turning to our lease rate. Our comparable lease rate stands at a very healthy 95.7%. We expect the figure to grow and show positive momentum into year-end driven by a strong pipeline, including over 175,000 square feet of new leases currently in process for vacant space.\nThis represents roughly 70 basis points of incremental lease rate opportunity. While the third quarter saw record leasing volume, a significant portion of this activity was for space, which currently was occupied. This is a testament to the durability of the centers and reinforces future stability in our occupancy metrics, providing embedded growth even if it doesn't immediately lift the recorded rate. By pre-leasing space, we effectively reduced downtime, we smooth out quarter-to-quarter revenue and strengthen occupancy over time. This proactive approach is a major focus across our operating teams. We continue to see broad-based demand for our quality real estate with a variety of best-in-class names and categories such as Chopped, allow Burlington, RHouse and Ross to name a few, and we continue to upgrade our retail lineup, including within our more recent acquisitions, Virginia Gateway, Pembrook and Leawood to be specific which with names such as Coach and LEGO, Warby Parker and Blueberry.\nWe were able to drive rents and earn a return on our capital at. Merchandising and retail sales performance is our focus. LoveShackFancy just had their grand opening this past weekend at the Grove at Shrewsbury attracted by the addition of our small-format Bloomie's concept, LoveShackFancy opened to a line out the door and had their best opening ever of their 25 locations. Merchandising matters in non-commodity centers. Our acquisition of Minneapolis Town Center this quarter is a prime example of our disciplined acquisition strategy. 479,000 square foot mixed-use retail properties confirms our focus on acquiring high-quality dominant centers in affluent markets.\nWith an 85% current occupancy rate, we expect the addition of Annapolis to provide meaningful growth with strong existing anchors like Whole Foods, Target and lifetime and featuring popular retail brands such as Sephora, RH, Pottery Barn and Anthropology, a perfect addition to our Maryland portfolio. Expect us to provide a number of tenant announcements for Annapolis on our next call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Wendy, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share for the third quarter of $1.77 above consensus and at the top end of our guidance range of $172 million to $177 million. Comparable POI growth for the quarter was 4.4% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% on a cash basis. Both metrics outperformed our expectations, primarily due to higher-than-forecasted revenues in retail, residential and parking. As a result, we will increase guidance for both 2025 FFO per share and comparable POI growth.\nMore to come on that later in my prepared remarks. But first, an update on the balance sheet. We continue to have significant liquidity of approximately $1.3 billion at quarter end, comprised of availability on our $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility and over $100 million of cash at quarter end, committed active capital allocation program, our balance sheet remains strong. Third quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA is solid and stands at 5.6x, reflecting the purchase of the Leawood assets and our fixed charge coverage stood at 3.9x. We continue to look to execute on our capital recycling program. With $400 million of assets at various stages in the asset sale process, with roughly $200 million expected to close by year-end or shortly thereafter, and another $200-plus million forecasted to close in the first half of 2026.\nBehind that, we have a pool of over $1 billion of noncore assets under consideration to be brought to market in 2026 and beyond. Of that total, roughly $1.5 billion pool, about 1/3 is peripherally located residential with the other 2/3 being noncore retail. With estimated blended yields targeted in the mid- to upper 5% cap rate range and blended unlevered IRRs inside of 7, very attractively priced capital. While leverage may fluctuate modestly from quarter-to-quarter, given the inherent timing differences between acquisition and sale transactions, we expect to maintain a long-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the low to mid-5x range. From a flexibility perspective, with leverage metrics where they are and over $1.5 billion of asset sales in process and under consideration, we are very well positioned to continue to be on offense with respect to capital deployment.\nNow on to guidance. As mentioned earlier, with a third consecutive beat and raise, we are raising our forecasted range -- FFO per share, excluding the new market tax credit work into a recurring FFO to $7.05 to $7.11. This represents about 4.6% growth on this recurring basis at the midpoint over 2024 and roughly 4% to 5% at the low and high end of range, respectively. Including the onetime new market tax credits in these figures, our near redefined FFO range increases to $7.20 to $7.26, which represents 6.8% growth at the midpoint over 2024. This increase is driven by $0.01 of net operating outperformance during the quarter and roughly $0.01 accretion from the Annapolis acquisition for the quarter, which translates to $0.03 to $0.04 on an annualized basis.\nGiven another strong result for 3Q, we are increasing our forecast for 2025 comparable POI growth to 3.5% to 4% or 3.75% at the midpoint. And that's 4% when excluding prior period rent and term fees. We expect comparable occupied levels to be in the low 94s by year-end, given the deals signed to date the continued robust pipeline of leasing activity, which continues to have momentum even after a record third quarter volumes. Retail tenant demand for our portfolio is showing no signs of abating to date. We do have 1 other acquisition that we have under contract that should close before year-end of roughly $150 million. Although given the expected closing late in the quarter, we do not expect it to materially add to 2025 FFO.\nOne thing to keep in mind, the acquisitions we have completed so far this year, including the 1 currently under contract will total over $750 million have a blended initial cash yield of roughly 7%, a GAAP yield north of 7% and initial blended occupied rate of just 88%. These are high-quality assets with clear leasing upside, which will enhance growth in 2026, '27 and beyond. Implied FFO guidance for fourth quarter 2025 is $1.82 to $1.88 and represents 7% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. While we won't be providing formal 2026 guidance until our fourth quarter call in February, we do expect a strong year operationally. We're executing from a position of strength, we're investing strategically maintaining balance sheet discipline and setting ourselves up for another year of meaningful growth ahead.\nBefore I hand the call back to the operator, given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to 1 question during this segment of the call. And please, no multipart questions. You have additional questions, please requeue. And given the really tough news that Jill shared earlier, we completely understand that many of you may want to send a message of support to Don and his family. However, we respectfully ask that you refrain from expressing condolences on this call. So we can focus on the discussion on Federal Realty and its third quarter results and keep the Q&A segment of the call as efficient as possible. Thank you. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood.\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nWell, thank you, Jill, and good afternoon, everybody. It was a really active quarter led by Beat and raise results near record leasing, a big and important acquisition a couple of fully priced dispositions and some innovative and value-enhancing deal making. First, the quarter. Reported FFO per share of $1.91, includes $0.15 associated with our development of Freedom Plaza Shopping Center in Los Angeles as all the conditions necessary to recognize the new market tax credit income that we previously discussed have been satisfied.\nWhether or not you include or exclude the income in your modeling, please understand that this heavily negotiated deal derisked the development significantly went a long way to ensuring its profitability to a return that was enhanced by over 20%. Excluding the tax credit impact, FFO with $1.76 per share exceeded consensus and prior year FFO, resulting in the beat and raise that Dan will discuss in a few minutes.\nComparable property level operating income grew roughly 5% in the second quarter excluding tax credit by the way, while comparable retail leasing of 644,000 square feet was very near an all-time quarterly record. TI dollars remained under control and continue to benefit from the favorable supply-demand dynamics for high-quality retail real estate.\nThis is a really good quarter, strong quarter with good visibility of that strength continuing through the rest of the year. Now, Wendy is going to speak about our Leawood Kansas acquisitions in a few minutes, but let me first make some clarifying comments about our strategy. Our acquisition strategy, our disposition strategy and our development strategy.\nFirst, acquisitions. Our acquisition criteria leans into all of our core strengths developed over the last couple of decades. Big, dominant and I do mean dominant retail properties of the highest quality that sit on large parcels and affluent submarkets where our tenant relationships and redevelopment skills can make a significant difference in the property's growth rate. Every property we acquire has to be in a bull's-eye location measured by income demos, trade area reach, retailer desirability and economic constraints that assure retains its best location status protected from new supply.\nThe only change we're making to this criteria relates to geography, not quality. The playing field that we're exploring is wider, similar to the way we expanded into Arizona a few years back. Believe that we've been needlessly limiting our acquisition purview since COVID. Our tenants have told us that. Our core competencies of improved tenant selection, smart place making, selective redevelopment and site intensification are really needed and valued in places like Leawood, and retailers are ready to join us as space becomes available.\nTurns out that the Leawood, Kansas Shopper is simply not very different from the Pike & Rose Maryland shopper, except that they don't have nearly the retailer choices that the high-quality coastal properties do. We intend to change that. Since publicizing our interest in an expanded playing field, our inbound inquiries from sellers and brokers in markets and submarkets with characteristics similar to Leawood has increased substantially. We hope to have 2 more acquisitions of size completed by year-end.\nThere will be no diminution in the quality of Federal's portfolio as a result of the wider playing field. In fact, it will be enhanced with a laser-like focus on greater growth prospects and greater geographic diversity. The position of privilege to be selective in this environment, and we're able to do that because of the reputation and quality of our platform.\nNext is our disposition strategy, candidates for which fall into 2 camps. First, a pruning of assets that we simply see as limiting our long-term growth potential. It's why we sold our Hollywood Boulevard retail portfolio in June for $69 million and are sheltering the gain through a 1031 exchange with the Del Monte Shopping Center acquisition made earlier in the year. It's why we sold our Santa Monica assets late last year. That sale evaluation process will continue with a specific goal of improving our growth profile.\nAlso considered for disposition are certain assets that are a unique byproduct, the Federal's business plan. Those are buildings either residential or office generally, that are peripheral to our shopping centers and mixed-use communities, but that have top of the market valuations because of the adjacent retail environment that we've created over many years.\nNow I want to pause here and clarify what we mean by peripheral or stand-alone, residential and office assets. There are assets that, while part of our broader shopping center and mixed-use communities, are not integrated into the core retail amenity base, which drive our mixed-use strategy. We, therefore, believe that the sale of carefully selected locationally peripheral assets does not hurt the value of the larger shopping center or mixed-use community.\nWe've included a couple of simple site plan visuals linked to the earnings release and available on our IR site that illustrate what it is that we mean here. It's why we sold Lavare at Santana Row, a high-quality stand-alone residential asset that sits a block off the row on the periphery of the neighborhood. Lavare has no retail beneath it and was sold for $74 million in June at a sub-5 cap.\nAcross from it, you'll see the larger residential building that we call Misora, similar situation, and we plan to market it for sale in the coming months. At Pike & Rose, that can mean Palace the stand-alone luxury residential building, 1 bought behind the main shopping street and a Congressional Plaza shopping center where we have the stories apartments that sit behind it, we can also sell those. These are all high-quality assets that we've built over the last 25 years that are ripe for monetization without disrupting the productivity or the valuation of the core mixed-use environments we've created.\nThe same logic applies to select office assets, where widespread return to office mandates are rewarding the most highly amenitized product. Now the timing for monetizing this peripheral office product is probably not right yet, but we're open to recycling that capital here with the right buyer in valuation when the time comes. The luxury of having this optionality is a unique ace in the hole of ours and it's a testament to our high-quality and differentiated portfolio.\nAnd finally, our development strategy. Development remains an important core competency of our company. in a way to extract maximum value from our larger shopping center and mixed-use properties. And of course, opportunities are not as robust as they were in a lower interest rate environment, and pivot to acquisitions. But they will be again, in the meantime, we're still finding opportunities to add accretion and value largely with residential development as their historically lower exit cap rates, make the economics work.\nWe are very willing to opportunistically monetize peripheral residential assets that we develop once they're stabilized in order to redeploy that low-cost capital into new retail raw material. Expect to see our residential project in Bala Kenwood, Pennsylvania start leasing up next year in 2026 and Hoboken, New Jersey in 2027. We just broke ground on 258 apartments on Lot 12 in Santana Row in the first new residential project there in a decade, for which leasing will start in 2028. These projects represent just a part of our future growth pipeline with thousands more residential entitlements already banked or moving through the process.\nWe've heard investor concerns loud and clear, and I hope that my prepared remarks today are a start to clarifying the communication of our strategy. We couldn't be more excited to further execute on it through the power of Federal Realty's stellar reputation with all sorts of retailers as well as potential sellers and their representatives of some powerful and dominant shopping centers. Our goal is to deliver enhanced growth through the inevitable economic cycles will all face and what I continue to believe is the highest-quality retail-centric portfolio in the business.\nI think I'll stop there. And with that, turn it over to Wendy and then Dan for the on-the-ground detail.\n\nWendy A. Seher\n\nExecutive VP & Eastern Region President, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Don. Exceptional operating results were achieved on all fronts in the second quarter. As I mentioned on my last call, I anticipated leasing to be strong heading into 2Q, but the volume outpaced even my own expectations. 119 comparable deals totaling 644,000 square feet; second highest volume of leasing ever recorded just shy of our highest record in the fourth quarter of '24. Rent spreads were a solid 10% over in-place rents and 21% on a straight-line basis. We have been able to increase both our leased and occupied rates year-over-year as a result of limited exposure to recent bankruptcy headlines.\nOur embedded mark-to-market on the limited bankruptcy exposure we do have is roughly 30% to 35% on a handful of spaces. We have pending deals on all of these spaces and should be executing leases over the next few quarters. I continue to be bullish on the leasing demand as they look at our pipeline, which is roughly a robust 1.5 million square feet at rent spreads in the mid-teens.\nRetailers remain very focused on best-in-class locations with high disposable income and proven sales performance which is why I'm particularly excited about the addition of Town Center Plaza and Town Center Crossing in Kansas City. These centers meet all of our disciplined real estate criteria critical mass totaling 550,000 square feet, #1 dominant retail intersection located in affluent Leawood, Kansas.\nThe demographic speed volumes with medium household income of $180,000 in Leawood, placing this market on par with the strongest markets we operate in currently. Annual foot traffic puts this acquisition in the top 15 percentile of our portfolio on the top 2% of all shopping centers in the U.S. for Placer AI. The centers already boasting -- the centers are already boasting a strong tenant lineup, Trader Joe's, Apple, Lululemon, Aritzia, RH among others. But what gives me the most confidence in this acquisition is the surge in interest from our high-quality retail partners, both existing and new that we've built decade-long relationships with who are expressing interest in Kansas City because Federal is the landlord.\nIt's about rebalancing the mix, phasing out underperforming tenants and bringing in stronger brands while at the same time, capturing rent growth. If we look at our history of results, applying the same strategy, it's not really about what market rents are today. It's about what market rents could be with a strategic marketing strategy that is applied. And with that application, we'll get increased traffic and sales. Strong sales equals rent growth. I really can't say that enough.\nWhile recent acquisitions are exciting, our regional decentralized approach continues to drive value throughout our existing portfolio. whether it's a new giant grocer under construction with small shops at Andora, 217 residential units and 19,000 square feet of new retail space in Bala, Kenwood, new pads, for example, Starbucks and Chase, we are opening a world market in an outdoor former Kmart Garden Center, we continue to turn over new opportunities within our existing portfolio.\nAs I look towards the second half of the year, our manageable watch list, disciplined approach to cost and aggressive approach to getting tenants open and paying rent is yielding positive results. With executed in-place deals already in the third quarter, combined with a healthy pipeline of new leases that are in process, we are setting up 2026 for continued momentum to drive internal growth.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Wendy, and hello, everyone. We reported NAREIT FFO per share for the second quarter of $1.91 includes the recognition of the new market tax credit income a quarter earlier than we had guided. Backing out the $0.15, the resulting $1.76 per share is $0.02 above the top of our effective 2Q guidance range of $1.70 to $1.74. As a result of this outperformance, we raised guidance for 2025 by $0.04 at the midpoint from $7.17 to $7.21 per share, more from $7.02 previously to $7.06 per share when excluding the tax credit income. More details on that a bit later in my remarks.\nComparable POI growth, excluding prior period rents and term fees, was 4.9% for the quarter, which is better than we had forecasted, driven by comparable base rents, which were up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Please note that the free rent period for our 11-year lease extension with Cisco Systems at 500 Santana Row ended during the quarter on May 31. Cash basis comparable growth, excluding prior period rents as a result and term fees was 4% for the quarter and 5.2% after adding back to Cisco free rent.\nA quick update on office leasing for the quarter as we finalized the lease up of the portfolio. 141,000 square feet of total office leases signed for the quarter, with new signed deals at Santana West, bringing the building to almost 90% leased with solid activity on the partial floor that remains available as well as leases that bring 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose to 96% leased.\nThis brings our total amenitized mixed-use portfolio inclusive of Santana West and 915 Meeting Street to 96% leased in total, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years. Amenitized mixed-use and affluent first-ring suburbs of major metros is in high demand, and we continue to see it across our portfolio.\nNow to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. We improved our liquidity at quarter end to $1.55 billion, with over $1.23 billion available on our unsecured credit facility, $177 million of cash and $150 million available to draw down under the recently extended and expanded $750 million term loan. Given strong growth in EBITDA over the quarter and the last 12 months, combined with asset sales completed during the 2Q, we're able to meaningfully enhance our credit metrics.\nIn particular, our second quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at 5.4x, excluding the new income tax credit income, down from 5.7x as reported last quarter and is now within our leverage target metric target for that metric. As mentioned, we successfully completed the sale of 2 assets in 2Q for $143 million at a blended yield in the mid- to upper 5s on a next 12-month basis.\nWe are currently marketing an additional $200-plus million and are considering another $200 million after that to start marketing later in the year. This $400-plus million in total as part of the broader pool we previously identified for potential sale, which is comprised of a mix of both stabilized lower-growth retail and peripherally located residential and office with blended yields targeted in the mid finds.\nFrom a flexibility perspective, the leverage metrics better than our targets, almost $1.6 billion of dry powder, plus the aforementioned asset sales in process we are very well positioned to continue to be on offense with respect to capital deployment, whether it's for additional acquisitions, redevelopments or even buying back our common stock.\nNow on to guidance. As mentioned earlier, with a second consecutive beat and raised second quarter coming in $0.02 above the top of our range and effectively $0.03 above consensus at $1.91 per share, we are raising our forecast for NAREIT-defined FFO per share to $7.16 to $7.26 per share. This represents about 6.5% growth at the increased midpoint of $7.21. Backing out the onetime new market tax credit income from the figures, the range of $7.01 to $7.11 per share, with our revised midpoint climbing $0.04 from $7.02 to $7.06 per share, which represents over 4% versus 2024.\nThis increase is driven by $0.02 of operating outperformance that we can lock in for the year and $0.02 accretion from the Leawood acquisition over the second half of the year or $0.04 on an annualized basis. Given the strong 2Q results, we are increasing our forecast for 2025 comparable POI growth to 3.25% to 4% from the previous range of 3% to 4%. We expect occupancy levels to climb from the current 93.6% level over the second half of the year into the low 94s by year-end. Given deals signed to date and the continued robust pipeline of leasing activity, which is as strong as we have seen in years in terms of volumes, other growth metrics and particularly rollover.\nGiven limited exposure to bankrupt tenants and a better than forecasted first half of the year in terms of our utilization of our credit reserve, we are tightening our range of 75 to 100 basis points to a new range of 75 to 90 basis points. A quick reminder, an outline of our 2025 guidance assumptions is on Page 26 in our 8-K financial supplement.\nWith respect to quarterly FFO cadence for the balance of 2025, our estimates stand at $1.72 to $1.77 for the third quarter and $1.83 to $1.88 for the fourth quarter.\nNow an update on our dividend. As it is done, every year since 1967. Federal Realty's Board of Directors has declared an increase in its quarterly common dividend this year by $0.03 per share per quarter to $1.13 and or $4.52 per share on an annualized basis. This approximately 3% interest -- increase -- sorry, represents the 58th consecutive annual increase of the dividend, a REIT industry record. We stand as the only REIT in the status as a dividend King, which signifies 50 or more years, consecutive years of annual dividend increases.\nAnd with that, operator, open up a line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer, Dan G., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as other members of our executive team that are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Even the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have additional questions, please requeue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. Lots of records were shattered in both the fourth quarter and 2024 that bode well for 2025 and beyond. Let's start with leasing. 100 comparable deals in the quarter for 649,000 square feet at 10% more cash rent, 21% more straight-line rent than the previous lease, nearly 2.4 million square feet of comparable space for calendar 2024 at 11% more cash rent, 22% more straight-line rent than the previous lease.\nBoth the quarter and the full year has had all-time records for us and not by a little bit. Volume in the fourth quarter and total year beat the previous high-water mark set in COVID boosted 2021 by 9% and 14%, respectively. Occupancy touched 96.2% on a lease basis and 94.1% on an occupied basis at year-end, the strongest in nearly a decade. Dividends per share were raised to $4.40 per share for the record-setting 57th consecutive year. Total revenue surpassed $300 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion for the year for the first time ever and grew at 7% and 6% over their respective prior periods. And FFO per share $1.73 in the quarter and $6.77 for the year set all-time records even with the onetime $0.04 charge for Jeff Berkes leaving the company. Without it, FFO per share of $1.77 in the quarter and $6.81 for the year, grew at 7.9% and 4%, respectively. 2024 was a very good year.\nRetail real estate market remained strong, driven by favorable supply-demand dynamics and continued consumer spending. Our diverse portfolio spanning various property types and anchored by strong resilient operators positions us well for sustained success. The struggling retailers making headlines today have minimal impact on our portfolio. Nowhere is the quality of this portfolio more evident than then the continued improvement in occupancy that you see in the fourth quarter over the third quarter and the expectation for even higher occupancy by the end of next year.\nWhile a new administration in Washington is certainly shaking things up on so many fronts across the broader economy, our outlook remains positive. The bottom line is that we expect to grow faster at both the comparable property level and the bottom line earnings level in 2025 than we did in 2024.\nOur product is very much in demand, and that includes the office component of our mixed-use communities in San Jose, Boston and Bethesda. After years of uncertainty on the part employers as to their future office space requirements, the back-to-office movement in the country is real and is fully underway. Recognition on the part of many employers that they need more and better space, coupled with our Class A offering of modern and fully amenitized, I do mean fully amenitized office environments. It's no surprise that we're seeing a significant uptick in interest [ in tours ] and LOIs and in executed leases.\nWe're especially seeing it at Santana West and 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, where nearly 150,000 square feet of deals have been executed or put under heavily negotiated LOIs in the last 90 days. Santana West and 915 Meeting Street are currently 82% and 91% committed under such arrangements at this point, respectively. And we're optimistic that both buildings will be nearly fully leased in this calendar year.\nIt's really good news. And while the 2025 P&L won't be the beneficiary since rent hasn't commenced from the majority of those tenants, that's just timing and should provide a nice bump to '26 and '27.\nOn the development front, things are picking up too. Not only is our $90 million residential over retail project at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center firing along on budget and a bit ahead of schedule. We've approved two other developments, as you can see in our Form 8-K this quarter.\nThe first is the new build of 45 residential units at top 10,000 feet of ground floor retail in Hoboken, New Jersey. [ Ran ] Washington Street, Hoboken's main commercial thoroughfare has a vacant Capital One Bank pad and commensurate service parking. The opportunity to densify is amazing piece of corner real estate works economically to a 6% to 7% unlevered yield on $45 million and a 9% IRR, thanks to more favorable construction pricing, strong retail rents and growing residential rents in densely populated in New York City suburb. We expect to break ground in a few months.\nSecondly, Andorra Shopping Center in Philadelphia is gearing up for a transformational redevelopment that will include a state-of-the-art giant supermarket along with a fully renovated LA Fitness healthcare, new shop space with upgraded service and restaurant tenants and greatly improved placemaking and parking. This $32 million investment will kick off this spring and yield an incremental 7% to 8% unlevered yield. More to come on the development front later in this year, too.\nWe remain very active on the acquisition front with projects being studied and negotiated in both our existing markets, along with a few new ones, and we expect to close on a great shopping center in Northern California in a few weeks. That $123.5 million purchase was a very productive Whole Foods anchor and a cadre of lifestyle-oriented tenants will complement our West Coast portfolio beautifully and will be managed from our Santana Row headquarters. We expect to be able to talk more about that one by the end of the month.\nI also wanted to use the opportunity to introduce 3 newly promoted Vice Presidents to our executive ranks, underscoring our focus on continually developing a deep bench of professionals, all of whom are expected to play a key strategic role in our long-term future. Congratulations to Sara Ford Rogers as VP of Development, working out of our Assembly Row office; to Bob Franz, as VP of Acquisitions, representing our West Coast and Arizona territories, and to Vanessa Mendoza as VP of Leasing, working out of our headquarters in North Bethesda. Congratulations also to Mr. Porter Bellew, who has been promoted to Senior Vice President of our Information Technology Group. Each of these executives have been highly respected members of our team for years, and it brings me great pleasure to be able to recognize that their real estate talents with promotions that expand their influence and responsibility within our organization. I love being able to do that. That's all I wanted to cover in prepared remarks this afternoon, and so I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening it up to your questions.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported [ NAREIT ] FFO per share of $6.77 for the year and $1.73 for the fourth quarter reflects a $0.04 onetime charge for Jeff's departure. Excluding the charge, our FFO growth was 4% and roughly 8% for the full year and fourth quarter, respectively. POI was up 5.4% for the full year and 6.8% for the fourth quarter.\nWe finished 2024 with momentum. Primary drivers for the solid performance in '24. First, POI growth. in our comparable portfolio with the primary catalyst being occupancy increases through continued strength in tenant demand as both leased and occupied metrics increased 200 and 190 basis points, respectively, over year-end 2023 levels as well as solid rollover of 11% on a cash basis and sector-leading contractual rent bumps of roughly 2.5% blended anchor and small shop.\nSecond, contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline with Huntington, Darien Commons, 915 Meeting Street and Lawrence Park approaching stabilization over the year, driving an incremental $12 million of POI, the upper end of our range. And strong performance by the $1.4 billion of gross assets we've acquired since mid-2022, where performance almost across the board has exceeded underwriting, but in particular, at the shops of Pembroke Gardens in Florida, and Kingstowne Town Center in Virginia. This was primarily offset by upward pressure on property level expense margins and higher interest expense relative to 2023.\nComparable POI growth, excluding prior period rent and term fees came in at 4.2% during the fourth quarter and averaged 3.4% for the year. Comparable [ min ] rents grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the year. Our residential portfolio was a source of strength in 2024. Same-store residential POI growth was 5%. And when including Darien Commons, which continues to outperform, it was 7%. The value proposition of providing a premium residential offering on top of an attractive retail amenity base is driving outperformance across our targeted residential portfolio. Additionally, in 2024, we opportunistically acquired almost $300 million in high-quality retail assets during the year, blended initial yields in the low- to mid-7s and unlevered IRRs in the mid to high [indiscernible]. When you include the asset that we put under contract during the fourth quarter, that's over $400 million. Hopefully, more to discuss as the year progresses, we continue to seek new undermanaged and undercapitalized properties to add to the portfolio.\nOn the development, redevelopment and expansion front with the stabilization of a number of redevelopment projects to close out a year, including Darien Commons in Connecticut and Lawrence Park [ and Philly. ] Our in-process pipeline now stands at approximately $785 million, with just $230 million remaining dispense with the addition of a residential over retail project in Hoboken, and the retail redevelopment at Andorra and Philly, we continue to mine opportunities across our portfolio and deploy capital accretively on an external basis to drive future FFO growth. Additional opportunities are under consideration which likely will be added to the pipeline over the course of '25 and into '26.\nNow to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. Our financial flexibility continues to expand as improvement in our leverage metrics accelerated over the course of 2024. Leaning on opportunistic equity issuance on our ATM program to fund accretive acquisitions, targeted asset sales and a growing free cash flow component, which has allowed us to improve our leverage metrics meaningfully.\nFourth quarter annualized adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.5x, down from 6x as reported on this call last year. That time, we forecasted this metric hit our targeted level of 5.5x in 2025, we've been able to get it done in 2024. Fixed charge coverage now stands at 3.8x, up from 3.5x at this time last year. We expect this metric to continue to improve toward our 4x target over the course of the balance -- over the course of '25.\nOur liquidity stood north of $1.4 billion at year-end with an undrawn $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility and $178 million of combined cash and undrawn forward equity. Plus, we have no material debt maturities this year.\nNow on to guidance. For 2025, we are introducing an FFO per share forecast of $7.10 to $7.22 per share. This represents about 5.8% growth at the midpoint of $7.16 and roughly 5% and 7% at the low and high ends of the range. This is driven by comparable POI growth of 3% to 4%, 3.5% at the midpoint. Add an additional 40 basis points to that range when you exclude COVID era prior period rents and term fees. This assumes occupancy levels continue to grow from the current level of 94.1% at 12/31 towards 95% by year-end 2025. And although expect a step back in the first quarter due to the typical seasonality pullback post holidays. We will have net drag of roughly $0.10 to $0.11 from One Santana West as we cease capitalization of interest expense at the property in the second quarter. This is simply a timing delay. The full benefit of $0.12 to $0.14 from the currently 82% committed building is expected to flow directly to the bottom line, but not meaningfully until 2026 as we begin to then recognize rents.\nHaving said that, we do expect $0.14 to $0.15 of benefit from revenues earned through new market tax credits associated with our Freedom Plaza shopping set. The combination of these tax credit revenues at plus $0.14 to $0.15 with net timing drag in '25 from Santana West of minus $0.10 to $0.11, and the wide down of COVID era prior period rents of minus $0.03 to $0.04 fully offset each other, which normalizes our 2025 NAREIT-defined FFO growth and we expect positive FFO growth off this base into 2026.\nOther assumptions to our 2025 guidance include: one, incremental POI contributions from our development and expansion pipeline of $3 million to $5 million and capitalized interest for 2025 estimated at $12 million to $14 million, down from $20 million in 2024. Both of these two assumptions reflect the aforementioned timing impact from Santana West. We forecast $175 million to $225 million of spend this year on redevelopment and expansions at our existing properties. G&A is forecast in the $45 million to $48 million range for the year. Term fees will be $4 million to $5 million, largely in line with 2024, and the aforementioned $3 million of lower prior period collections as we expect a de minimis amount in 2025. We have assumed a total credit reserve of roughly 75 to 100 basis points in '25, given limited exposure to bankrupt tenants, but more in line with historical averages and a normalized cycle of tenant risk in the retailing sector.\nAs is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2025, except the $123.5 million Northern California acquisition under contract, which we expect to close later this month. We will adjust likely upwards for all other acquisitions and dispositions as we go. Please see a summary of this detailed guidance in our 8-K on Page 27 of our [indiscernible]\nWith respect to quarterly FFO cadence for 2025, the first quarter will start with a range of $1.67 to $1.70; second quarter, $1.71 to $1.74; third quarter, $1.90 to $1.93 and the fourth quarter at $1.82 to $1.85. Cadence for comparable growth will start slow in the first quarter in the mid-2s and improve sequentially over the course of the year. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Brenda Pomar, Senior Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood evening. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are: Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Berkes, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dan G., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President; as well as other members of our executive team that are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

[Operator Instructions]\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Brenda, and good afternoon, everyone. So here are the highlights. All-time record quarterly FFO per share at $1.69, exceeding internal expectations, analyst consensus had a very tough comp 1 year ago.\nAll-time record second quarter comparable leasing volume at 594,000 square feet with a 4,000 square feet as the most comparable leasing volume ever in any quarter. Strong occupancy gains on both a lease and an occupied basis, to 95.3% and 93.1%, respectively, up 100 and 110 basis points, respectively, from the last quarter. Levels not seen since the 2017-2019 time period.\nQuarterly residential operating income on our stabilized resi properties, up 6.7% versus last year. 9.5% when including the New Darien, Connecticut product. By the way, the apartments of Darien and Commons are 99% leased with a waiting list to get in.\nStrong transactional activity in the quarter with the $215 million acquisition of Virginia Gateway, and the $12 million buyout of the minority interest in CocoWalk. Not to mention the sale of our remaining assets on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica for $103 million. The momentum continued in July with our $60 million acquisition of Panola Vista Crossing in Panola, California.\nYes, this was a very strong quarter, top to bottom. And based on what we see with our deal pipeline, the leasing environment is expected to continue to at least the balance of the year. Let me give you a little more color on leasing and its impact on occupancy.\n122 comparable deals at an average starting rent of $37.72 per foot compared with the final year of the previous lease of $34.49 more rent to start NetScreen. But by the way, those numbers include 98% of our deals, so they are truly representative of the entire company's results.\nBut what makes that particularly impressive is that the rent on many of the previous leases has likely been growing at 3% or so over the last 5 or 10 years. And there's still room to increase the new rent to start the next 5- to 10-year cycle.\nIt's actually 23% more on a straight-line basis because of those very important contractual months. Contractual rent bumps on all of our commercial deals done this quarter averaged 2.4% and sit at roughly 2.25% portfolio-wide are likely the best portfolio-wide in the business.\nThis is new for us. It's why in the last 20 years, this company has grown its bottom line earnings, 18 of them with only the great financial crisis and the global pandemic momentary setbacks. In this second quarter, 2Q year-over-year growth is muted largely due to the Bidvest stores that were all still open in the second quarter of last year. Yet we still expect the full year growth over 2023 to be right at the top of the second.\nCompare FFO per share growth over the past 1, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year period against any other large retail portfolio that has a long history, and you'll see why we're so committed to our way of doing this.\nThe impact on occupancy on both the leased and fiscal basis has been steady and impressive over the last 3 years, but never more so than this quarter. Both small shop and anchor occupancy growth stood out.\nIn the 2024 second quarter, we picked up 100 basis points in overall lease percentage, bringing in to 95.3%. Great results, thanks to recording setting -- record-setting leasing volumes, the acquisition of a well-leased Virginia Gateway the sale of a less well leased Third Street Promenade, and by the planned redevelopment of places like Enduro Shopping Center. Our anchor lease percentage gained 90 basis points alone since last quarter and sits at 96.7% and there's another 100-plus basis points to comment here.\nLet me talk for a moment or 2 about the transactions this quarter, starting with the sale of Third Street Proman Santa mix. First of all, what a great investment this has been for the trust over the past 25 years, a 13% unlevered IRR over that period and a springboard for this company into relationships with a type of tenant that benefited every mixed-use and lifestyle-oriented project we did.\nOver the past few years, we lost confidence in the future income growth there for a host of reasons and sold to a local developer for $103 million. $120 million when including a one-off sale there late last year. Reinvesting those proceeds in the dynamic asset like Virginia Gateway with 4 more future growth possibilities seem like a no-brainer.\nWe've spoken about Virginia Gateway at various events and meetings over the past couple of months, so don't use this time to repeat them. Suffice it to say, our Virginia management development team is all over it and excited to have the new role of material to create significant value over the next few years through re-leasing and selected placemaking and redevelopment.\nAnd earlier this week, we closed on the acquisition of Canola Bisto Shopping Center in Northern California for $60 million, which will generate initial cash-on-cash return in the low 7s, and we'll grow from there. This dominant 216,000 square foot grocery-anchored regional shopping center sits on 19 acres and was purchased at $277 a foot. Not bad.\nThe center fits in nicely with our West Coast portfolio complementing Crow Canyon Commons and East Bay Bridge and the East Bay and will be managed from our West Coast headquarters at Santana Row. We're not done on the acquisition from either.\nLease-up at Santana West continues with a newly signed deal with an AI-powered cloud database provider for 24,000 square feet on the first floor of the state-of-the-art building, active negotiations with other prospective tenants for much of the remainder of the building, should enable us to continue to report on new deals.\nAnd the Lower Merion Township outside Philadelphia, long-standing old Lord & Taylor building at our Belkinwood Shopping Center has been fully demolished, and construction is underway on our $95 million residential development of 217 apartments with ground floor retail.\nThat will be integrated with and complementary to one of Federal's most successful shopping centers. We expect a 7% stabilized yield here. It's nice to see that development economics could still work in the right locations.\nIt might be interested to know that in addition to Bellekeno, we have over 3,700 residential units with active design or entitlements in process at a dozen of our existing assets. as construction costs continue to stabilize as they've been doing and rents continue to rise with inflation as they've been doing, these projects are getting closer and closer to pencil. Stay tuned.\nBy the way, for those New Yorkers listening, who may have reason to be on Long Island around Huntington, please stop by our completely redeveloped and reimagined Huntington shopping center where the brand-new Whole Foods opened just last week and joined new cadre of tenants, including REI, Ulta, new dining alternatives and others set a beautifully landscaped comfortable setting really represents the best of Federal Realty thinking and execution.\nThe $85 million comprehensive redevelopment brought in on time and on budget. The before and after effect is pretty striking. Huntington Shopping Center is now a worthy grocery-anchored open-air complement to Simon's powerful Walt Woodman Mall next door.\nAs I was finishing up these prepared remarks earlier in the week, I was reading them to the senior team in preparation for this call. Our President, Jeff Berkes sat back reflectively and commented as to how significant the results of our capital allocation decisions have been over the past 90 to 120 days, given the relative size of this company. He's right.\nCollectively, they're meaningful, and they move the needle in 102 property portfolio. I mean between Virginia Gateway and Plano, we've made nearly 900,000 square feet of acquisitions, deploying $275 million of capital at a 7-plus percent yield.\nWe've completed a comprehensive and transformational $85 million redevelopment of Pizza New York, began a new $95 million misuse development in balance and freed up $103 million of underperforming capital with the Third Street Promenade sale. All while executing 124 total leases for over 600,000 square feet of commercial space cementing future growth. I'd say the future looks bright.\nThat's all I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks this afternoon. So I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening it up to your questions.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.69 for the second quarter came in at the top of our quarterly guidance range of $1.63 to $1.69. This result was against a tough second quarter 2023 comp, which was our previous record for quarterly FFO, highlighting the overall strength and operating fundamentals across the portfolio.\nPrimary drivers for the strong performance simply POI growth and our comparable portfolio, driven by strong property level expense controls, acceleration in our occupancy levels and continued strength in our residential portfolio. Comparable POI growth, excluding the impact of prior period rent term fees was 2.9%, and that's GAAP. It's 3.1% on a cash basis. Both numbers are above our expectations for the period, and you will see a revision upward guidance as a result.\nComparable total property revenues were up 3.1%, with comparable min rents of 2.7% on a GAAP basis and 2.9% on a cash basis. Solid results when you keep in mind that Bed Bath & Beyond was in perception and largely paying rent throughout the second quarter.\nPortfolio occupancy increased in the quarter to 95.3% leased and 93.1% occupied. Both metrics over 100 basis points increase since March 31. As a result, rents from signed leases not yet occupied in the existing portfolio stayed elevated at $26 million with an additional $13 million of rent come online from leases signed in the noncomparable pipeline.\nAlso note that we continue to have a robust leasing pipeline with a significant amount of booties as be negotiated for currently vacant space. With the tenant watch list that is minimal, given our lack of exposure to troubled tenants and our proven ability to get tenants open and rent paying for a tenant coordination team that is second to none, we expect our current spread between leased and occupied to move toward our target of 125 basis points over the quarters ahead.\nAs we stood last quarter, we are extremely well positioned again, to drive our occupancy metrics over the balance of the year and have increased our targeted year-end occupancy level to roughly 93.5%. The strength in leasing from a rollover and contractual ramp-up perspective with 10% cash rollover and 2.4% blended increases from the combined anchor and small shop leases resulted in a straight-line lease rollover of 23% and net effective lease straight-line rollover after capital of 15%, which highlights our ongoing focus on controlling tenant capital.\nNow to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. Given roughly $700 million of successful refinancing activity to start 2024, we have no material maturities until 2026. We stand with about $1.3 billion of available liquidity from our $1.25 billion credit facility and net cash on hand.\nThis liquidity stands against redevelopment expansion spend remaining of only $65 million for the balance of 2024 and only $205 million remaining to spend on our needle-moving $850 million in-process redevelopment and expansion pipeline. With the completion of the sale of Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica for $103 million, access to the equity markets and the acquisition of Virginia Gateway and buyout of our partners at CocoWalk, along with meaningful growth in EBITDA this quarter, our leverage metrics at June 30 continue to show improvement.\nQ2 annualized net debt to EBITDA has decreased to 5.8x. That metric targeted to improve over the course of 2024 and reach the mid-5s in 2025. Fixed charge coverage increased to 3.6x for the quarter. That metric should also improve as incremental EBITDA continues to come online.\nAnd with respect to guidance, with a solid first 2 quarters behind us and tenant demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are raising our 2024 FFO guidance from $6.77 per share at the midpoint to $6.79, with a range refined upwards to $6.70 to $6.88. This represents 3.7% bottom line FFO growth at the midpoint and 5% at the upper end of the range.\nStrong growth in the face of a higher interest rate environment that faced us in both 2022 and again here in 2023, and again here in 2024. This upward revision implies over 5% FFO growth at the midpoint in the second half of 2024.\nThis upward revision is driven by stronger underlying portfolio performance than expected as occupancy metrics outperform expectation, as well the acquisition of Virginia Gateway and Old Vista Crossing, combined with the sale in Santa Monica, which provide -- which only provides modest net accretion this year, but will contribute more fully in 2025.\nOur guidance reflects only these 3 transactions. As a reminder, prospective acquisitions and dispositions will be reflected in our guidance when completed. We are also revising our comparable growth outlook -- upward comparable growth, excluding prior period rent and term fees is revised to 3% to 4%, 3.5% at the midpoint.\nWe are leaving our comparable growth outlook as is at 2.25% to 3.5%, given term fees, year-to-date have lagged. As such, we are adjusting downward our assumption for term fees from $4 million to $7 million to $4 million to $6 million as well as our assumption for G&A expense down to $48 million to $51 million.\nWhile leasing progress continues both at 1 Santana West and 915 Meeting Street, none of this incremental activity is expected to impact our forecast for 2024. We will see the benefit in 2025. More to come on that outlook overall as the year progresses, additional leases get signed and clarity on delivery dates becomes more evident.\nWe are maintaining our expected credit reserve of 70 to 90 basis points and all other guidance assumptions can be found outlined on Page 27 of our 8-K.\nNow before we go to Q&A, let me highlight that yet again, Federal Realty's Board of Directors has declared an increase in its quarterly common dividend per share to $1.10 or $4.40 per share on an annualized basis, which represents the 57th consecutive year we've increased the dividend.\nThe REIT industry record, we stand as the only REIT with the status as a dividend king, which signifies 50 or more consecutive years of annual dividend increases. 57-year record serves as a testament to our commitment to delivering a stable, growing cash flow stream for our common shareholders.\nAnd with that, operator, we going to open up the line for questions."

Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Berkes, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dan G., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer; and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President. As well as other members of our executive team that are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but our Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe [indiscernible] and earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued tonight our annual report filed on Form 10-K and other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of what that may affect our financial condition and results operations. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions, please [ reach out ]. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don to give the discussion of our first quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, it's a new year and Federal continues to charge forward. With a very solid $1.64 recorded in the quarter, along with 3.8% same-center growth when excluding term fees and too repayments and an all-time first quarter record 567,000 square feet of retail leads to 9% higher rents. The answer to the often asked question of do Demographics matter post pandemic become quite evident, that sure do.\nThe level of leasing activity in the quarter is particularly notable. Our record retail leasing was impressive, but maybe more so was the 190,000 square feet of office space leased at our mixed-use properties. Supplementing the long-awaited 141,000 square foot lease to accounting consulting firm PwC [indiscernible], bringing that building to nearly half leased was an additional nearly 50,000 feet leased elsewhere in the mixed-use portfolio, including two deals at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, bringing that building to nearly 80% leased.\nThe remaining vacancy at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and 1 Santana West represents considerably less than 2% of the value of the company. Tenant interest in the remaining space at both buildings remain solid. All in all, for the quarter, we signed 117 commercial leases, retail plus mixed-use office for over 775,000 square feet of space with strong economics, not including our residential portfolio, which itself generated record first quarter property operating income of over $17 million.\nMake no mistake, our product, primarily retail, but also including complementary office and residential is very desirable in the marketplace and a huge positive differentiator. Obviously, higher interest rates take away some of that operating positivity when you get down to the FFO line, but we still grew at over 3% in the quarter and at $1.64 at the higher end of our guidance range. For comparable retail deals in the quarter that cumulatively were written at 9% higher cash basis rent than the final year of the previous tenant or 20% on a straight-line basis.\nAnd just to pound the point home one more time, those cash-based rollover increases come on top of leases that have had what we believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector making that roll over all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the first quarter were roughly 2.3% blended anchor and small shop. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio, not just 1 or 2 or 3 quarters worth, approximates 2.25% and higher when considering the offices, best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent bumps.\nNow I spoke last quarter about the upside in our occupancy, especially with respect to shop space and felt that another 100 basis points over the 90.7% that we reported at year-end was doable. In the first quarter of 2024, we picked up 70 of those 100 basis points bringing our small shop lease percentage to 91.4%. There's more to come here. Our anchored lease percentage is 95 basis points to come there. Those two components combined at 94.3% leased overall. Pretty strong, but as we're demonstrating, room to grow.\nWe take a very proactive approach to leasing and often lease space well in advance of an existing lease expiration or vacancy. All in the name of improved tenant health and merchandising mix and as an insurance policy towards potential gaps and future cash flow. We've got some impactful anchor renewals coming up later this year and early next that should continue the positive trajectory.\nIn terms of a tenant watchlist or other indications of a shift in demand, there is nothing out of the ordinary that we can point to. We have little exposure to those tenants that are most talked about these days, Express, Big locks, Johannes, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only as they tend to cater to a lower income demographic, our tenants have been largely been able to pass on cost of goods and labor increases to their customers. Those customers may grumble at the higher prices, but thus far, they've been both able and more importantly, willing to pay them.\nIn addition, our retail tenant base is very well diversified, both in terms of tenant concentration as well as property type. And while we'll always have one-off tenant failures that's just part of the business, portfolio-wide collectability issues haven't been and are not expected to be outside our historical experience or specific 2024 guidance. business looks good.\nThe last topic I want to address before turning it over to Dan relates to external growth. While we've turned down the dial a bit on immediate development projects, the residential development of [ Balkin ] with Shopping Centre notwithstanding, we turned up the dial and level of intensity on sourcing acquisitions. It's an interesting and unique time in the acquisition marketplace right now. While there is a limited supply of Federal Realty type opportunities out there, there's also less viable competition for those centers than there has been historically.\nWe look for shopping centers that are generally larger in size than the average center. With opportunities for remerchandising, redevelopment, higher rents and yup, potential site intensification. We look for shopping centers in markets that have strengthened significantly over the past 15 years and especially post pandemic. Markets like Phoenix, Central and South Florida and Northern Virginia, among others. We look for shopping centers that are immediately accretive to earnings based on the -- based on our cost of capital advantage but even more importantly, produce returns meaningfully above our long-term cost of capital.\nWe look for shopping centers that will be immediately financed through the combination of other asset sales and our largely undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and then refinanced for the long term subsequent. We've begun our due diligence process on one such large asset currently and have a growing pipeline of others. Obviously, it remains to be seen if and how much success we'll have in this buy versus build cycle, but using both our operating strength and reputation as well as our balance sheet strength and flexibility is a specific focus of ours for the balance of this year and next.\nThat's all I wanted to cover in prepared remarks this afternoon. So I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening up to your questions.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the first quarter was up 3.1% versus a year ago and came in at the upper end of our quarterly guidance range of $1.60 to $1.65 and which we provided on our earnings call back in February. Property operating income was up 5.6%, also above our expectations, highlighting the overall strength of our real estate. Primary drivers for the strong start to 2024, POI growth in our comparable portfolio, up almost 4% excluding prior period rents and [indiscernible] driven by resiliency in our occupancy levels, continued strength in our residential portfolio.\nThis was primarily offset by lighter term forecast and some timing noise with respect to collection. We have an expectation of reversing that over the balance of the year. Operable POI growth, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees was 3.8%. Comparable minimum rents grew 3.6%, and comparable total property revenues were up 4.1%. Portfolio occupancy levels show greater resiliency than we forecast as our leased rate increased up to 94.3% and our occupancy rate is expected as retail leasing volumes hit record levels with our leasing and tenant coordination teams, getting tenants open sooner and keeping tenants in place longer, testament to our ability to grind out revenue growth rating best-in-class tenant liners.\nGiven the tremendous start to the year from a leasing perspective, coupled with a strong pipeline of lease deals in process, which are some of the highest levels we've seen post COVID, we are extremely well [indiscernible] on our occupancy metrics over the coming quarters. It's too soon to increase our targeted year-end occupancy levels, but we are in a good spot at this point in the year. Another part of our business worthy of note is our residential portfolio. It continues to be a source of strength. Same-store residential POI growth was 6% in the first quarter.\nOn the heels of a similarly revenue growth against 3% expense growth, leading to results well ahead of forecast. While we are dialing down new development starts are still substantial in process development pipeline continues to make meaningful contributions as lease-up continues at these projects. Darian Residential continues to exceed expectations and is [indiscernible].\nDarian Retail is over 90% leased with several store openings set over the coming quarters. Huntington Shopping Center is 94% leased with Whole Foods and other set open by third quarter. As Don mentioned, 915 Pike & Rose Street and 1 Santana West continued solid progress at almost 80% and 50% leased, respectively. Note that global Foodservice giant Sodexo moved into its new North American headquarters of Spike and Rose during the quarter. Now on to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position.\nAll of our refinancing requirements 2024 were handled at the very start of the quarter with our $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes offering. This leaves us with no material maturities until 2026. We stand with over $1.33 billion of available liquidity from our $1.25 billion credit facility and cash on hand and have redevelopment and expansions spend remaining of only $100 million for the balance of 2021. Additional funding sources this year approach almost $0.5 billion and include expanding leverage-neutral debt capacity as EBITDA comes online in the $150 million to $175 million range of $50 million to $75 million as we approach recovered levels and a sizable asset sale pipeline under consideration.\nOur leverage metrics continue to be solid as first quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA stands just inside 6x. That metric is targeted to improve over the '24 to 5.7x by year-end and to 5.5x in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.5x at quarter end, and that metric should also improve as incremental EBITDA comes online over the balance of 2024. Now with respect to guidance, with a first -- solid first quarter behind us, leasing demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are tightening and raising our 2024 FFO guidance from $6.76 per share at the midpoint to $6.77, with a range refined upwards to $667 to $6.87.\nThis represents 3.4% bottom line FFO growth at the midpoint and almost 5% at the upper end of the range. Keep in mind, this is being done with the realization that interest rates will likely remain higher for longer and provide roughly $0.02 to $0.03 of greater headwinds in 2024 than we originally forecast go. This upward revision and guidance is driven by stronger underlying portfolio performance than expected as leasing and occupancy metrics outperform expectations as well as a more optic outlook for such difficult to forecast it marking, specialty leasing and percentage rate.\n[indiscernible] to that, some of our first quarter headwinds are expected to be timing issues that should help in the coming quarters. As a result, we are also revising our comparable growth outlook upward. Comparable growth is now forecast at 2.25% to 3.5%, up to 2% to 3.5% and our comparable growth, excluding prior period, rents and term fees is now forecast at 2.75% to 4%, up from 2.5% to 4%. While we made significant progress at 1 Santana West, the 915 [ Meeting ] Street, in the first quarter, none of those leases are expected to impact our forecast in 2024.\nYou will see the impact in 2025. More to come on that outlook as the year progresses and additional leases get signed. All other guidance assumptions as outlined on Page 27, our 8-K remain unchanged, although please note, we do not include prospective acquisitions and dispositions activity in our guidance. We will update our forecast for that activity as it completed.\nNow before we go to Q&A, I'd like you to please listen up for [indiscernible] with the first quarter in the books at $1.64 per share, our quarterly FFO outlook for the second quarter is $1.63 and $1.69. Again, $1.63 to $1.69 for the second quarter. Consistent with the cadence presented on our call in February, the third and fourth quarter should increase sequentially and from there reflecting the continued momentum we are seeing in color business. With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

If you have additional questions, please requeue.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Lea, and good afternoon, everybody. Well, 2023 is in the books with a strong dollar -- before recorded in the fourth quarter, finish off with what is an all-time record earnings year at $6.55 of FFO per share. That's happening despite over $600 million of construction progress not yet contributing. And higher interest expense that cost to trust an additional $0.27 per share when compared with the average rate in 2022.\nWith comparable money cost between '22 and '23, FFO growth per share would have been 8%, right up there with our best pre-COVID years. It says a lot in terms of the power of the portfolio that has grown bottom line FFO per share at a compound annual growth of 4.5% over the last 20 years in addition to an average uninterrupted dividend yield of roughly 3% or better. That includes the great financial crisis, it includes a global pandemic, it includes everything, a better portfolio to own for long-term investors in our opinion.\nIt also feels like we're getting closer to a time where accelerated acquisition activity, coupled with our redevelopment and remerchandising expertise on new acquisitions could boost that growth rate over the next few years. As far as today's environment, demand continues to exceed supply for highest quality assets in the close-in suburbs, and with the impacts of the pandemic in the rearview mirror and lack of new supply coming on, I don't see this positive supply-demand dynamic change anytime soon.\nOur average in-place rents portfolio-wide are $31.60 per foot and the comparable retail deals we did in the fourth quarter were at $44.57 a foot and were $36.75 for the entire year. I've been hearing that Oriana can't be pushed further for the better part of the last 20 years. And I guess, on a relative basis, they are. Better properties have higher rents. Better properties have higher tenant sales and profitability, too. Frankly, it's obvious.\nPercentage rents are an interesting barometer on this topic. While we push for a strong fixed rent in nearly every lease, tenant sales above a threshold level points to additional rent. Percentage rent and overage rent totaled $1 million in the fourth quarter and $19.3 million for the year, an all-time record, which broke the $18.8 million record from the year earlier.\nFourth quarter retail leasing continued to rank with another 100 comparable retail deals done at 12% rollover on a cash basis, 23% on a straight-line basis. These comparable retail deals account for virtually all 98% of the total retail deals done in the quarter, making them representative of the entire portfolio, not just a fraction. It was a great leasing year, the third in a row where we exceeded 2 million square feet, roughly 25% more than the 5-year average in 2015 and 2019.\nIt's just a pound a point home. Those cash basis rollover increases come on top of leases that have had what I believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector, making their rollover all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the fourth quarter were roughly 2.5% blended across small shop with new and renewal small shops at approximately 3%. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio [ across ] small shop not just 1 quarter tour, but the whole thing approximates [ 2.25% ] best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well in future, especially the contractual windfalls.\nWe ended the year with overall portfolio leased at 94.2%, pretty strong, but with room to grow. That breaks down between anchors at 96% leased and shop space at 9.7%. When you look at occupancy possibilities going forward by looking at our past, it's reasonable to expect another 100 basis points of small shelf occupancy and another 200 basis points of anchor occupancy improvement in the coming 12 to 18 months depending, of course, on the extent of future bankruptcies that we are not seeing today. They're not at all obvious.\nThe residential and office product and our mixed-use properties continues to outperform competing supply in non-mixed use environments and stood at 96% leased for both our comparable resi and comparable mixed-use office product at year-end while commanding premium rents. Progress leasing up our mixed-use office under development, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and Santana West has been measurably stronger with 215,000 square feet newly leased or in the final stages of the LOI to sign the lease process. That includes the first signed deal at Santana West with Acrisure, the global fintech leader to the insurance sector. With those deals complete, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose will be 80% leased and Santana West will be nearly half leased up.\nI go through all this to really try to hammer home the obvious health of a business, centered around leasing high-quality retail-centric properties in the close-end suburbs of America's greatest cities. While bottom line results are and will continue to be muted by the higher but certainly reasonable cost of capital, that is stabilizing, rents will likely continue to adjust upward over time to that reality. This is especially true for tenants and locations in affluent areas where customers can absorb higher costs. I hope that higher interest rates don't cloud investors' appreciation, the strong underlying business fundamentals that exist today and likely tomorrow.\nWith that drop, we're also really excited to add a substantial expansion to the 87-unit first phase of residential product that we built at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia a few years back. The first base open strong and remains fully leased with growing rents, strong supply and demand dynamics in this close-in part of Philadelphia's mainline along with construction costs moderating means that we're able to build an additional 217 residential units, 6,000 feet of additional retail and the covered partner spaces service at all on the former Lord + Taylor site at Bala Cynwyd. The shopping center features an expansive tenant roster, including an LA Fitness Gym, a full-service grocery, restaurants and necessary services, which are often cited as the [ recent presidents ] are choosing it. Projects should get underway later this year, begin with the demo of the old Lord + Taylor building, it should yield a 7% cash on cost return when stabilized, drive a double-digit unlevered IRR and based on the rent growth we've seen and expect and be funded from free cash flow.\nOkay. On to 2024, where we certainly expect another record this year with an energized team and a strong set of optimism. Dan will go into a bunch more detail, and I'll turn it over to him and then open it up to your questions. Dan?\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don. Hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the fourth quarter and $6.55 for the year were up 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, versus 2022. POI was up 6.5% in fourth quarter and a more impressive 7.2% for the year.\nPrimary driver to the strong performance in 2023, first, POI growth our comparable portfolio, up almost 5% on a cash basis, excluding prior period rents and terms and fees, driven by both higher rents and higher average occupancy over the course of the year. Driven by continued strength in consumer traffic and tenant sales, particularly at our mixed-use assets, driving parking revenues and average percentage rent higher. Effectively controlling property level expenses and having a lower credit reserve than we originally forecast.\nSecond, contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline, which came in at the upper end of our forecast. And lastly, continued focus on overall expense controls, the G&A came in below expectations. This was offset primarily by higher interest rate headwinds totaling $0.27. To reiterate Don's point earlier, with a consistent cost of debt versus 2022, FFO per share growth year-over-year would have been 8% in 2023. Reflecting an exceptionally strong year of growth at the property levels.\nGAAP-based comparable POI growth came in at 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.2% for the year and a comparable cash basis, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees, growth was 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. As a reminder, this information, including the components of prior period rent term fees and GAAP to cash adjustments can be found on Page 12, our quarterly 8-K supplement.\nOur residential portfolio continues to be a source of strength despite headwinds in the broader residential to. Same-store residential POI growth was 5.8% in 4Q along with revenue growth for the quarter at 6%, and we expect this strength to continue into 2024. The value proposition of providing a premium residential offering on top of an attractive retail amenity base is driving outperformance across our targeted residential portfolio.\nAlso a big driver of our growth in 2023 and with continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline as $18 million of incremental POI came online from our $750 million in-process pipeline. And we expect that to be the case moving forward as well as we add new projects to the lineup and maintain that part of our business is a continued driver of growth. The scale and skill set of our redevelopment program is a key differentiator for Federal.\nNotable updates to our in-process pipeline, which will contribute an additional $9 million to $12 million of POI in 2024 include $115 million debt income projects in Connecticut, where the residential is fully stabilized 98.4%; occupancy with rents above $4 per foot per month, well above underwriting. And our retention rates remain above 90%, and the retail component approaches 90% leased. A testament to what a strong retail amenity base can bring to a residential project.\nAt the $190 million, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, which hotels fully moved in as they open in 4Q, plus they've taken additional space. Sodexo's U.S. headquarters is next on deck to open with multiple [ opens ] actively negotiating leases. At Huntington Shopping Center among Central Long Island, this $85 million Whole Foods anchored redevelopment is over 90% leased with new anchor REI opening during the fourth quarter in addition to a number of small shops. We feel very good about the yield on this project approaching the top end of our 7% to 8% return range. For those of you in the New York area, it's worth a trip out to Central Long Island later this year after [ it ] opens to check it out as well as the Melville asset, a mile further south. Both are exceptional retail redevelopments, which truly highlight Federal's skill set. Additionally, in 2023, we incrementally ended over $120 million in properties we only partially owned previously at an effective 8.1% cap rate. No better risk-adjusted investment in deploying capital, accretively into assets we know extremely well. On levered IRRs on these investments in the double digits.\nNow to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. You all saw, we refinanced our $600 million bond maturity, which came due on January 15, for a combination of a $200 million secured loan on our Bethesda Row property and an effective 5% fixed rate for the first 2 years of the loan, plus [ 2 1-year ] extensions at our effectively a 4-year long and a $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes [ offered ] due 2029, raised in early January and an effective 3.9% interest rate all-in. Part of that transaction, we purchased a [ call spread ] to increase the effective strike price on the convert of 40%, up above $143 per share. So no incremental economic dilution unless the common stock fee above that level as adjustment.\nPro forma for the most recent financing and dividend based, our liquidity stands of $1.3 billion with an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and available cash on hand. Plus we have no maturities remaining in 2024 and no material maturities until 2026. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong as fourth quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.9x and that metric should improve over the course of 2024 and hit our target of 5.5x in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.6x at year-end that metric should continue to improve as incremental EBITDA on online and interest rates fall over the second half of 2024.\nNow on to guidance. For 2024, we are introducing an FFO per share forecast $6.65 to $6.87 per share. This represents over 3% growth at the midpoint of $6.76 and roughly 5% at the high end of the range. This is driven by comparable growth of 2.5% to 4% when excluding prior period rents and term fees, [ 5% ] the midpoint. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.2% at 12/31, up to roughly 93% by year-end 2024. Although expect a step back in the first quarter due to expected seasonality [ since August ], I'm going to add in additional contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline of $9 million to $12 million. For those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K on Page 16, where we provide our forecast of stabilized POI and timing by project.\nNow this will be offset by modestly lower prior period collections expected to be roughly $3 million in 2024 versus $5 million in '23, modestly lower net term fees forecasted in the $4 million to $7 million range in '24 versus $7 million in '23 and continued drag from higher money costs. The recent $600 million of notes that we repaid last month at an effective rate of 3.7% versus the new blended cost on our 2 most recent refinancing of 4.3%. Other assumptions include $100 million to $150 million of spend this year on redevelopment and expansions on our existing properties. G&A is forecast in the $48 million to $52 million range for the year and capitalized interest for 2024 is estimated at $18 million to $21 million. We've assumed a total credit reserve consisting of bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy incentive rent relief of 70 to 90 basis points for 2024, more in line with pre-pandemic historical averages.\nAnd as is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2024. We will adjust likely upwards as we go, given our opportunistic approach to build. Quarterly FFO cadence for 2024 is forecast to have the first quarter being roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2023 at a range of $1.60 to $1.65 and with sequential growth each quarter thereafter. We see the detailed summary of this guidance in our 8-K on Page 28 and in our presses.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Berkes, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dan G., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President; as well as other members of our executive team that are here to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance.\nAlthough Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements. And we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued tonight, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial conditions and the results of operations. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a good time to own high-quality retail-centric real estate. Demand exceeds supply for the best stuff, and this past quarter's results and in fact, the whole year thus far has made that patently obvious.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we signed comparable leases, in other words, 95% of all the deals done during the quarter. The only deals we exclude in our definition of comparable relate to ground-up construction for over 0.5 million square feet, 553,000 to be exact. For the 9 months of 2023, that's over 1.6 million square feet of comparable deals, a mark we've never hit before. It's more than the first 9 months of '22, which itself was a record and more than the first months -- 9 months of 2021, which itself set a record.\nYou can see it in the occupancy numbers, too. While the Bed Bath closings were expected to [indiscernible] reduced occupancy in the quarter versus last year by 100 basis points, our overall occupancy declined just 30 basis points on a lease basis and 50 basis points on an occupied basis. That says something about demand.\nIf you dig deeper, small shop occupancy, the part of the business we have the most consternation about, increased another 50 basis points to 90.7% on a lease basis and 80 basis points on an occupied basis. This trend has been a steady and powerful trend for 2.5 years now.\nWhen you look at occupancy possibilities going forward by looking at our past, it's reasonable to expect another 100 basis points of small shop occupancy and another 250 basis points of anchor occupancy due largely to Bed Bath, roughly 200 basis points overall in the coming 18 months or 2 years depending, of course, on the extent of future bankruptcies that are not obvious to us today.\nI go through all this to really try to hammer home the obvious health of a business centered around leasing high-quality retail-centric properties in the first-ring suburbs of America's greatest cities. While bottom line results are and will continue to be muted by the higher but certainly historically reasonable cost of capital that's likely here to stay, rents will likely adjust upward over time to that reality especially with tenants and in locations that are affluent.\nI hope that higher interest rates don't cloud investors' appreciation of the strong underlying business fundamentals that exist today and likely tomorrow. So let's talk about rents. 100 comparable deals, which again represents 95% of the deals done this quarter, was certainly representative of the total company. 553,000 square feet, starting new rent of $34.51, final year old rent, $31.17. That's plus 11% on a cash basis, 21% on a straight-line basis, a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years, excluding options.\nThe average lease term with all options exercised is more like 16 years. An average CAGR of contractual rent bumps of this quarter's leases was 2.5%. TIs per foot of $31.19 when you don't consider this quarter's option exercises, $16.67 per foot when you do.\nBeen hearing that our rents are high for the better part of the last 20 years. I guess on a relative basis, they are. Better properties have higher rents. Better properties have higher tenant sales and profitability, too. Frankly, it's obvious.\nThat sustained leasing volume and those economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent bumps. Third quarter results benefited from that level of activity over the past 6 quarters.\nFFO per share of $1.65 in the third quarter was ahead of consensus, was ahead of internal expectations and ahead of last year's third quarter by 4% despite far higher interest expense and lost Bed Bath income. This is a really strong quarter for us.\nAs you know, we are particularly active on the acquisition front during the COVID years of 2021 through 2022. In total, $1 billion in new additions to the core portfolio during that time, whereby the post-acquisition leasing continues to exceed the acquisition underwriting.\nSimilarly, leasing production in properties that have recently undergone redevelopment and/or property improvement plans have also continued to outperform our expectations, and we also expect that to continue. And while big new acquisitions have slowed given the higher cost of capital, note that in 2023, we've been able to invest over $120 million at 8% with a blended IRR above 10.\nWe did that through number one, the acquisition of our partner's 22% interest in Escondido Shopping Center; secondly, the acquisition of the fee and the portion of the Huntington Square Shopping Center that we didn't previously own; and number three in October, the fee under Mercer on One in Princeton, New Jersey, one of our best-performing regional shopping centers over the last 20 years, smart accretive capital deployment of real estate very well known to us in each case.\nAnd as strong as the core shopping center business has been, the large mixed-use properties have been even stronger. Retail leased occupancy at 97%, residential lease occupancy at 98%, office lease occupancy at 97% excluding buildings under development. Powerful traffic counts and tenant sales make these property the center of the communities in which they operate. They draw customers from distances far more than a local neighborhood.\nAnd so as not to leave it out and as I mentioned on prior calls, our multi-tenant leasing strategy at Santana West has generated meaningful tenant interest that has progressed to advanced lease negotiations with multiple tenants for more than half the building. While leases are not executed yet, our progress here is noteworthy.\nStrength of our business is grounded in superior demographics, always has been, always will be. More density, higher incomes of real barriers to entry are always important in our business but never more so than an uncertain time in the economy.\nPast cycles have proven this out time and time again. With 70,000 households with annual household incomes of over $150,000 sitting within 3 miles of Federal centers, there's simply no large open-air portfolio available for the public investor to own and that's -- not one.\nNaturally, we're all on the lookout for changes in the strength of the American consumer and their spending habits because, as you know, it's remained surprisingly resilient. So we tried to dissect the limited tenant sales data that we have for the 2023 third quarter and compared it to the 2022 third quarter.\nAs expected for us, sales were up portfolio-wide. Digging a little deeper, our properties with the highest average income surrounding them saw a quarter-over-quarter tenant sales that were significantly better than our properties with the lowest average income surrounding them. So no surprise, but an indicator we're keeping our eyes on in the months and the year ahead. As I said upfront, it's a good time to own high-quality retail-centric real estate.\nLet me now turn it over to Dan before opening it up to your questions.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Another strong quarter of bottom line FFO growth despite higher interest costs. Even with the headwinds, stronger POI has driven almost 4% FFO growth both to the third quarter and 2023's first 9 months. $1.65 per share beat consensus by $0.03 and was $0.02 above the upper end of our guidance range.\nWith respect to this continued strong performance, we can point to the following drivers: higher property-level POI than forecast driven by higher min rents as we got tenants open ahead of forecast and kept tenants in [indiscernible], higher overage percentage rent and specialty leasing, higher term fees than we forecast as well as lower property level expenses. Despite the offset of higher interest costs and higher G&A, as you can see, we had another very, very strong quarter.\nWith respect to our comparable metric, POI growth was 3.8%. On a cash basis, comparable POI growth, excluding term fees, prior period rent was also 3.8%. Year-to-date through the first 9 months cash basis comparable POI, ex term fees and prior period rents stands at 4.6% at the upper bound of our expectations and will result in an increase in 2023's outlook for that metric, which I will touch upon later. This helped contribute to an overall POI growth of 7% for the third quarter and 7.5% year-to-date.\nTerm fees in the comparable pool this quarter were up $2.4 million versus $1.3 million in the third quarter of last year. Prior period rent this quarter was down to $900,000 versus $1.7 million in the third quarter of '22, basically awash these 2 adjustments. Details for term fees and prior period rent in the quarter are disclosed in our 8-K.\nYear-over-year occupancy showed continued progress with our overall occupied metric landing at 92.3% and our lease percentage at 94.0%, both metrics meaningfully higher than we had forecasted due to strong leasing and our team's efforts to get tenants open and rent paying.\nNet of the negative 100 basis points occupancy impact from the Bed Bath departures during the quarter, our occupied metric grew by 50 basis points, and our lease metric grew by 70 basis points. As a result, our signed-not-occupied percentage in total stands at over 250 basis points for $27 million, comprised of roughly $17 million of incremental total rent in our existing portfolio with an additional $10 million in total rent in our noncomparable pool, where leases are signed and the space is to be delivered.\nWe emphasized the strong quarter of operable retail leasing with 11% cash rollover and 21% rollover on a straight-line basis, which was achieved with meaningfully less capital than we've historically seen despite having a significantly higher share of new leases signed during the quarter, which was largely caused due to mix as last quarter, we had a high percentage of renewals. [indiscernible] improvements and landlord work per square foot for these new leases came down meaningfully to $41 per square foot and resulted in a blended $31 per square foot, including renewals.\nStrong new leasing activity was evidenced by 61 new deals totaling 423,000 square feet retail leasing, representing 75% of the volume for the quarter with more than half of this leasing for space that was [indiscernible] at June 30, a big driver of the strong occupancy gains in the third quarter net of the Bed Bath departures.\nHistorically, Federal's disclosed leasing volume, rollover and capital metrics have been reflective of arm's length negotiated transactions and therefore, have not included option exercises. Options are one way for the tenant, and they also do not have any capital associated.\nIn an effort to continuously improve our disclosure, we have expanded the retail leasing schedules and our 8-K to include the option exercise. We had 482,000 square feet of options exercised this quarter, which incidentally had solid rollover of 9% but more importantly, bring our total reported capital number from $32 per square foot in total down to $17 per square foot when including these options exercise. This expanded disclosure can be found on Page 23 of the 8-K supplement. And note that we have also highlighted what percentage of total leases signed each quarter are comparable.\nOur trailing 12-month average is 95% by number and 97% by GLA, which we believe present a more comprehensive picture for the investment community, particularly for rollover.\nNow to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we maintained $1.3 billion of total available liquidity, comprised of $1.2 billion available under our revolver and roughly $100 million of cash.\nWith respect to our leverage, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio held steady at 6x, and we continue to expect it to be back into the 5s in 2024. Our in-process $750 million pipeline of active redevelopments and expansions, a competitive advantage for Federal given its scale as only $180 million to spend against our $1.3 billion of available liquidity with a large chunk of that remaining figure being leasing capital, which is good news when deployed. This pipeline should continue to drive incremental POI into '24, to '25 and into '26.\nNow on to guidance. We are increasing our forecast for FFO per share for 2023 up to a range of $6.50 to $6.58, up from the previous range of $6.46 to $6.58. Guidance now reflects 2023 FFO growth over 2022 of 3% to 4%, 3.5% at the midpoint.\nWe have managed through retailer bankruptcies to date extremely well. And as I previously have discussed, we have relatively small exposure to expected near-term retailer pullout.\nOur credit reserves will likely come in lower than the originally fully loaded 100 to 135 basis points range that we provided with a revised credit reserve at 85 to 95 basis points. The dip in occupancy we expected this quarter was much less than forecasted as 2 of our buybuy BABY locations and only 1 of our Christmas Tree Shop locations went away and were assumed coupled with strong performance on accelerating rent commencements and the aforementioned strong leasing volumes for the quarter.\nFrom a comparable growth perspective, given the solid first 9 months, we are increasing a 2% to 4% comparable POI growth range, up to 2.75% to 3.75% and the 3% to 5% range for comparable POI growth adjusting for prior period events and term fees to 3.75% to 4.75%.\nOn a cash basis, adjusting for prior period rent term fees, we're increasing our 3% to 5% outlook up to 4% to 5%. Additionally, as discussed previously at length, we expect to continue to capitalize interest expense for Santana West for the balance of this year and through at least 2024 and have refined our G&A assumption down to $51 million to $53 million for the year. As always, we have provided an updated summary of the key assumptions for our guidance on Page 27 of our [indiscernible].\nWith respect to 2024, we will provide guidance in detail on our 2023 year-end call in February. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. And special thanks to David Simon for finishing his call more or less on time this afternoon. All-time record-setting quarter for Federal Realty this time with $1.67 second quarter FFO per share result ahead of consensus, ahead of internal expectations and ahead of last year's second quarter. .\nBy the way, last year's second quarter was helped by a large termination fee from Amazon as they exited their brick-and-mortar bookstores. Ex termination fees, this quarter's bottom line FFO per share growth grew 5% despite significantly higher interest expense. That's a really strong quarter for us.\nLeasing velocity continues to be the highlight. We signed 107 comparable leases of 576,000 square feet at $35.34 a foot, 7% higher than the cash basis rent the previous tenant was paying in the final year of their lease, 19% on a straight-line basis. Demand was exceptional.\nWhen you include noncomparable leases, which, by the way, for us, largely relates to newly built out space on our redevelopment and development projects, along with our office leasing, we executed 135 leases in the second quarter for a very robust 652,000 square feet, representing $23 million of newly contracted annual rent. These are production numbers that lie well outside the averages over our very long history, and we'll go a long way towards offsetting the loss at Bed Bath & Beyond and Christmas Tree Shop income stream in 2024 until they're re-leased and rent paying.\nIn terms of Bed Bath, we lost 1 of our remaining 9 Bed Bath leases during the quarter. That lease, a 25,000 square foot box at [ Mont Burnon Plaza ] in Northern Virginia, has been re-leased to Burlington at a 57% rent increase. Three more Bed Bath leases were rejected effective June 30 and July rent was received on the remaining 5. 2 of the remaining 5 were buybuy BABY locations that were assumed by online baby retailer Dream on Me, and we, therefore, expect to continue to receive rents in the future.\nThe remaining 3 leases were rejected in the third quarter, and accordingly, we'll have a hit to occupancy of about 1% and lost rent of $2.5 million or so for the balance of 2023, all of which has been considered in our guidance. Deals are in the works for all of our Bed Bath locations and replacement rent will start to ramp up in late 2024.\nBoth leased and physical occupancy continued to improve compared with the previous quarter and the previous year. 94.3% leased, a 92.8% physical occupancy at quarter end are up 10 and 20 basis points, respectively, compared with the first quarter and 20 and 80 basis points, respectively, year-over-year.\nSmall shop occupancy gains, in particular, continued their trend during the quarter and increased 20 basis points on a lease basis and 40% on an occupied basis. That's a total increase in small shop occupancy of 310 basis points since Q1 '22. The quality of our small shop tenants and the discerning way that we choose them at our properties is where we create a ton of value. All small shop vacancy or tenancy rather is not created equal.\nI've noted in the past couple of quarters that leasing productivity and rate that have occurred at the properties we've acquired over the past several years has significantly exceeded our underwriting and that has continued. Similarly, leasing productivity at properties that have recently undergone redevelopment and/or property improvement plans have outperformed our expectations, and we expect that to continue, means that maybe we can be a bit too conservative at times.\nThe roughly 3,100 apartments that make up an important part of the revenue stream at our mixed-use and other properties remain a real differentiating bright spot for our portfolio and continue to add to both cash flow and to value. In the aggregate, our residential portfolio was 98% leased at June 30 and provided 11% more property operating income this quarter than compared with the last year's second quarter.\nResi is a super important component of our mixed-use neighborhoods as is the office component, which is also 98% leased outside Santana West and the Choice headquarters building, which is under construction. We did, by the way, deliver the newly built out office space to Choice Hotels this quarter and expect them to finish their work and occupy the building by year-end. Sodexo in the same building will follow right behind.\nI reported last quarter that inquiries and property tours have seen renewed life at Santana West, and that has certainly continued. Even the Northern California press is starting lower layoffs and dramatic new investment and hiring in areas like AI, electric vehicles and related technologies. Feels like Silicon Valley is stabilizing.\nSo I look back and I think about what it is that we're doing, and I kind of tell you that some of the country's most productive and well-known mixed-use communities sitting just outside San Jose, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Miami seem to us, seem to me, be the right on the mark of the product that is and will remain in high demand as resilient consumers continue to prove that to be so.\nLet me turn it over to Dan before opening it up to your questions.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Reporting a company record FFO per share of $1.67 is very satisfying, particularly given the interest rate headwinds we faced and is a testament to the continued strength of our business model. To reiterate Don's earlier comment, we beat our previous record of FFO in the quarter last year by 5% when adjusting for the outsized term fees that we had last year and also posted 5% sequential growth versus the first quarter, again, a strong indicator of the health in our underlying business. .\nWith respect to this record performance, which significantly exceeded our expectations, we can point to the following drivers: higher property-level POI than was forecast driven by continued strength in rents, parking, specialty leasing and percentage rent, coupled with lower operating expenses as well, as a continued focus on cost controls at the corporate level resulting in lower G&A. This was offset by the aforementioned higher interest costs. As you can see, a very strong quarter.\nWith respect to our comparable metric, POI growth was 4.6%, excluding the impacts of term fees in the prior period rent. On a cash basis, comparable POI growth, excluding term fees and prior period rent was even better, 4.7%. Term fees in the comparable pool this quarter were down significantly to $1.6 million versus $5.5 million in the second quarter of last year and prior period rent this quarter was $1.2 million versus $2.2 million in the second quarter of '22. Again, please note, all of these figures are disclosed in detail in our supplemental 8-K on Pages 10 and 11.\nYear-over-year occupancy showed continued progress with our overall occupied metric growing 80 basis points year-over-year from 92% to 92.8% and our lease percentage increasing 20 bps from 94.1% to 94.3%. Small shop momentum continued year-over-year with a 90.2% rate being up 90 basis points over the previous year with a targeted lease rate for small shop of 92%. Our signed not occupied percentage in total stands at approximately 3% or $34 million, comprised of roughly $17 million of incremental total rent in our existing portfolio and an additional $17 million of total rent in our noncomparable pool, where leases are signed and the space is to be delivered.\nOur noncomparable signed nonoccupied pool is an important differentiator of Federal's business plan, which is often overlooked. Total comparable leasing volume for the quarter of 576,000 square feet, a federal record for a second quarter and the second highest volume for a quarter ever on a comparable basis. The rollover at 7% on a cash basis and 19% on a straight-line basis highlights the straight-line growth that's driven by sector-leading contractual rent bumps, which for our entire portfolio averaged roughly 2.25% blended across both anchor and small shop.\nNow to the balance sheet. At June 30, we stood with $1.3 billion of total available liquidity comprised of $1.2 billion available under our revolver and $100 million of cash. During the quarter, we successfully demonstrated access to the unsecured market at attractive levels with a $350 million 5 3/8% green bond, our second green bond, highlighting our focus on sustainability and our commitment with respect to our overall ESG strategy. Make sure to check out our annual corporate responsibility report on our website that was published in early June.\nWith respect to leverage, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to improve each quarter, and we fully expect to be back to our targeted level in the mid-5x in 2024. Our in-process $750 million pipeline of active redevelopments and expansions has only $220 million remaining to spend against our $1.3 billion of available liquidity, with a large chunk of that remaining figure being leasing capital, which is good news when deployed.\nNow on to guidance. We are increasing our forecast for FFO per share for 2023 by $0.04 per share at the midpoint to $6.52 from a range of $6.38 to $6.58 per share to a new range of $6.46 to $6.58 per share. Guidance now reflects 2023 FFO growth over 2022 of about 2% to 4% or 3.2% at the midpoint.\nWe have managed through bankruptcies to date in the retail sector extremely well, collecting more rent from Bed Bath than we had forecasted and having relatively small exposure to other retailer fold out. As the Bed Bath bankruptcy winds down, we expect it will result in a 31 basis point hit for the year versus our initial credit reserve of 25 to 60 basis points.\nWith respect to the balance of our tenancy, we are setting that reserve at 50 to 75 basis points. We will see a dip in occupancy next quarter as the impact of our lost Bed Bath locations and 1 Christmas Tree shops become fully reflected but expect to finish the year back in the low to mid-92% range.\nAlso keep that impact in mind for the cadence of FFO per share for the balance of the year, with third quarter forecasted at $1.61 at its midpoint and the fourth quarter at $1.65 at its midpoint.\nFrom a comparable growth perspective, given a solid first half of the year, we are affirming the 2% to 4% range for comparable POI growth as well as our 3% to 5% range on a cash basis adjusting for prior period rents and term fees. Given our focus on cost controls, we lowered our G&A forecast from $54 million to $52 million -- $52.5 million at the midpoint, and we increased our forecast for contributions from redevelopments and expansions to $16 million to $19 million, up from the previous range of $15 million to $18 million. We have provided an updated summary of these key assumptions on our guidance on Page 27 of our 8-K.\nBefore I close my prepared remarks, allow me to highlight that for the 56th consecutive year, Federal's Board of Directors increased our dividend, a REIT industry record. As the sole dividend king in the real estate sector, we are extremely gratified to have stayed the course through yet another challenging economic cycle and continued providing our shareholders with comfort in reliably growing stream of cash flow. Please note that the CAGR over these 56 years is 7% compounded.\nAnd now I'm finished with my prepared remarks, and let me turn it back to Don Wood for the completion of his remarks.\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Dan. As I listen to Dan's conversation and comments there, I thought one more point that I really I wanted to make. There's so much conversation about the supermarket part of our business and part of the industry and how good that is, but I want you to know about our mixed-use communities. I spoke about the overall outsized performance of the 4 -- big 4 mixed-use communities last quarter, but it bears repeating as its strength continued and helped drive the results in the second quarter. .\nTaken together, Assembly Row, Bethesda Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row are a real company differentiator for Federal, as you know, and more in demand than ever before, with retail leased occupancy at 98% and tenant sales well above 2019 levels. These properties are humming with estimated foot traffic in excess of 30 million shoppers in the trailing 12 months. That's a big number. And it comes from the database of place for AI, which we think is well understated. In our estimation, this is the product in the market that consumers in a post-COVID world want the most.\nSo despite the well-publicized bankruptcies of companies like Bed Bath and Christmas Tree Shops and the effects of higher interest rates on our business, I'm feeling pretty darn good about the way this year is playing out, and that's been the basis for which we could increase guidance by as much as we did this quarter.\nLet's now turn it over and open it up to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes these expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this afternoon, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. Strong start to 2023 here with $1.59 first quarter FFO per share results, ahead of both consensus and internal expectations and 6% growth over last year's first quarter. Also happens to be the best first quarter result we've ever posted. Here's the best part. We signed 101 comparable leases for more than 0.5 million square feet at $34.72 a foot, 11% higher than the cash basis rent the previous tenant was paying in the final year of their lease, 24% on a straight-line basis. Demand was exceptional with momentum encouragingly strong at the end of the quarter, late March.\nAs you know, I've been expecting the inevitable tail off of leasing activity for months and months now as the portfolio leases up. These activity levels exceed historical levels by 20% to 30%, we just plainly haven't seen that tail off yet. The retail demand for the product that we offer is in lockstep with what today's consumers and retailers demand in these affluent [ first-ring ] suburbs of major metropolitan areas. One of the larger drivers of that leasing performance this quarter was the signing of 4 grocery deals, 3 new deals and renewals. The renewal was [indiscernible] [ dead implied ] in the Boston suburb with Star Market and Albertsons brands. The new deals included Giant Food replacing Shoppers Food Warehouse, [ Karin Plaza ] and [ SiberBaltimore ], a grocer that I'm not allowed to announce yet replacing Michaels at Fresh Meadows and Queens and Aldi replacing Barnes & Noble on Long Island.\nTogether, these 4 deals turned $3.3 million in base rent or $17.81 a foot to $4.4 million in base rent or $23.40 per point. Strong rents and rent growth in proven productive centers in Northeast densely populated suburbs. The timing of them all getting done in the first quarter bodes well for the future. The Bed Bath bankruptcy filing news will not exactly welcome, was inevitable and frankly, better than the [ band data ] is being write-off so that we can get on with creating incremental value in our shopping centers. There are many more productive retailers than this one that should be serving our customers. Deals are in the works for all of our Bed Bath boxes and replacement rent should start to ramp up in late 2024. With average Bed Bath base rent at $15 a foot, rest assured that Federal's portfolio will be more valuable, not less once these locations are [ retended ]. Dan will provide more detail on what we've assumed in our numbers.\nThe natural lease expiration of a large-format Bed Bath & Beyond store at Wynwood Shopping Center in suburban Philly closed in January as expected and was the primary cause of a modest 20 basis point drop in occupancy in the quarter. That closure, along with a Tuesday morning in suburban Boston, it also closed when the lease expired in January, fairly overshadowed the many store openings elsewhere throughout the portfolio. Meanwhile, small shop occupancy gains continued on a [indiscernible] quarter and increased 50 basis points. That's a total increase in small shop occupancy of 270 basis points since Q1 2022. The quality of our shop tenants and the discerning way that we choose them at our properties is where we create a ton of value. All small shop tenancy is not [indiscernible] And as much as I love the grocery deals I mentioned earlier, it's the retail side of the big 4 mixed-use communities that I find most impressive. Taken together, Assembly Row, Bathesda Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row are a real company differentiator for Federal and more in demand than ever before, with retail leased occupancy at 98% and tenant sales well above 2019 levels.\nThese properties are [indiscernible] with estimated foot traffic in excess of 28 million shoppers in the trailing 12 months. That's a big number and comes from the database of [ Placer AI ]. Roughly 2/3 of tenants report sales of big 4, so the numbers are representatives. Overall sales per foot totaled $700 with total food and beverage sales per foot in excess of $1,000. In our estimation, this is the product and the markets that consumers in a post-COVID world want the most. I know you've heard me say it many, many times before, but fair to repeat it. Demographics made, especially in times of economic pressure and especially now at the $5.5 trillion of government stimulus that propped up the economy during the papers is waning. Past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with average annual household income of $150,000 sit within 3 miles of Federal Realty centers.\nThat's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a 3-mile route-mile radius and more than half of those people have a 4-year colleagues agree or better. I know no other significantly sized retail portfolio back in same. With the late quarter on the transaction flow, where we sold a small grocery-anchored shopping center in the quarter for $13 million, [indiscernible] center located in very suburban [ Newberg ] in Pennsylvania as one of the latest 3-mile population demos in our portfolio with an obvious candidate for sale.\nMore interesting was our acquisition of the fee interest and the anchor tenant leases at Huntington Square Shopping Center on Long Island from [ Seritage ] Realty Trust for $35.5 million. Back in 2010, we had purchased a leasehold interest in the shop tenants with the hopes of someday finding a way to consolidate the anchors and the fee. With this first quarter transaction, we now fully control this 18-acre parcel in affluent East North Fort Long Island. And as I mentioned earlier, we just replaced Barnes & Noble with an Aldi grocery store you're creating another grocery-anchored property in the portfolio. With a $5 million-plus annual income stream on our $56 million all in investment, we've created a much more valuable property with an unlevered IRR in the low teens and arguably $20 million plus of immediate incremental value.\nYou might have also noticed that after the quarter's end, we refinanced our $275 million in bonds coming due June 1, with a new 5-year $350 million green bond at 5.375%. The offering was significantly oversubscribed with demand helped by our lead gold or better investments. Next up will be the financing or refinancing of our $600 million bonds coming due next year. we would expect to be opportunistically in the market at [ 400 ] points in the second half of this year. For an additional source of growth in 2021 and beyond, you only need to look at $600 million plus of construction and process on the quarter-end balance sheet to identify a large source of future income and capital already invested, Much of it lease is not yet reflected in the results. What was reflected in the quarterly results was a $10 million property operating income contribution from the latest completed phases of some of our mixed-use operating properties, namely Assembly Row Phase III, 009 Roads at Pike & Rose and a full quarter, a stabilized [ cocoa wall ], which contributed.\nAnd finally, our floor-by-floor buildout at Santana West seems to be attracting more interest in the marketplace as inquiries and property tours have seen renewed life in the last 30 to 60 days. Tech sector in Silicon Valley is far from settled, but the increased activity is certainly well. We continue to see our fully amenitized office space on our mixed-use communities to be the product of choice in their respective markets. Okay. That's about it for my prepared remarks this morning, and I'll turn it over to Dan before opening it up to your questions.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our $1.59 per share of reported FFO was a first quarter record for Federal and probably above our expectations [ and ] last year's $1.50 results, representing a 6% annual increase. That our performance again was broad-based as all facets of our business continue to contribute. Specific drivers, which deserve mentioned, overage percentage rent continues to outpace expectations as [indiscernible] sales demonstrate strength and resiliency.\nParking revenues also saw gains above forecast as customer traffic at our large mixed-use assets continues to drive higher. Small shop occupancy again showed gains and we saw lower expenses both at the property and corporate level. This was offset modestly by higher collectibility impact or bad debt expense was forecast. Our GAAP-based comparable POI growth metric was 3.6%, coming in at the upper end of the range of our 2% to 4% initial guidance. On a cash basis, comparable excluding prior period rent term fees is 5.2%. Cash basis comparable minimum rent grew by 4%.\nTerm fees in the comparable pool this quarter were essentially flat to first quarter 2022 and $1.4 million in each period. Prior period rent this quarter was $1.3 million versus $2.4 million in the first quarter last year. Please note that we have added all of these figures to Pages 10 and 11 of our 8-K supplemental disclosure. You're welcome, Steve. Year-over-year occupancy results were also solid with our overall occupied metric growing 140 basis points year-over-year from 91.2% to 92.6% and our lease percentage increasing 50 basis points from 93.7% to 94.2%.\nSequentially, we took a small anticipated step backward given 1Q seasonality and two known anchor partners in January at lease expiration, which were reflected in our guidance. Our signed not occupied spread in the existing portfolio stands at 160 basis points as we continue to show progress in getting tenants open and rent paying. This spread represents roughly $18 million of incremental total rent. Our sign not occupied in our non comparable pool stands at $18 million as well for the total rent, bringing total signs nonoccupied to $36 million.\nThis effectively brings our SNO percentage to a total of 3%. These executed leases will continue to drive bottom line results over the next 2 years, with roughly 65% coming online over the remainder of 23% and the balance primarily in 2024. When you include new lease deals in our pipeline for currently unoccupied space, this increases the SNO figure even higher. Rollover for the quarter was 11% on a cash basis and 24% on a straight-line basis, the second consecutive quarter to have the cash number in double digits and a straight line number up into the low to mid-20s.\nI highlight the straight line number as it reflects sector-leading contractual annual rent increases -- embedded rent increases embedded in our leases, both anchor and small shop blended at roughly 2.25% across the portfolio. Year-to-date, small shop rent bumps have averaged about 3%. Now to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $1.3 billion of total available liquidity at quarter end, comprised of $1.2 billion available under our revolver and $100 million of cash. As many of you saw, we successfully accessed the unsecured market subsequent to quarter end with $350 million, of [ 5 and 3 ] [indiscernible] bond, and as a result, no maturities until early '24.\nAlso, keep in mind that for our term loan, whose initial maturity is also in 2024, we have two 1-year extensions at our option, taking the maturity into 2026. With respect to our leverage metrics, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is roughly 6x as noted, and we fully expect to be back to our targeted level in the mid-5x in 2024. Additionally, we are targeting free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital to return to pre-COVID levels by next year. Our in-process pipeline of active redevelopments and expansions now stands at $740 million, with only $250 million remaining to spend against our $1.3 billion of available liquidity.\nNow on to guidance. With initial guidance to start the year showing FFO growth of 2.5% at the midpoint and 4% at the top of the range. and a solid first quarter under our belts, we are affirming guidance for 2023 at $6.38 to $6.58 per share. While we continue to see strength and resiliency in our business, with 3 quarters left for the year, it is rare that we would modify guidance at this point in the year. For the first time in almost 2 years, we are seeing tenant bankruptcies in retail. As selective businesses struggled to compete in a challenging economic environment of higher interest rates and diminished government subsidies [indiscernible]\nDespite the bankruptcies to date where [indiscernible] very manageable exposure, we still feel comfortable with our initial 100 to 135 basis points of total credit reserve comprised of roughly a 75 basis point general reserve and a 25 to 60 basis points of specified Bed Bath reserve. Now given where we started May and the expected range of outcomes, this Bed Bath reserve has now been reduced to 20 to 45 basis points given the cash rents we've already received on 8 of our 9 anchor boxes that have not yet been projected, including May rent. That range will depend on the timing of the bankruptcy process and which leases are affirmed and/or assumed, if any.\nFrom a comparable growth perspective, given a solid first quarter metric, we are affirming the 2% to 4% range for comparable POI growth as well as our 3% to 5% range on a cash basis adjusting for prior period rents and terms. Page 27 in our 8-K provides an updated summary of the key assumptions for ours. Now in addition to the expanded disclosure on term fees and prior period rent that I previously highlighted, we'll also notice several other additions to our 8-K relating to revenues, comparable POI growth, debt, occupancy and leasing metrics, demonstrating our commitment to continuing to expand our disclosure to provide the information we believe is most relevant for investors to analyze our business effectively and efficiently.\nAnd with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. Ms. Brady, you may begin.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVP of IR, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may materially differ from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this afternoon, our annual report on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur conference call tonight will be limited to 60 minutes. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nCEO & Director, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nWell, thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. We ended 2022 on a very strong note and reported FFO per share of $1.58 in the quarter and therefore, $6.32 for the full year, ahead of both internal and external consensus, expectations and a precursor to the strong guidance that great real estate with class-leading demographics will allow us to forecast.\nWe're more than a year ahead of where we thought we'd be in recovering from the depths of the pandemic in terms of leasing, occupancy and bottom line earnings. We executed a record 497 leases for over 2 million square feet of retail space in 2022, and the comparable deals were done at 6% more rent on a cash basis and 15% more rent on a straight-line basis than the leases that were expiring. We did that while simultaneously increasing our inherent contractual rent bumps to over 2.25% annually overall. And by the way, based on what we see looking forward into 2023, at this point, while I doubt that we'll do 497 leases again, I would expect a higher lease rollover percentage in 2023 as continued strong demand and inflationary pressures are helping negotiations.\nWe leased up the portfolio at 94.5% at year-end compared with 93.6% a year before and still have room to further increase in 2023. Most importantly, that intensified focus we've been talking about over the last year or so aimed at minimizing that difference between percentage leased and percentage occupied, i.e., getting tenants rent paying more quickly, well, it's working. While our percentage leased continues to grow, up 90 basis points in 2022, our percentage occupied is growing even faster, up 170 basis points in 2022, suggesting some of the quickest times between lease signing and rent paying in our history, a particularly impressive feat during the supply chain struggles of the past 2 years. So all of these things resulted in 2022 FFO per share of $6.32, 13.5% higher than the year before and right on top of our prepandemic record.\nI know you've heard me say it many times before, but it bears repeating. Demographics matter, especially in times of economic pressure. Past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with annual average household incomes of $150 to $1,000 sit within 3 miles of Federal real -- centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a 3-mile radius, and more than half of those people have a 4-year college degree or better. I know of no other significantly sized retail portfolio that can say that.\nSo it's manifesting itself in a myriad of ways, including a wide variety of tenants who saw their sales exceed the percentage rent threshold in the lease in the fourth quarter. While not a huge absolute number since we strive for strong fixed rent in our leases, the broad-based percentage rent contribution in the quarter, particularly among our restaurants and soft goods tenants, over and above the fixed rent is notable and contributed an additional $0.02 per share compared with last year's fourth quarter and is a continuation of the trend that we've been seeing all year.\nNow as economic activity falls and higher interest rates affect everything from car loans to mortgage payments, to deal underwriting, we would certainly expect to see a slowdown in consumer spending, which very well may cause retailer reticence and a slowdown in the period. Hasn't happened so far. Leasing -- that kind of change is pretty obvious. But that's okay. This business remains more solid. And if history is any indication, Federal's real estate will outperform given that superior demographics, along with a very strong diversification of rent. No one tenant makes up more than 2.8% of our rental stream, and that tenant is TJX.\nTo put a finer point on that, when you think about today's troubled tenants, Bed Bath, Party City, Rite Aid, Tuesday Morning and even Regal Cinemas, of which we have no exposure, all of them combined comprise less than 1% of our 2023 forecasted rental stream. Average in-place base rent at our 9 Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY locations is $15 a [full], rents that will be more than replaceable as we navigate through the expected bankruptcy process with them.\nWe continue to opportunistically prune the portfolio of noncore and slower-growing assets. And in the fourth quarter and the last few days of the third quarter, we sold 3 smaller properties, all in Maryland, for proceeds of about $135 million at a combined flat 5% cap rate: one, a legacy residential community from Federal's earliest days; the second, a Federal-developed residential building on excess land in Towson, Maryland; and the third, one of our earliest small retail developments in Rockville, Maryland. Those and earlier sale proceeds were reinvested into assets like Kingstowne and The Shops at Pembroke Gardens, which are generating better going-in yields and have significantly better growth process.\nThe ability to sell noncore assets accretively is just one of the differentiating tools that we have to manage this company through economic cycles. And of course, you only need to look at the $600 million-plus construction and process number on the year-end balance sheet to identify a large source of future income, much of at least not yet reflected in the results.\nOkay. So that's about it for my prepared remarks this afternoon, so I'd like to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. The run-up in interest rates will surely pressure everybody's earnings to some extent in the years ahead, ours included, beginning in 2023. Dan will go through the expected impact in a few minutes. But keep in mind that Federal has been around since 1962 and has raised its dividend every year since 1967. This business plan doesn't need money to be virtually free to thrive. It's proven that.\nIn terms of 2023, know that significant incremental rent from contracts that are already in place, particularly where demand is strongest at our mixed-use operating properties like Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Santana Row, Darien and CocoWalk, along with a full year of contributions from 22 acquisitions, will more than cover incremental interest and lead Federal to what we believe will be an all-time record earnings year in 2023 with sector-leading growth.\nDan?\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.58 for the fourth quarter and $6.32 for the year were up 7.5% and 13.5%, respectively, versus 2021. For both periods, we're at the top of our previously increased guidance range. Primary drivers of the outperformance: acceleration in occupancy up to 92.8%, a gain of 70 basis points for the quarter and 170 basis points for the year. Other drivers: higher percentage rent, which more than doubled in 2022 versus the previous year; and continued strength in consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets, driving parking revenues higher. This was offset by higher property operating expenses and higher interest expense.\nComparable growth, our GAAP-based metric for same store, in the fourth quarter and the full year came in at 5.4% and 7.7%, respectively, strong metrics despite the negative net impact of prior period rents and term fees. On a same-store cash basis, we came in at what we believe to be a sector-leading 5.5% for the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Excluding the negative impacts of prior period rents and term fees, cash same-store growth was 7.8% and 10.8% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.\nFor those analysts and investors to keep track, we had $1.1 million of term fees for the fourth quarter against a 4Q '21 level of $1.7 million. Prior period rent contributions related to COVID-impacted negotiated yields were $2 million this fourth quarter versus $4 million in the fourth quarter of '21. And please note that in our investor presentation on our website, there are updated slides plus an appendix which provide all of these figures.\nDon already highlighted continued strength in leasing, but let me point out a few more statistics of note. The 94.5% and 92.8% in leased and occupied metrics represented growth of 90 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, over 2021 and 20 and 70 basis points of sequential growth over the third quarter. We continue to see strength in our small shop leasing, which now stands at 90%, a level not seen since 2017, but still short of our targeted and historical peak levels. The 80 basis points of relative pickup in our SNO spread over the course of 2022 demonstrates our ability to get tenants open and rent paying. More upside to come in 2023 as we target an SNO spread at more typical levels of 100 to 125 basis points long term.\nI mentioned leasing activity has been strong to start 2023, and our pipeline of deals executed to date in the first quarter and those under executed LOI is in line so far with 2022's strong leasing volumes. Additionally, we remain optimistic that we can continue to drive favorable lease terms in 2023, including both strong lease rollover growth and sector-leading contractual rent bumps. A big driver of our growth in 2022 was the continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline. We expect that to be the case in 2023 as well.\nHaving placed $800 million of projects into service in 2021 and 2022 at Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and CocoWalk, we saw a $24 million of incremental POI in 2022. We expect another roughly $12 million of incremental POI in 2023 just from those 3 projects alone. The balance of our development pipeline now stands at roughly $730 million, which will deliver incremental POI starting this year and continue for the next few years but is less than $300 million remaining to spend.\nNow to the balance sheet and a quick update on our liquidity position. We ended the year with $86 million of cash available and an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility for a total liquidity in excess of $1.3 billion. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong. Fourth quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA is roughly 6x. That metric is forecasted to improve over the course of 2023 as development POI comes online and occupancy drives higher. Again, our targeted level is in the mid -- is in the low to mid 5x range. Fixed charge coverage was 3.7x for the fourth quarter and 4x for the full year.\nNow on to guidance. For 2023, we are introducing FFO guidance of $6.38 to $6.58 per share. This represents 2.5% growth at the midpoint of $6.48 and 4% at the high end of the range. Despite the challenging capital markets environment and embedded headwinds, as promised, Federal will grow in 2023. This is driven by a comparable growth forecast of 2% to 4%. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.8% at 12/31, up above 93% by year-end 2023, although that progression will not be linear throughout the year. Additional contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline will total $15 million to $18 million. And for those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K on Page 16 and 17 where we provide our forecast of stabilized POI and timing by projects.\nAccretion from our 2022 acquisitions being online for a full year will also contribute. Those $500-plus million of 2022 acquisitions are expected to outperform our original underwriting by at least 50 basis points. This will be offset by lower prior period collections with a net 2022 level of $9 million, which is expected to fall to a range of $4 million to $6 million in '23. And lower net term fees, we had $9.5 million in 2022 and forecast $5 million to $6 million in 2023, more in line with our historical averages. Despite over 100 basis points of headwinds, our comparable growth forecast is 2% to 4% for 2023. It would be 3% to 5% without the headwinds from prior period rents and term fees. Quarterly FFO cadence, we'll have 1 quarter being the weakest with sequential growth thereafter.\nOther assumptions include $175 million to $200 million of spend on redevelopment and expansions at our existing properties; $175 million to $225 million of common equity issued throughout the year, refinancing our $275 million of unsecured notes, which mature in June in the mid-5% range; G&A in the $52 million to $56 million range for the year; and capitalized interest for 2023 is estimated at $20 million to $22 million, which includes the continued capitalization of interest at Santana West, given our change in leasing strategy from a single tenant leasing approach to a multi-tenant building as we build out tenant floors and add tenant amenities.\nDispositions completed in '22 contributed roughly $5 million of POI during the year. That POI will not be there in '23. We've assumed a credit reserve, excluding the impact of Bed Bath & Beyond, of roughly 75 basis points. And with respect to Bed Bath, we are adding another 25 to 60 basis points of reserve depending on the uncertain outcome with respect to this tenant. Please note, in 2023 and moving forward, we have less than 70 basis points of exposure as our Wynnewood location had a natural expiration in January 2023 and has not been on our '23 forecast since mid last year.\nAs is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2023, except what has already been announced. We will adjust for those as we go given our opportunistic approach to both. This guidance also does not assume any tenants moving from cash basis to accrual basis revenue recognition. Please note, the expanded disclosure in our 8-K on Page 30 provides a detailed summary of this guidance.\nAnd before we go to Q&A, let me take a minute to highlight the strength and the outperformance that our signature mixed-use retail assets demonstrated in 2022. The big 4 of Santana Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Bethesda Row, took a disproportionate hit during COVID because of government shutdowns in their respective markets, but they now sit, they finished 2022 at 99% leased. Reported retail sales were 15% to 20% higher than the prior year and are back up above pre-COVID levels. Consumer traffic was up 20% versus the prior year and 7% above pre-COVID levels. Comparable retail POI at these assets were up 30% versus 2021 and over 6% above pre-COVID levels. Plus, we are forecasting comparable growth in retail POI for 2023 of 6% to 8% of these 4 assets given continued strength in leasing demand.\nThe retail components of our mixed-use assets are unique and have driven and should continue to drive POI growth materially above that of a typical open-air shopping center, providing an additional point of differentiation between Federal and its peers. Further, our operational mixed-use capabilities in design, construction, leasing, operations are unrivaled and a unique competitive advantage moving forward in the continued evolution of open-air retail, capabilities that are applicable across our entire retail portfolio and a big reason why we expect that sector-leading retail growth for years to come.\nAnd with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVP of IR, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood; Dan G.; Jeff Berkes; Wendy Seher; and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters contained on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this afternoon, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial conditions and results operations.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nCEO & Director, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nWell, thanks, Leah, and hello, everyone. Well, consumer spending remains very strong in the major submarkets where Federal operates, particularly in our mixed-use properties, and has resulted in another quarter of outperformance in terms of both executing long-term leases as well as bottom line earnings. 126 executed long-term leases for 585,000 square feet of space and FFO per share of $1.59 were both above external and internal expectations and continue to signal strong demand for high-quality retail and mixed-use real estate.\nThe future pipeline of deals not yet executed also remains robust, and as such, we'll be raising 2022 guidance again.\nDemographics matter, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with annual average household incomes of $150,000 sit within 3 miles of Federal Realty Centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a 3-mile radius, and more than half of those people have a 4-year college degree or better. I know of no other significantly sized retail portfolio that can say that.\nIt's manifesting itself in a myriad of ways, including a wide variety of tenants who are seeing their sales exceed the over-trend threshold in the lease. And while not a huge absolute number, since we strive for strong fixed rent in our leases, the broad-based over-trend contribution in the quarter, particularly among our restaurants and soft goods tenants, over and above the fixed rent is notable and contributed an additional $0.02 per share compared with last year's third quarter.\nAs I said, strong core leasing remains the engine that drives us. Over the last decade, pre-COVID, that's 2010 through 2019, average third quarter production for comparable properties at Federal meant doing 88 deals or just over 400,000 square feet. In the 2022 third quarter, we did 119 deals for 563,000 square feet, 40% more than the average.\nAnnual rent bumps of our retail leases averaged about 2.25% overall and higher when including office leases. That's a powerful advantage over the typical shopping center portfolio.\nThe fact that demand has remained this heated with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volume and better properties and the markets they're in and naturally, about future property level operating income growth. It's one of the reasons Dan is again raising annual earnings guidance $0.12 at the midpoint.\nThe solid tenant performance also manifests itself in continued occupancy gains as tenant failures remain low. Our current year lease rate is now at 94.3% and occupied rate now at 92.1%. Those leased and occupied rates are 150 and 190 basis points, respectively, better than a year ago, and there's obviously still room to grow there, particularly on the small shop side. At 89.9% leased, small shop space is a remarkable 640 basis points higher than the COVID low point, with further gains expected by year-end.\nI referred earlier to the outsized demand that we see at our mixed-use properties. Note that the retail component of our four large ones, Assembly, Pike & Rose, Bethesda and Santana, are 98% leased at quarter's end. In addition, we continue overall to hit or beat targeted delivery dates, one of our key corporate goals for 2022 and a real tribute to our tenant coordination and construction teams.\nI'm as convinced as I've ever been that we have the right product in the right locations with the right demographics for the inflationary economy that we're in. And by the way, with a well-demonstrated 55-year respect for the dividend component of our total return, a dividend yield of 4.3% for a portfolio of this quality seems awfully compelling to us.\nAnd against that backdrop, we've also been able to sell a couple of noncore assets at good pricing and refinance and upsize our term loan and line of credit to be sure that we have plenty of balance sheet flexibility and dry powder for whatever the economic environment feels like in 2023.\nIn terms of capital needed for our large development projects, we have less than an incremental $225 million to go. About $100 million to complete the Choice Hotel Headquarters building at Pike & Rose; $100 million largely for 10 build-out commissions at Santana West; and $20 million to complete Darian Commons. By the way, after the quarter, just last week, we just signed a 52,000 square foot lease with a credit tenant bringing that building at Pike & Rose to over 60% pre-leased.\nThose projects alone will be contributing an incremental $40 million in operating income in years to come. Investing in these and other projects, both large and small, with fixed-rate debt and equity before the recent rise in rates will serve us well in the coming years as these state-of-the-art buildings begin cash flowing.\nSimilar to development, our pro rata share of the acquisitions that we've made since the beginning of COVID through today totaled $850 million. Those acquisitions from Grossmont to Camelback Colonnade, to Pembroke Gardens and so forth are performing well ahead of our expectations in the aggregate and are expected to yield in the mid-6s in 2023.\nIn that same time period, we generated over $400 million in proceeds from noncore asset sales at a sub-5 cap. That capital recycling was not only immediately accretive, but the medium- and long-term growth rates of our acquisitions, net of dispositions, are clearly superior.\nOkay. That's about it for my prepared remarks this morning, though, I'd like to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. In our view, the recent run-up in interest rates was inevitable, but not necessarily at the pace we're seeing. While sure to pressure everybody's earnings to some extent in the years ahead, how much so and for how long remains to be seen. So the real question is, will property level operating income more than compensate? These are the times when well-leased, well-located dominant retail and mixed-use centers in supply-constrained affluent, densely populated markets and submarkets shine.\nWe're in a cyclical business, no news to anyone. And it's why our business plan has always included multiple ways to counter the rise in money costs and the effects of inflation. The combination of best-in-class shopping centers along with acquisition and development property level income contributions financed with money from an earlier time, along with the potential sale of certain assets, including discrete residential buildings within our portfolio, gives us more flexibility and more tools with which to handle cyclical pressures than most.\nWe look forward to the challenge. Dan?\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. For another quarter, strength and resilience of our portfolio has exceeded expectations. With FFO per share of $1.59, we beat a strong comparable from third quarter of 2021 by over 5% and beat consensus by $0.06.\nAnd once again, we saw broad strength across all aspects of our business driving this performance. Continued gains in small shop occupancy; strong tenant sales driving higher percentage rent; continued increases in customer traffic resulting in another uptick in parking revenues; strength in our residential assets; and better collections than forecast, although offset by higher property level expenses and higher interest.\nLet me add some color to these items. Small shop-leased occupancy basically hit 90%, up 60 basis points over 2Q, up 380 basis points year-over-year and up to a level not achieved since 2017, but still not back to targeted levels.\nParking revenues, a strong indicator of consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets, continued higher, up 8% sequentially over 2Q and 33% year-over-year.\nPercentage rent, an indicator of tenant sales strength, was up over 31% sequentially and almost double third quarter 2021's level.\nSame-store residential POI was up over 10% year-over-year.\nOn the other side, we did start to see some inflationary impact in operating expenses in the quarter as OpEx grew by 10% over 3Q 2021. However, we estimate that roughly 1/3 of that increase is nonrecurring and it is all predominantly recoverable from tenants.\nDespite coming off a strong comp in '21, our comparable growth metric for 3Q was a solid 3.7%, well above forecast. Comparable growth, excluding prior period rent and term fees, was 6.3%. On a cash basis, our same-store metric is 5%. Excluding prior period rent and term fees, our same-store metric is up to 8%. Year-to-date, comparable POI growth is a sector-leading 8.8% and almost 10% on a cash-based same-store metric.\nFor those of you that track it, term fees this quarter were $1.3 million, up from $0.5 million in '21, but down significantly from the second quarter's $5.6 million. Prior period rent was $2 million, decreasing $4 million relative to the third quarter's $6 million level. Again, this is adjusted to reflect only negotiated prior period rent payments relating to COVID-19.\nWe had another exceptional quarter of leasing, a record for any third quarter, giving us 9 consecutive quarters of above-average leasing activity and not by a little bit, by over 25% on average over this 9 quarter period and 40% this quarter. Furthermore, our pipeline remains as robust as we've seen it, currently exceeding both second quarter of 2022, third quarter of 2021 levels at this juncture in the quarter.\nOur rent rollover metric was 3% for the quarter, with rollover gains for deals in our pipeline, indicating a much more robust outlook in future quarters. We also had another solid quarter achieving sector-leading rent bumps as we continue to drive average annual contractual increases of 2.25% for retail leases only, full banker and small shop blended. And as a result, our rollover on a straight-line basis is 13%.\nAnd I know I'm repeating myself, but for every 100 basis points higher in annual rent bumps, the ending rent will be 9% to 10% higher at the end of a 10-year lease. Hence, a portfolio with 2.25% rent bumps and 3% rollover is the equivalent of a portfolio with only 1.25% rent bumps and 12% rollover. Plus the 2.25% rent bump portfolio collects more along the way.\nWith respect to our balance sheet, we made significant progress during the quarter in enhancing our liquidity and financial flexibility. Just after quarter end, we closed on a comprehensive refinancing which increased our unsecured bank capacity by over $0.5 billion from $1.3 billion previously to $1.85 billion today and a combined revolving credit facility and term loan, both of which we expanded.\nWe increased our previous $1 billion revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion, extending the term to April of 2027 with 2 6-month options out to 2028. And transitioned the base rate from LIBOR to SOFR, and we doubled the size of our existing term loan from $300 million to $600 million. This term loan has an April 2024 maturity with 2 additional 1-year extension options, which take us out to 2026 at our option.\nThe interest rate here also transition from LIBOR to SOFR. As a result, at closing of the facilities, we had $1.4 billion of total liquidity, including the $1.25 billion available on our undrawn credit facility.\nWith respect to leverage metrics at quarter end, our net-debt-EBITDA ratio is roughly 6x annualized for the quarter and adjusted for asset activity, comfortably within the range of our ratings and we continue to target a ratio in the low to mid-5x over time.\nOur fixed charge coverage ratio rests at 4x. And additionally, we sold 2 assets, 1 retail center and 1 residential asset, during the quarter for a total of $67 million at a blended 5.25% cap rate.\nAnd we're in process on an additional asset -- on additional asset sales totaling over $350 million in potential proceeds at a blended cap rate that is sub-5%. Having noncore assets, including residential that we can sell at extremely attractive valuations even in this environment is an arrow in our quiver that most retail companies do not have.\nOn to the remainder of 2022. Given another quarter of outperformance and a strong outlook for 4Q, we are increasing our guidance from $6.10 to $6.25 to a tightened range of $6.27 to $6.32 per share, an increase of $0.12 at the midpoint or 2%. And this is on top of 2 other guidance increases earlier this year in the first half, which bring our year-to-date total increases in guidance to $0.45.\nCurrent 2022 guidance implies 13% growth over '21 at the midpoint despite over 200 basis points of headwinds from prior period rent. We are also bumping up our forecast for comparable POI growth to 7% to 8% from the prior range of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding prior period rents and term fees, our comparable POI forecast increases to 9% to 10% from the prior range of 7.5% to 9%. We continue to expect our occupied rate decline from 92.1% today, up to around 92.5% by year-end. And please note that our recent third quarter acquisitions weighed on our occupancy growth during the quarter.\nThis guidance assumes a range of $1.53 to $1.58 of FFO per share for the fourth quarter.\nWith respect to 2023, we will be giving formal guidance on our call in February, but let me provide some commentary for you to consider.\nOur $600 million term loan is floating rate. We have consciously decided not to hedge the rate to maximize our financial flexibility to be opportunistic in the timing of refinancing on a longer-term fixed rate basis. Its interest rate is set at term SOFR as adjusted plus an 85 basis point spread, which is 4.7% today. Also note, while our only debt maturity in 2023 is $275 million of unsecured notes with the June maturity, it does have a 2.75% interest rate. We again expect prior period rents and term fees not to contribute from 2023 to the level they did this year, although the impact will not be as material as it was this year.\nAnd G&A, which is running at $13 million per quarter currently, is expected to increase in 2023 using -- use $14 million per quarter as a good placeholder for now.\nAs a counter to these trends, our core business continues to show significant strength. Given over 2 years of above-average leasing volumes with relatively little impact from failing retailers over the last year, we expect to see POI in 2023 continue to show strong momentum, driven by solid comparable growth continuing in 2023 in the existing portfolio, driven by 220 basis points of signed, not occupied upside and a robust current portfolio of new leasing as well as growth in the noncomparable portfolio, particularly at the recently stabilized Assembly Row Phase III, a 100% leased 909 Rose at Pike & Rose and the 100% leased CocoWalk.\nDespite uncertainty in the economic outlook for 2023, POI growth will be robust and should provide momentum to counter inflationary pressures and higher interest rates.\nAnd with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and an appropriate follow-up during the Q&A portion of our call. (Operator Instructions).\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nCEO & Director, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. An all-time record quarter for us in a number of important respects, none more important than bottom line earnings. At $1.65 per share of FFO, the 2022 second quarter handily beat our previous record of $1.60 posted 3 years ago in the second quarter of 2019. Even when adjusting for COVID one-timers, second quarter FFO per share matched that previous high watermark.\nLots of things going very well here at Federal. We did more deals both on a comparable basis and overall in those 90 days than we've ever done in our company's 60-year history. We continue to lease up our development pipeline and increase our occupancy percentage. We ended the quarter at 94.1% leased. We've added multiple new strategic properties to our portfolio that have clear paths to future growth. And our balance sheet remains strong with $177 million of cash on hand and $0 drawn on our $1 billion line of credit at quarter end.\nAs we've been saying all along, the execution of our multifaceted business plan, which, in these uncertain times, does not rely on a big bet on any one particular income stream, continues to set us up extremely well for the future. The quality of our assets, combined with our sector-leading demographics and high barrier markets, tend to outperform through economic cycles, as has been the case every time in the last 25 years.\nSo check this out because we did just get new demographic data in as of August 1. So within 3 miles of our centers, there are 175,000 people on average, that's 68,000 households ,68,000 households, right? $150,000 of average household income. That equates to $10.2 billion of spending power within 3 miles of our shopping centers. And more than half of those people have a 4-year college degree or better. Who else can say that? It's about that spending power that's critical in uncertain times, in my view.\nAnd cyclicality of the economy is far different than the unprecedented restricted market shutdown due to a global pandemic. They're different. Perhaps the best way we can demonstrate our confidence in the portfolio is by standing behind and, in fact, raising our dividend to shareholders just as we have each and every year since 1967. 1967, that's 55 years, a totally unprecedented track record among REITs and among most companies in any industry, one that speaks to the commitment to our owners and to the quality of the income stream. At an annualized rate of $4.32 a share, that's a 4.1% dividend yield at the current share price, pretty darn strong for a company of this quality.\nOkay. Let's start with leasing during the quarter. Over the last decade, average second quarter production for comparable properties at Federal meant doing a little less than 100 deals for just over 400,000 square feet. In the 2022 second quarter, we did 132 deals for 562,000 square feet, nearly 40% more than the average. And we've never come close to doing 132 deals in any quarter.\nBut the fact that demand has remained this heated with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volumes about our properties and the markets that they're in and naturally about future earnings growth. So one of the reasons Dan is again raising annual earnings guidance $0.23 at the midpoint.\nSo one of the more underappreciated phenomena of the strong demand is that we're able to be more proactive in terms of leasing space that's not yet vacant. While that leasing doesn't immediately show in the occupancy stats, it will mean less downtime in the future and shopping centers that are merchandised with more relevant tenants sooner than they would otherwise be.\nThe portfolio was 94.1% leased and 92% occupied at quarter's end with continued improvements expected by year-end, particularly on the small shop stop. At 89.3% leased, small shop space is a remarkable 580 basis points higher than the COVID low point.\nOur stepped-up post-COVID reinvestment effort is another critical component to future growth. It's no news to anyone on this call that the traditional generic and homogenous shopping center business is cyclical in nature and not a high-growth business. So you have to stand out to outperform over cycles. You do that by picking the right markets and positioning and merchandising in those markets, but you also have to reinvest to continually find the edge.\nReinvesting is more important now than ever before. It's why we have nearly 2 dozen active and meaningful development projects in planning or underway, totaling over $100 million this year and next, which will likely yield double-digit unlevered yields over the ensuing years through higher customer traffic and rents, in line with our historically observed results following property improvement projects. That reinvestment is one of the primary reasons we can continue to push rents.\nLeasing has been exceptionally strong at our newly development assets also, from the completion of CocoWalk to the office projects at Pike & Rose, to the residential over retail at Darien, to the residential and office Phase 3 at Assembly Row, each of these additions have exceeded our post-COVID expectations in terms of lease-up pace. In the case of the residential product at Assembly, that's exceeded in both pace and rental rate.\nNow the one exception is Santana West, and there's no question that the cooling of the technology sector in the last 90 days, both in terms of their stock prices and getting employees back into the office has been a wet blanket on what had been strong leasing momentum. It has therefore been difficult to bring fully negotiated deals over the transom.\nDisappointing, yes, but important proper perspective, having a brand-new state-of-the-art office building adjacent to one of the most successful amenity-rich destinations in the tech capital of the country, isn't so bad. Particularly, since it only represents about 2% of Federal's asset value and will be an important driver of future growth when it hits. It's a matter of time. Stay tuned.\nWe've also remained active on the acquisition front. Following the end of the quarter, we completed the all-cash acquisitions of 2 very special properties in 2 of the markets where we're focused on expansion. The Shops at Pembroke Gardens, a 392,000 square foot dominant retail center on 41 acres at the corner of I-75 and Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines, Florida as an important asset to our portfolio, 8 miles south and west of our equally dominant Tower Shop Center in Davie and 20 miles north of our newly completed and highly acclaimed CocoWalk mixed-use destination in Coconut Grove.\nOur ability to remerchandise and push rents potentially add density down the road and fortify federal as a must-talk-to-player in South Florida were all considered in this important acquisition. The $180 million purchase will generate better than 5% return in year 1 with a very strong going forward NOI growth that will produce an IRR well in excess of our cost of capital.\nAcross the country in Scottsdale, Arizona, we were able to acquire the 214,000 square foot office building directly adjacent to our Hilton Village property, giving us over 1/3 of a mile of continuous -- contiguous frontage on Scottsdale Road immediately across the main entrance to Paradise Valley, the region's most affluent, in our view, underserved community.\nThe integration and rebranding of these properties as one, along with the proximity of work, home and retail and restaurant amenities in this post-COVID environment is expected to allow us to create a seamless, modern environment that will support greater rents and higher long-term occupancy. This $54 million acquisition will yield 6% in year 1. And like Pembroke, is expected to provide very strong NOI growth that will produce an IRR well in excess of our cost of capital.\nThese 2 acquisitions, along with the previously announced 410,000 square foot Kingstown shopping center, in Northern Virginia, represent a combined investment of $435 million at a 5.25% yield in year 1 and more importantly, very strong IRRs on 3 dominant retail destinations in 3 particularly fast-growing markets from a good jobs perspective.\nOkay. It's about it from my prepared remarks this morning, though, I want to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. Investing decisions grow tougher as economic uncertainty increases, and real estate investing is clearly a cyclical business. It's why the underlying business plan of this company has always contemplated cycles in its investment strategy. These are the times when well-leased, well-located dominant retail and mixed-use centers in supply-constrained, affluent, densely populated markets and submarkets shine. Whatever it is to come economically over the next couple of years, Federal is well positioned to outperform. Dan?\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don outlined, the record $1.65 per share reported FFO for this quarter blew way our expectations and consensus by over 10%. As in the first quarter, our outperformance was across all aspects of our business, continued gains in small shop occupancy; stronger performance in our residential portfolio; surging parking revenues and gains in percentage rent; underscoring continued momentum in consumer traffic and tenant sales; higher collections than forecast, both in the current and prior period; and larger term fees, offset by higher G&A and interest expense. While some of these items can be considered timing related or nonrecurring, the lion's share of this outperformance is driven by continued strength in our in-place portfolio, which drove another increase in our guidance.\nLet me spend a little time here highlighting some metrics, which demonstrate this strength, led by our dominant mixed-use properties. Near-record parking revenues, a strong indicator of consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets, was a near record $3 million for the quarter, up 80% over second quarter 2021 levels and up 25% sequentially over the first quarter.\nPercentage rent, an indicator of tenant sales strength, was up over 90% on a comparable basis and up 18% sequentially on a rolling 12-month average. With respect to specific tenant sales metrics, at Assembly Row, reported tenant sales were up 13% over 2019 pre-COVID levels and are up 10% sequentially on a rolling 12-month basis versus first quarter.\nAt Santana Row, tenant sales were up 13% over 2019, with traffic up despite the impact from work from home. The (inaudible) tenant sales were up 9% over 2019. And Pike & Rose, reported sales are up over 5% versus 2019 levels with consumer traffic of almost 10%. These data points all serve as a testament to the relative strength of the consumer in our high income, highly educated, densely populated high barrier markets. Again, markets that have demonstrated resilience over cycles and the ability to outperform during cyclical downturns. Very different than the pandemic-related market-specific government shutdown.\nAs a result, our comparable portfolio growth metric was again sector-leading at 8.2% for the quarter. Comparable growth, excluding prior period rent and term fees, was 9.5%. As we highlighted last quarter, a cash basis same-store metric would have been 9% and 10.5%, excluding prior period rent and term fees.\nTerm fees this quarter were actually up, up to $5.6 million versus $3.4 million in 2021. Prior period rent was down to $3 million versus $6 million in the second quarter of '21 as adjusted to reflect only COVID-19-related prior period rent payments.\nYear-over-year occupancy results were also strong as our overall occupied metric grew 240 basis points year-over-year from 89.6% to 92%, and our lease percentage increased 140 basis points from 92.7% to 94.1%. We should continue to see upside in those metrics as we realistically target 94% to 95% for occupied and 95% to 96% for leased.\nAs we have now had 8 consecutive quarters of above-average leasing activity, we are continuing to see strength, and we're continuing to see strength in our leasing pipeline as it's never been this full. The volume of deals in process are up 15% versus pre-COVID 2019 levels and are as strong as they were last year at this time when we had a record year of leasing volume.\nWhile deals in the pipeline still need to be brought to completion, demand is broad-based across tenant categories as best-in-class retailers all look to expand and upgrade their real estate footprints within Federal's best-in-class portfolio. And again, we had strong solid quarter achieving sector-leading rent bumps. And we continue to drive average annual contractual increases in the 2% to 2.5% range across all our leases, anchor and small shop.\nNow let's review the math once again. For every 1 percentage point more in annual rent bumps, the ending rents in year 10 will be 9-plus percent higher over a 10-year lease, plus you are collecting more rent along the way. Contractual rent increases do matter.\nWith respect to our residential portfolio, it now stands at 98.5% leased on a comparable lease basis and 97% leased overall when you include the new 500-unit Miscela building at Assembly Row, which we expect to stabilize this quarter. We hadn't expected Miscela to stabilize until late fourth quarter and it is now achieving higher rents and lower concessions than we had underwritten. And despite this competition from the new 500 units next door, our existing Montaje Residential Tower at Assembly is almost 100% leased and saw a 23% rental increases during the second quarter.\nNow on to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity. At June's quarter end, we had $1.2 billion of total liquidity with an undrawn $1 billion revolver and $177 million of cash. Additionally, we have over $400 million of noncore dispositions under consideration with pricing expectations at a blended cap rate in the sub-5% cap range.\nWe closed out our remaining forward equity this quarter, issuing $177 million of common stock at a net price of $120 per share, further bolstering our liquidity. With respect to our leverage metrics at quarter end, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now down to 5.8x annualized for the quarter as we continue to target a ratio in the low to mid-5x range over time.\nOur fixed charge coverage ratio increased to 4.3x, comfortably above our targeted level, and 93% of our outstanding debt remains fixed rate. Our significantly derisked $700 million of in-process pipeline of active redevelopments has $340 million remaining to spend, much of that being tenant improvement dollars tied to tenant leases.\nNow on to guidance. Given the comprehensive outperformance during the quarter across all aspects of our business, we are increasing our guidance by roughly 4%. That's $0.23 at the midpoint to a tightened range of $6.10 to $6.25. $0.01 to $0.02 of the $0.23 increase is from our recent purchase of Scottsdale Forum in Phoenix, The Pembroke Gardens in South Florida and their roughly half year contribution to 2022. The balance is from another quarter's outperformance and a better-than-forecast outlook for the rest of the year in both the comparable and noncomparable pools.\nThis guidance assumes ranges of $1.48 to $1.55 of FFO per share for both the third and fourth quarters, which reflects an increase over our previous guidance for those quarters. We are also bumping our forecast for comparable POI growth to 5.5% to 7% from the prior range of 3.5% to 5%, a 200 basis point increase for the metric. Excluding prior period rents and term fees, our comparable POI forecast increases to 7.5% to 9% from the prior range of 6.5% to 8%.\nWhile the cadence may be a little choppy, we continue to expect our occupied rate decline from 92% where it is today, up into the 92.5% to 93% range by year-end. As we continue to get tenants open on time, and on budget overall, a testament to the capability of our legal leasing, tenant coordination and property operating teams.\nNow I don't want to just highlight those specific groups at Federal, let me take a little bit of time to thank and congratulate all 320 employees at Federal for their tremendous effort over the last 2-plus years working intelligently, creatively, and tirelessly through an unprecedented -- the unprecedented challenges of COVID, but also for driving to achieve a record quarter in funds from operations for the company.\nFor many of us here at Federal, it really means something to be part of a company that stands alone in the REIT sector with a 60-year public history, coupled with a 55-year track record of increasing dividends. In celebration of both of those milestones, members of the Federal team will be ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange this afternoon.\nAnd lastly, during the quarter, we released our annual corporate responsibility report. It's available on our website. I encourage all to give it a read to appreciate the long-standing and established commitment to sustainability, our communities, our corporate culture, and our strong governance practices that we have at Federal.\nAnd with that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

Welcome to the Federal Realty Investment Trust First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVP of IR, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your call -- take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nForward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but a future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask you to limit yourself to 1 question and an appropriate follow-up during the Q&A portion of the call. (Operator Instructions).\nAnd with that, I will turn our call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nCEO & Director, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThanks, Leah, and good morning, everybody. There's lots going right in Federal Realty these days. Demand for our products has outpaced even our raised expectations and 2022 first quarter was no exception. Yes, the reported -- the reported $1.50 per share, beat both the street and our internal forecast. And of course, last year's COVID impacted quarter by 28% but it's really the contributions from all parts of this multifaceted business plan that's at the heart of our optimism, starting with the enduring strength of leasing.\nOver the last decade, average first quarter production for comparable properties at Federal Realty meant doing about 80 deals or roughly 375,000 square feet. In the '22 first quarter, we did 119 deals for 444,000 square feet, 50% more than the average. We've never come close to doing 119 deals in any quarter, never mind the normally weaker first quarter, before last year's record-setting COVID recovery demand. But the fact that, that demand has remained this huge with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volumes about our properties and the markets they're in. And naturally of our future earnings growth.\nThanks, Leah, and good morning, everybody. There's lots going right in Federal Realty these days. Demand for our products has outpaced even our raised expectations and 2022 first quarter was no exemption.

And of course, last year's COVID impacted quarter by 28% but it's really the contributions from all parts of this multifaceted business plan that's at the heart of our optimism, starting with the enduring strength of leasing.\nOver the last decade, average first quarter production for comparable properties at Federal Realty meant doing about 80 deals or roughly 375,000 square feet.

We've never come close to doing 119 deals in any quarter, never mind the normally weaker first quarter, before last year's record-setting COVID recovery demand. But the fact that, that demand has remained the sedan with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volumes about our properties and the markets they're in. and naturally of our future earnings growth.\nSo one of the reasons Dan is raising annual earnings guidance, $0.10 at the midpoint of the first quarter, something we rarely, if ever, do. That leasing demand is broad and has resulted in a 130 basis point increase in small shop lease percentage 88.7% sequentially over the fourth quarter, well ahead of expectations. That small shop lease rate is also a remarkable 490 basis points higher than a year ago. Now we did lose 40 basis points of [EDGAR] occupancy since the fourth quarter. That's just typical first quarter expirations of few boxes portfolio (inaudible). The portfolio was there for overall 93.7% leased at the top at the end of the first quarter.\nImportantly, there's plenty of room to go. We expect continued small shop occupancy gains throughout 2022. So all of this commentary thus far relates to our core portfolio, and it doesn't speak to the multiple additional ways that we grow earnings and value. Selective acquisitions, development, redevelopment, all add incrementally to our best-in-class core portfolio. Here's a case in point. We did 10 deals, both new and renewals in the first quarter at the 4 properties that we bought last year, Chesterbrook, Camelback Collonade, Hilton Village and Grossmont. The rent rolled up in every single 1 of those deals and overall up by 33%. And even though no redevelopment has started yet at any of those centers. The universal belief during those tenant negotiations was that federal would improve the productivity of those shopping centers, enabling them to afford higher rents. That reputation and credibility grounded in a long established track record is critical to all that we do and in my view, 1 of our key differentiators.\nWhen we tied up Fairfax County, Virginia Kingstowne Shopping Center for $200 million in a 5 cap some months back, we similarly expect to improve the productivity of that 410,000 square foot destination through better merchandising and operations and finding the inevitable opportunities that always seem to accompany big land parcels. This one is 45 acres in densely populated in affluent first-ring suburbs.\nAs I assume you read in our press release a couple of weeks back, we closed on the first half of that parcel in late April and expect to close on the second half in late July. Northern Virginia is an important and a growing market for us. Our stepped-up post-COVID redevelopment effort is another critical component to future growth. It's no news to anyone on this call that the traditional generic and homogenous shopping center business is cyclical in nature and not a high-growth business. So you have to stand out to outperform over cycles. You do that by picking the right markets and positioning and merchandising in those markets, but you also have to reinvest in those assets to continually find the edge.\nReinvesting is more important post COVID than ever before. So why we have nearly 2 dozen active and meaningful development projects in planning are underway, totaling over $100 million this year and next, which will likely yield double-digit unlevered yields over the ensuing years through higher customer traffic and rents in line with our historically observed results following redevelopments. That reinvestment is 1 of the primary reasons we can continue to put push rents.\nNow as to our development business. At the Citi conference in March, we were able to tour live in person CocoWalk, our fully leased mixed-use development. We had an impressive group of investors attend and our team was proud to showcase the unique approach that we take to real estate development and value creation. Consider that in its first stabilized year, the project will generate in excess of $11 million of NOI on a $190 million investment with rents that are already under marked.\nOur unlevered IRR is over 8%. CocoWalk is pretty special. At Santana West, while I don't have any specific announcement to make on this call as to the leasing of our newly constructed office building, interest in the product and negotiations are more active than they've been at any time during the COVID era. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to provide a positive update in the coming months. Office demand is back in Ernest in Silicon Valley given the Google and Apple back-to-office announcements in the past month or 2 and we have the only new fully amenitized state-of-the-art project in the market. We've updated costs and returns on the accompanying 8-K based on real negotiations and market conditions. Ensure higher costs, along with higher rents, thus maintaining yield expectations.\nWith residential base rents comprising 11% of our total rented base, the upward pressure on apartment rents in many U.S. markets is also benefiting our bottom line. A meaningful residential income stream in our fully amenitized properties is such a unique incremental benefit of Federal. At Assembly Row, lease-up of Miscela, our 500-unit apartment building continues faster than forecast and a higher net effective rents. We're currently 70% leased at 10% higher rents than forecast.\nOur office building, affectionately known as the PUMA building, as you can see the PUMA site from New Hampshire is now 88% leased with another 5% at [lease]. Assembly Row has really outperformed all of our expectations coming out of COVID. Nothing yet to announce with respect to the next phase of expansion here as we've yet to lockdown costs, but we are getting close to a go/no-go decision on a life science project here that complement the growing life science demand and adjacent Summerville projects. More to come.\nPike & Rose, Darien construction both continue on time and on budget. One thing that always strikes me about our mixed-use development pipeline is the extent to which we incorporate what we've learned over the years into our core portfolio. While mixed-use development is certainly a different business than operating 4 shopping centers, much of what makes our big development special can be seen throughout our portfolio. From a broader array of tenant relationships to state-of-the-art construction techniques relative to place making, storefronts, any coordination and environmental considerations to unseen but impactful operational efficiencies. Our 25-year experience building mixed-use communities adds and continues to benefit our core shopping centers far greater than most people realize.\nExpect to be more -- see more of our showcasing that in the coming quarters and years. When you think Federal Realty, think about the multifaceted ways that we've got to grow. Just as we did between 2010 and 2019, and just as we plan to do from 2021 on with assets in the team whose confidence is proven and time tested.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don outlined, $1.50 per share reported FFO for the first quarter outperformed against every one of our benchmarks. Last quarter, year-over-year, versus consensus and versus our own forecast. That outperformance was broad-based. All aspects of our business model played a role in the results of drivers such as better-than-expected small shop occupancy stronger residential performance, particularly in Boston and San Jose, better improvement in collections than forecast both in the current and prior periods, growing parking revenues and percentage rent underscoring accelerating traffic and tenant sales, particularly at our large mixed-use assets.\nHowever, this was offset by higher-than-forecasted property expenses. Our GAAP-based comparable portfolio growth metric was exceptionally strong at 14.5% for the quarter, more than 3% above forecast. Comparable growth, excluding prior period rent and term fees was 18.5%. To emphasize the strength of these metrics relative to the broader sector, our cash basis same-store metric, as calculated in line with our peers would have been 18% on an apple-to-apple basis and 18-plus percent excluding prior period rent and term fees. Term fees this quarter were $1.5 million versus $2.8 million in 1Q '21. Prior period rent this quarter was $5 million versus $8 million in '21. Year-over-year occupancy results were also strong with our overall occupied metric growing 170 basis points year-over-year from $89.5 million to $91.2 million, our lease percentage increasing 190 basis points from 91.8 to 93.7.\nMore upside to come on both of those metrics in the coming years as we realistically target 94% to 95% were occupied and 95% to 96% for leased. Our signed not occupied spread in the comparable pool held steady at 250 basis points representing over $24 million of incremental total rent, which should come online over the balance of this year and into 2023. In our noncomparable pool are designed not occupied upside stands at $19 million of total rent.\nNew lease deals and our leasing pipeline are currently unoccupied space will drive another $12 million of incremental total rent, primarily in '23 and '24. This totals roughly $55 million of cumulative incremental rent, which will very visibly drive bottom line results over the next 2-plus years, highlighting the diversity and strength of our multifaceted business plan. As a testament to our asset management and tenant coordination teams, we have not seen any material delays in getting tenants open and paying rent due to supply chain issues or labor issues to date, further enhancing the timeliness of that income coming online.\nRollover for the quarter was solid at 7%, in line with our expectations and our trailing 4-quarter average as we continue to take a long-term approach to leasing up our portfolio in the wake of COVID and look to balance driving occupancy, improving merchandising, enhancing tenant credit quality, increasing starting rents and importantly, getting strong practical rent bumps. Contractual rent bumps are an extremely important part of our business plan, one that is not always visible to our investments.\nWe believe that we achieved sector-leading average contractual rent bumps anchor and small shop lended and the 2.25% range given the quality of our portfolio. In this quarter, the blended annual increase releases signed with an exceptional 2.5%. From a pure math perspective, 2.5% compounded over 10 years, results in a rent which is 9% higher in year 10 than a lease, which compact -- the compound at 100 basis points slower growth or 1.5% annually. It's not just about rollover, contractual rent bumps do matter.\nNow to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of total available liquidity comprised of an undrawn billion dollar revolver, $160 million of cash and $175 million remaining on our forward equity contract. Additionally, we have roughly $150 million of noncore dispositions under consideration with pricing expectations that have blended cap rate below 5%. We have no maturities in 2022 with our only near-term maturity being $275 million of unsecured notes, which mature in mid-2023. We've reduced our encumbered pool to just 7 assets, increasing our unencumbered EBITDA to 93% of total EBITDA or $600 million. With respect to our leverage metrics, our net debt to EBITDA is inside of 6x as adjusted for our forward equity, we fully expect to be back to our pre-COVID target of low to mid 5x by late '23.\nOur fixed charge coverage ratio is over 4x already above our targeted level, and 93% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. Additionally, we are targeting free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital to return to pre-COVID levels by next year. As CocoWalk in the Phase IIIs at both Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are largely complete from a spending perspective and are stabilizing $700 million comes out of our in-process development pipeline. These 3 projects will yield roughly $48 million when stabilized versus their 2021 contribution of $12 million. As a result, our in-process pipeline of active developments now stands at $800 million, with roughly $425 million remaining to spend. As we always do, we sit with significant dry power against our $1.3-plus billion of liquidity.\nNow on to guidance. As Don said, even after such a strong start to the year, it is rare that we would raise guidance for just 1 quarter in the books. However, the steady momentum we're seeing in the business makes it really difficult not to. As a result, we are pushing our guidance range of $0.10 to $5.85 to $6.05 from the prior range of $5.75 to $5.95. $0.01 to $0.02 of the $0.10 increase is from our recent purchase of Kingstowne and its contribution to 2022. The balance is from the first quarter outperformance and a better than forecast outlook for the rest of the year, in both the comparable and noncomparable boots.\nWe are also bumping up our guidance for comparable POI growth to 3.5% to 5% from the prior range of 3% to 5%. Excluding prior period rents and term fees, our forecast increases to 6.5% to 8% from a prior range of 6% to 8%. We still expect our occupied rate decline from 91.2% today, up until the 92.5% to 93% range by year-end. At the [SNO] spread in our operating portfolio of 250 basis points begins to come online.\nIn terms of FFO growth in '23 and '24, we are still comfortable with the 5% to 10% growth guidepost we didn't previously. The strength of our business model provides us with a diversity of avenues to grow sustainable sector-leading FFO growth Beyond driving portfolio occupancy levels back to our mid-90s targets, Federal has additional years to propel growth. A proven track record and cost of capital to opportunistically acquire assets accretively over the year, middle and long term, a completed redevelopment and expansion pipeline totaling $700 million an in-process redevelopment and expansion pipeline totaling $800 million. Together, these redevelopments and expansions will drive an incremental $80 million to $85 million of POI over the coming years through 2025. As we have highlighted previously, this is not pioneering development in a proven locations, this is redevelopment and derisked expansions at established and highly successful properties that we already own and know extremely well. On a risk-adjusted basis, there is no better, more compelling business plan in the sector today.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to your host, Ms. Leah Brady. Thank you, ma'am. You may begin.\n\nLeah Andress Brady\n\nVP of IR, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nA reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results included in guidance -- including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.\nThe earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued tonight, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our conference call tonight will be limited to 75 minutes. We finally ask that you to limit yourself to 1 question during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions, please requeue.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?\n\nDonald C. Wood\n\nCEO & Director, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Leah, and congratulations to you on your promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations this month. Really well reserved, and we're sure lucky to have you.\nWell, good afternoon, everybody. What makes Federal's business plan so different is our multifaceted approach to capitalize on these best located, best tenanted retail properties with a laser focus on bottom line earnings growth, 104 individual assets with a proverbial toolbox filled with numerous ways of achieving that goal for years to come. Took a global pandemic to knock us off our horse for a time, but we're back up and we're riding high.\n2021 was the first step where each quarter throughout the year exceeded our constantly upwardly revised expectations. That trend continued in the fourth quarter with FFO per share of $1.47 handily beating our forecast, and of course, last year. The shining star of the business continues to be leasing, as it's been a whole year, but it was taken to new levels in the fourth quarter. I need to put this into context, so bear with me for a minute.\nFirst, on a company-wide basis in the fourth quarter, we signed 149 commercial leases, that is retail and office but not including residential leases, which itself was really strong, for nearly 900,000 square feet of space. That includes renewals of existing tenants, along with space that (inaudible) sits vacant today, is expected to be vacant in the coming months or as for new buildings currently under construction or just completed. That's an annual base rent commitment of nearly $35 million.\nConsider that over the last 10 years, an average quarter's outlook produced about 110,000 commercial -- 110 commercial leases and 500,000 square feet. That means that in this quarter, we did 35% more deals or 80% more GLA than average. This is very strong quarterly volume even in a year where each previous quarter seemed to set some sort of record. And while I don't think that those fourth quarter levels are regularly repeatable, our leasing pipeline suggests that they will remain above historical averages for the foreseeable future.\nFor the full year 2021, we did 573 commercial leases for 2.9 million square feet and an annual rent commitment of $116 million. These activity levels are unprecedented over the very long history of this company. But this leasing volume is particularly important because it provides strong validation at the very diversified product type that we own and are creating very highly sought after. And the leasing is broad-based. It's the single biggest reason that I believe Federal Realty is better positioned post-COVID than we were before.\nLet me break down the quarter numbers a little bit more, and I think you'll see what I mean. Of the 149 commercial leases signed, 116 of them or nearly 600,000 square feet were for comparable space, one where a tenant previously operated from. Those leases were written at an average rent of $34.34, 6% higher than the tenants they replaced. Another 9 leases or 22,000 square feet were written for noncomparable space at an average rent per foot of $43.53 at places like Assembly Row Phase II, CocoWalk and Camelback Colonnade in Phoenix.\nBut it's the remaining 24 leases or 277,000 square feet at net rent of $48.52 that really is a strong positive differentiator to our business plan. It's the office leasing at our long-established mixed-use communities in this quarter, primarily at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose. Now look, I certainly realize that general office leasing does not evolve right now for good reason, given the macro levels of uncertainty surrounding back-to-work policies.\nBut not all office space is created equal, and it has become clearer and clearer with each quarter and each month that passes that the new Class A office product that we own or are building at 5 of our amenity-rich mixed-use communities is an extremely high demand and commanding rents that are clearly additive to both earnings and value. Each of those 5 are well-established retail locations already, and the office component is an expansion, building on the success of the retail. They are Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Bethesda Row, Santana Row and CocoWalk.\nThat's it. Deals with a myriad of companies and lots of different industries, headlined by our lease with Choice Hotels for their new world headquarters at Pike & Rose, are just the latest examples of company choosing our building as the product of choice open attended for the future. Those companies are joining others like Puma, Avalon Bay, NetApp, Bank of America and Splunk and helping to create long-term sustainable communities in our portfolios in Somerville, Massachusetts, Montgomery County, Maryland, Silicon Valley and Miami.\nAnd check this out. While 197,000 feet of the 277,000 feet done in the quarter was primarily a newly constructed buildings at Assembly and Pike & Rose, the remaining $80,000 was for comparable space at a positive 23% rollover. That strong rollover was largely driven by our first renewal and expansion at 450 Artisan Way at Assembly Row. The 100,000 square foot office building built as part of Phase I, that rent went from a blended sub-$30 triple net rent to the mid-40s triple net. Pretty good data point of the longer-term office upside that exists and well executed, well-amenitized mixed-use communities in first-tier suburbs.\nAs I said, and firmly believe all office opportunities are not created equal. And while we don't have anything to announce on this call at Santana West, there is serious interest from a number of substantial tenants where we're making some very good progress.\nAnd by the way, take a look at the occupancy gains we're making on the retail portfolio portfolio-wide, which are equally impressed. At year-end, we're 93.6% leased and 91.1% occupied. That's an 80 basis point lease and a 90 basis point occupied pick up in just 3 months, impressive for sure, but still a ways to go to get to our 95%-plus historical boat.\nOkay. So what about the Omicron impact? Well, as you would expect, there's little impact in the fourth quarter as the variant spread didn't take hold until late December and January. And what the impact will be on 2022 has yet to play out. But thus far in 2022, it feels like across the board, shoppers, tenants and other constituents seem to be viewing Omicron as temporary. And while wearing mask and being more careful in most of our markets, are marching forward with typical winter shopping patterns. Requests for rent accommodations from tenants at a few, and we've not agreed to anything significant at all at this time.\nNow from a capital allocation standpoint, which, after all, is really what we as management teams in this industry do to add the most value, we're actively using all 3 levers: asset sales, acquisitions and the continued expansion in our established properties, all in the name of bottom line earnings growth. You'll notice from our 8-K that we closed on the sale of 2 shopping centers where we saw limited upside in the future. The combined proceeds of $113 million in just Leeburg Plaza and Saga Shopping Center sold at a blended high 5% cap rate were used to reduce debt before year-end.\nOn the acquisitions front, we'd like to invest several hundred million dollars in 2022 based on our identification from our hit list of targeted properties that feel like they may trade this year. Progress early in the year has been encouraging and soliciting serious conversations. stay tuned.\nAnd certainly, on the development front, we expect to be substantially done constructing our residential of our retail neighborhood in Dairy Connecticut this year. We're underway at our $190 million office tower for Choice Hotels at Pike & Rose. And we have more than a dozen property improvement redevelopments underway throughout the portfolio.\nBy the way, Citi will be hosting a tour of our newly completed CocoWalk mixed-use project during their conference in South Florida next month. It's pretty spectacular. It's created over $60 million in value on our $200 million investment, and we'd love to see a wide variety of investments there. It's going to be an active year on all fronts at Federal. I got to believe the visibility of this multiple year bottom line earnings growth plan is the most transparent in the sector.\nThat's all about all I have for prepared comments. Let me turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that.\n\nDaniel Guglielmone\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.47 was up 29% from the fourth quarter of last year and roughly $0.06 above the top of our guidance range. For the year, we reported FFO per share of $5.57, a 23% increase over 2020's results. Both of those reported increases exclude the onetime debt repayment charge from 4Q 2020 in order to show a meaningful apples-to-apples comparison.\nPrimary drivers of that outperformance versus expectations were higher percentage rent from COVID-amended leases bolstering better collection rates; a faster acceleration in occupancy than expected; stronger leasing at our residential assets, including the Phase III residential assembly; lower real estate taxes than we had forecasted; plus financing activity, which occurred later in the quarter than expected. This was offset by higher G&A; higher property level operating expenses, primarily one-timers; and lower term fees than we forecasted. For those analysts that keep track, we had $1.7 million of term fees for the quarter against a 4Q 2020 level of $3.6 million.\nCollections continue to improve with 97% of monthly bill rent being collected for the quarter, up from 96% reported on our third quarter call. Including abatements and deferrals, we are 99% resolved. Prior period collections were down to $5 million versus $8 million in 3Q. And as a result, our collectibility adjustment was up modestly to $2 million, primarily driven by this prior period follow up. Collection of deferrals continue to outperform our expectations -- of the $46 million of total rent we deferred since the start of COVID. $27 million has been collected, which represents roughly 90% of the amounts that were scheduled to be repaid by year-end.\nDon already highlighted our record-breaking quarter and year of leasing, but let me add some additional color. As he mentioned, we were 91.1% occupied as of quarter end, a 90 basis point increase over both the third quarter and year-over-year. Our lease rate stood at 93.6%, an 80 basis point increase over the third quarter and 140 basis point increase year-over-year, and a 250 basis point spread between leased and occupied should set us up for strong growth over the course of 2020.\nThese significant gains were primarily driven by small shop leases. Our small shop lease percentage is up to 87.4%, a 130 basis point sequential increase in the quarter and a 280 basis point increase year-over-year. Solid progress in getting back to our targeted (inaudible) of around 90% to small shop. Highlighting some of the small shop activity for deals for some of the most sought-after tenants of today: Warby Parker with 3 new deals; Made Well with 2 new leases; on bet with 2; Oxra; Aged Denim, Both Pizza; another Nike Live; another Glass, just to name a few.\nAnchor leasing was solidly up 50 basis points to 96.8%, given broad-based activity with 12 deals totaling 320,000 square feet of the almost 600,000 for the quarter. Categories for new deals include grocers, discount apparel, sporting goods, home furnishings and health care.\nOn the residential side, we saw a surge in leased occupancy of 240 basis points year-over-year to 97.2% and saw a strong high single-digit year-over-year new lease rent growth. We feel well positioned to drive incremental POI growth in 2022, given forecasted strength, particularly in our Boston and Silicon Valley markets. Evidence of this plan -- evidence of this can also be seen where after just 7 months, our 500-unit Micellar Residential tower at Assembly is already 60% leased at rents which are 15% higher than the pre-COVID lease-up rental rates of Montaje, its sister resi tower next to it at Assembly Row.\nIn terms of redevelopment, we now have roughly $400 million of remaining spend on our $1.5 billion investment pipeline. Much of that pipeline has recently been placed into service. These projects will be a source of significant earnings growth in 2022 through 2025 as we continue to ramp up in POI contribution. In our 8-K, we have reinserted disclosure relating to the ramp-up of PLI at our large in-process projects and also provided some detail in a footnote on the 99% leased CocoWalk.\nNow to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. The fourth quarter was an active one on the capital markets front. We raised another $85 million of common equity for our ATM on a forward basis at a blended gross price of $130.50. We repaid mortgages totaling $117 million that encumbered the avenue of White Marsh and Montrose Crossing, getting another $18 million of POI to our unencumbered pool. And during the quarter, we sold $121 million in assets, including the Leesburg, Virginia, and Saugus, Massachusetts assets Don mentioned, bringing our total for the year to $142 million at a blended yield in the [mid-5s]. As a result, we ended the year with $162 million of cash available, an undrawn $1 billion credit facility at $264 million of forward equity to be taken down in '22, leaving us with total liquidity of over $1.4 billion.\nOur leverage metrics continue to improve. Net debt-to-EBITDA is now down into the high 5x level for the fourth quarter annualized net of the forward equity. And that metric is forecast to improve over the course of 2022 as development POI comes online and occupancy drives higher from leases that are already executed. Again, our targeted level is in the low 5 time frame. Fixed charge coverage is back up to just under 4x, and we have no debt maturities until mid-2023.\nNow on to guidance. For 2022, we are increasing our guidance range to $5.75 to $5.95 per share, a $0.10 increase over our previous range. This represents 5% growth at the midpoint, 7% at the high end. And this was driven by occupancy levels expecting to increase from 91% at year-end up into the mid- to upper 92% range by the end of 2022. An increased forecast for current period collections, up from an average of 95% in '21 to an average 98% over the course of '22.\nGreater contribution from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline, again, for those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K where we're providing our forecast of stabilized POI ramp up by year as well as accretion from our 2021 acquisitions being online for the full year. Additionally, of the $440 million of 2021 acquisitions, they are really outperforming our original underwriting and are expected to yield a blended 6% in 2022 versus an initial 5.5% expectation. Please note that these deals would clearly sell at a blended sub-5 cap rate in today's environment.\nNow this will be offset by lower prior period collections, where the net 2021 level is $22 million. And for '22, it is expected in the range of $5 million to $8 million. We are expecting lower net term fees. We had $8.4 million in 2021 and forecast $4 million to $6 million in '22, more in line with historical averages. Despite over 300 basis points of headwinds from prior period collections and lower net term fees, our comparable growth forecast is 3% to 5% for 2022.\nOther assumptions include $300 million to $400 million of redevelopment and expansions at our existing properties. $300 million to $400 million of equity to be issued inclusive of the forward equity already total. G&A is estimated in the $50 million to $54 million range for the year. We have set a credit reserve of roughly 2%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Dispositions made in 2021 contributed $8 million of PRI to 2021. And that obviously won't be there in 2022. And we will have lower interest income, given the repayment in mid-2021 of our $30 million mortgage loan at yield of 10%.\nAs is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2022. We will adjust for those as we go, given our opportunistic approach to both. It also does not assume any tenants moving from a cash basis to accrual basis. And please note the expanded disclosure in our 8-K relating to guidance.\nWith respect to our goal posts for 2023 and 2024, we continue to believe that 5% to 10% compounded growth from our upwardly revised 2022 FFO range is achievable. Timing in terms of the lease-up at One Santana West will have a big influence on where we end up within that range. Now while we are not providing color on specific timing, $7 per share of FFO is a realistic target in the coming years.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

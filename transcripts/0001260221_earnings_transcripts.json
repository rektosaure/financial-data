Welcome to the Q4 2025 TransDigm Group Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Lisman. Co-Chief Operating Officer, Joel Reiss; and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne. Also present for the call today is our Co-Chief Operating Officer, Patrick Murphy. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nBefore we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, and thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy; second, make a few comments about the quarter; and third, discuss our fiscal 2026 outlook. Then Joel and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in both good times and bad, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle.\nTo summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy.\nFirst, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value-creation methodology.\nOur long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we closed out the year with a good quarter. During the fourth quarter, we saw healthy growth in the revenue for our commercial aftermarket channel, robust growth in our defense market channel. And finally, as expected, our commercial OEM revenues returned to a growth position following the brief destocking trends we saw last quarter.\nFor the full year, our fiscal 2025 revenue and EBITDA as defined margin surpassed our most recently published guidance. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable. Air traffic continues to steadily progress and airline schedules remain fairly stable with takeoffs and landings growing in the 3% to 4% ballpark year-over-year.\nIn the commercial OEM market, there is still much progress to be made for OEM rates, and our results continue to be adversely affected by OEM performance. Airline demand for new aircraft remains high and the OEMs have long backlogs. OEMs are working to increase aircraft production to meet this demand, but the recovery to date has been bumpy and will likely remain so. Our EBITDA defined margin was 54.2% in the quarter. Contributing to this solid Q4 margin is the continued growth in our commercial aftermarket, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments.\nAdditionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q4 of over $500 million, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2.8 billion and over $2 billion pro forma for the Simmons acquisition. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout fiscal 2026.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. During our full fiscal '25 and continuing into October, we are pleased to have allocated approximately $7 billion of capital in the aggregate across M&A and return of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, these activities included the acquisitions of Servotronics, Simmons Precision Products and approaching $300 million of other small tuck-in acquisitions as well as a special dividend of $90 per share and $600 million of share repurchases.\nThe dividend of $90 per share was our largest to date. As you know, we are continuously assessing our capital allocation options and we were very pleased to return this capital to our shareholders. The recent share repurchases, including $100 million in October, are rooted in the same targeted returns math we have consistently applied over the years.\nRegarding the current M&A activities in the pipeline, we continue to actively look for opportunities that fit our model. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsized range. As always, we will remain disciplined around our approach to M&A. Additionally, acquisitions are, by their nature, hard to predict. So consistently with past practice, I will not be saying too much on what is currently active in our fall.\nThe capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses second, to accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via buybacks or dividends. The fourth option, paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and the capital markets are difficult to predict.\nWe exited fiscal 2025 with a sizable cash balance and our recent capital allocation actions still leave us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the really foreseeable future.\nNow moving on to our outlook for fiscal 2026. This guidance incorporates the recently acquired Simmons Precision Products business, which we are very excited to now own but which comes into the TransDigm fold at a profitability level below that of our typical acquisition. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures during the year.\nOur initial guidance for fiscal 2026 is it follows and can be found on Slide 7 in today's presentation. The midpoint of our fiscal '26 revenue guidance is $9.85 billion or up approximately 12% over the prior year. As a reminder and consistent with past years, with about 10% or so fewer working days than the subsequent quarters, fiscal '26 Q1 revenues, EBITDA and EBITDA margins are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of 2026. This revenue guidance is based on the following market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial OEM revenue growth in the high single digit to mid-teens percentage range which is highly dependent on the evolution of the production rates in the commercial OEM environment.\nCommercial aftermarket revenue growth is expected to be in the high single-digit percentage range. and defense revenue growth in the mid-single-digit to high single-digit percentage range. The midpoint of our fiscal 2026 EBITDA defined guidance is $5.15 billion or up approximately 8% with an expected margin of around 52.3%. This guidance includes an additional 200 basis points of margin dilution from recent acquisitions compared to fiscal '25.\nAdditionally, some commercial OE and defense mix headwind in the range of 0.5 percentage point to a full percentage point is further reducing our margins versus fiscal '25. Adjusting for these 2 dilutive factors, the margins would have increased more versus fiscal '25 and in line with the margin improvement we would typically expect on our base business. We anticipate EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year, with Q1 being the lowest and sequentially lower than Q4 of fiscal '25. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is expected to be $37.51. We believe we are well positioned as we enter our fiscal '26. We'll continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets develop and react accordingly.\nWe are pleased with the company's performance this year in 2025. Our team successfully navigated the challenges of uneven demand and our commercial OEM market throughout the year to deliver a healthy EBITDA defined margin. Looking to our new fiscal year, we remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. We look forward to fiscal '26 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you've come to expect from us.\nNow let me hand it over to Joel Reiss, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJoel B. Reiss\n\nCo-Chief Operating Officer\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of our results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2024. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion excludes the recent acquisition of Simmons Precision Products. In the commercial market, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket.\nOur total commercial OEM revenue increased 7% in Q4 and was down 1% for the full year fiscal 2025 and compared with the prior year periods. As we anticipated, commercial OEM revenue in the fourth quarter returned to positive growth as we supported higher build rates. However, overall, the commercial OEM revenue performance for the full year was softer than we originally expected for fiscal 2025. The year-over-year decline in commercial OEM revenue was primarily driven by the negative impact of OEM build rates that resulted from the Boeing strike and production ramp-up challenges at Airbus.\nBookings in the quarter were up compared to the same prior year period. Commercial transport bookings growth was up over 20% for the fourth quarter. The bookings levels for OEM commercial transport show that the market is recovering from the various disruptions seen over the past year or so. But as we have said before, this recovery could be a bit bumpy and uneven on a quarterly basis at the OEMs and our Tier 1 and Tier 2 customers rightsize inventory levels. We are encouraged by the progress of the 737 MAX production line as well as the FAA's approval for Boeing to increase its production rate. Our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production rates as they occur.\nTheir commercial OEM guidance we are giving today contains what we believe is an appropriate level of risk around the production build rates for the 2026 fiscal year. Our fiscal 2026 commercial OEM revenue guidance range of high single-digit to mid-teens percentage growth contemplates reasonable risks around the Boeing and Airbus rates.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 11% in Q4 and 10% for the full year compared with the prior year periods. Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues were up 5% in Q4. This quarter, all submarkets within the commercial aftermarket experienced positive growth. Our commercial aftermarket, excluding our bizjet submarket was up 13% driven by solid growth in freight, interiors and engines.\nBookings across all submarkets were up compared to the prior year period and POS at our distributors grew in double digits on a percentage basis this quarter. For the full year, the 10% revenue growth for commercial aftermarket was in line with our original expectations. Each of the submarkets performed about as expected with strong performance from our interior submarket and from the operating units with higher engine content within the passenger submarket. Our operating units continue to monitor market share and competitive losses and we see no material change in this space from either USM or PMAs.\nAs Mike already mentioned, we expect 2026 commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the high single-digit percentage range regarding how commercial aftermarket revenue is likely to progress throughout the fiscal 2026, Q1 is expected to be the lowest quarter of the year on a sales dollar basis as there are roughly 10% fewer working days than in other quarters.\nNow shifting to our defense market. Defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 16% in Q4 and 13% for full year fiscal 2025 compared with the prior year periods. We have seen strong growth in defense, driven by new business wins and strong performance by our teams in both domestic and international markets.\nQ4 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. Although we saw similar rates of growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total market with aftermarket running slightly ahead of Defense bookings for the quarter and full year significantly surpassed the comparable prior year periods and support our 2026 guidance for mid-single to high single-digit revenue growth.\nAdditionally, this quarter, we saw continued growth in the U.S. government defense spend out lease. As we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come to forecasting them with accuracy and precision, especially on a quarterly basis, be difficult. We anticipate capital expenditures of about $300 million in fiscal 2026. About 2/3 of our capital expenditure spending is our new business and productivity-driven projects.\nTypical payback for cost reduction projects is just a couple of years. We have over 150 new automation projects planned for the year. We continue to see the cost of automation technology decrease year-over-year. We are a high mix, low-volume manufacturer and our continued success taking on new automation tasks and assembly, machining, polishing and paying is exciting.\nAs a result of our continued focus on productivity in both the factory and offices, we anticipate our headcount will remain roughly flat despite the increase in commercial and defense OEM work content during the year. We also had good continued success winning new business this year. I can't get into specifics, but several operating units have been awarded content on the F-47, and we believe this will be an excellent platform for us, hopefully, in upcoming quarters, I'll be able to provide more specifics.\nTo highlight a few new business programs I can talk about. In September, the U.S. Army placed its first large production order for airborne systems glide modulation canopy marking a major milestone following nearly 2 years of successful test and evaluation. This product represents a significant technological advancement over the current generation system used by the U.S. Army and Air Force. This new product allows jumpers to more precisely target landings in confined areas. The initial order value at $5 million begins the full transition to the new Canopy in all future procurements. Airborne will deliver the first canopies in February 2026 to the U.S. Army Military free fall school where all new dopers will be trained on this new upgraded system.\nIn August, the U.K. Ministry of Defense awarded a $30 million contract to Urban DQ for an advanced aerial delivery system. This new system term private enables the RAP RAS Atlas A400 aircraft to air drop a rigid full boat up to 40 meters long and weighing up to 12 tons.\nIn addition, Oxytrol Weston reached an agreement with Rolls-Royce to supply its complete sensor suite on the Trent XWB-84 enhanced performance engine for the A350-900. This agreement encompasses OEM supply and power by our support to operators, ensuring that the proven reliability of our sensors continues to contribute to the success of all XWB engine variants.\nWe are making good progress integrating our 2 most recent acquisitions, Servotronics and Simmons Precision. Both integrations are being led by experienced EVPs. We have augmented the existing teams with seasoned individuals from other trains time operating units to accelerate their progress. It's still early, but our experience to date indicates that these are going to be 2 very good additions to TransDigm.\nLastly, I'd like to finish by recognizing the strong efforts and accomplishments of our operating unit teams during fiscal 2025. It was a good year, and we are pleased with the operating performance they delivered for our shareholders. As we enter our new fiscal year, our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and servicing the strong demand for our products.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah L. Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to review a few additional financial matters for fiscal 2025 and then also our expectations for fiscal '26. First, a few additional fiscal '25 data points on organic growth, taxes and liquidity.\nIn the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was approximately 11%, and all market channels contributed to this growth as previously discussed by Mike and Joel. On taxes, our GAAP and adjusted tax rates finished the year within a slightly better than their expected ranges.\nOn cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally defined as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $2.4 billion for the year, slightly above our expected estimate of $2.3 billion. Below that free cash flow line investment of net working capital consumed approximately $330 million on a full year basis. and the final net working capital ended the year roughly in line with historical levels as a percentage of sales.\nWe ended the year with approximately $2.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet or approximately $2 billion when pro forma for the completion of the Simmons acquisition. At year-end, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.8x, and up from the 5.9x at the end of last quarter after returning capital to our shareholders via a $90 per share dividend.\nWhile we don't target a specific amount of cash that we like to have on hand, we have sufficient capital available through both cash on hand and as well as incremental debt capacity to support all potential M&A in the pipeline. Over the course of fiscal '25, we did a fair bit of proactive financial. We pushed out our nearest term maturity in 2027 to 2028. Additionally, we reduced the interest rate on 2 of our loans. We also raised $5 billion to fund the aforementioned $90 dividend paid out in September.\nOur EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.2x and which provides us with comfortable cushion versus our target range of 2 to 3x. We continue to be comfortable operating in the 5% to 7% net debt/EBITDA ratio range a go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed, and we continue to seek the best opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy.\nOur capital allocation strategy is to both proactively and prudently manage our debt maturity stacks by keeping the nearest term maturity -- out. In addition, approximately 75% of our [ $32 million ] gross debt balance is fixed through fiscal 2029. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, swaps and collars.\nNext, on the fiscal 2016 expectations, I'm going to give some more details on the financial assumptions around interest expense, taxes and share count. A special note that all of my comments and data here in -- acquisition of Simmons. Net interest expense is expected to be about $1.9 billion in fiscal '26, and this equates to a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.3%. This estimate assumes an average over rate of 3.8% for the full year.\nOn taxes, our fiscal '26 GAAP cash and adjusted tax rates are all anticipated to be in the range of 22% to 24%. On the share count, we expect our weighted average shares outstanding to be 58.5 million shares in fiscal '26. With regards to the -- and leverage for fiscal '26 as we would traditionally define our free cash flow from operations at TransDigm, which again means EBITDA is defined less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, we estimate this metric to be close to $2.4 billion. After pay for the acquisition assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we would end the year with around $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet which would imply a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 5x at the end of fiscal '26. We will continue to watch this ratio along with the cash interest coverage ratio as we actively pursue options for maximizing value to our shareholders. through our capital allocation strategy.\nIn summary, we think we remain in good position with a incur flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via share buybacks and/or additional dividends during the course of fiscal '26.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Jaimie, our Director of Investor Relations.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nBefore we open the line for Q&A, I ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask 1 question only so we can get to as many people as possible, given that in our Q4 call and there's a lot of materials to cover today.\nOperator, can you please open the line."

Welcome to the Q3 2025 TransDigm Group Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker, Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations.

Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy. A few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '25 outlook. Then Mike and Sarah will give us some color on the quarter.\nBefore we get into the business of today, as I am nearing my retirement at September 30, I wanted to briefly reiterate what a privilege it has been to serve as CEO of TransDigm over these past 7-plus years. TransDigm is an exceptional company, and it has been incredibly rewarding to witness its growth and the value it has created for shareholders. Mike is ready to take the helm as TransDigm's CEO, and I'm confident that [indiscernible] will be in excellent hands under his leadership. Mike will do an outstanding job and continue delivering the kind of value that has long defined TransDigm's success. Additionally, I will remain adviser to TransDigm to aid in any transition topics.\nNow moving on to the business of today. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in both good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically, first, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology.\nThird, we have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit the strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our first earnings release, we had a decent Q3. During the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in the revenues for both our commercial aftermarket and defense market channels. Commercial OEM revenues were down this quarter compared to prior year, which Mike will discuss further in his market segment commentary. Suffice it to say, OEM revenue was a limiter for our quarterly performance, but this is only transitory and a lingering effect of the Boeing strike and continued rate ramp challenges at Airbus. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable. Air traffic continues to steadily progress and airline schedules remain fairly stable.\nIn the commercial OEM market, there is still much progress to be made for OEM rates, and our results continue to be adversely affected by OEM performance. Airline demand for new aircraft remains high and the OEMs have long backlogs. OEMs are working to increase aircraft production to meet this demand. However, Boeing aircraft production rates to continue to lag pre-pandemic levels and Airbus has also encountered difficulties in ramping up production. Our EBITDA as defined margin was 54.4% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong Q3 margin is the continued growth in our commercial aftermarket, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q3 of over $630 million, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of almost $2.8 billion. We expect to continue generating additional cash in our fiscal quarter -- in our final quarter of fiscal 2025.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal '25. As noted in our earnings release, we are decreasing our full fiscal year '25 sales guidance and increasing our EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our third quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. This guidance now incorporates the recently acquired Servotronics business. At the midpoint, sales guidance was lowered $60 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $40 million. The sales guidance reduction is driven primarily by lower commercial OEM build rates versus our expectations and inventory destocking, which Mike will further discuss later on. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for continued performance in our primary commercial end markets throughout the remainder of fiscal '25. Our current guidance for fiscal '25 is as follows and can be found also on Slide 6 in the presentation.\nNote that the pending acquisition of Simmonds business is excluded from this guidance until the acquisition closes. The midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is now $8.79 billion or up approximately 11% over prior year. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the commercial OEM market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of lower-than-expected third quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. For commercial OEM, we now expect revenue growth in the flat to low single-digit percentage range. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of low single-digit to mid-single-digit percentage range. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial aftermarket and defense as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed.\nCommercial aftermarket and defense revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range and defense revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. The midpoint of fiscal 2025 EBITDA as defined guidance is $4.725 billion or up approximately 13% with an expected margin of around 53.8%. This guidance includes about an additional 70 basis points of margin dilution from recent acquisitions compared to fiscal year '24. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is expected to be $36.74 or up approximately 8%. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal '25 financial assumptions and updates. We believe we are as well positioned for the last quarter of fiscal '25. We continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly.\nLastly, I want to express how pleased I am with our team's ability to successfully navigate the challenges of uneven demand in our commercial OEM market and deliver a healthy EBITDA as defined margin. We continue to stay focused on our core value drivers, maintaining an efficient cost structure and delivering operational excellence.\nNow let me hand it over to Mike Lisman, our TransDigm Group Co-COO and CEO-elect, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. First, I'll start with an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. In the past few months, we've signed up 2 M&A transactions, Servotronics and Simmonds. On July 1, we closed the acquisition of Servotronics for approximately $138 million in cash. Servotronics is a designer and manufacturer of servo valves for aerospace and defense applications. And then on June 30, we agreed to acquire the Simmonds Precision business from RTX Corporation for approximately $765 million in cash. Simmonds Precision is a designer and manufacturer of fuel and proximity sensing and structural health monitoring solutions for the aerospace and defense end markets. The business is expected to generate approximately $350 million in revenue for the 2025 calendar year. Both Servotronics and Simmonds Precision fit quite well with our existing portfolio of businesses.\nRegarding the current M&A activities in the pipeline, we continue to actively look for opportunities that fit our model. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsized range. We'll remain disciplined around our approach to M&A. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via buybacks or dividends. The fourth option, paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. As always, we continue to closely monitor the credit markets and we'll be assessing opportunities to utilize leverage for general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.\nNow moving on to our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2024 that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue was down 7% in Q3 compared with the prior year period. And on a sequential basis, total commercial OEM revenues were about flat compared to Q2. In comparison to what was expected 10 months ago at the start of our 2025 fiscal year, the commercial OEM revenue performance in our third quarter was significantly softer.\nWith regard to what is ultimately driving this performance, quite simply, the production rates at the OEMs are not as high as we'd expected. In the year-to-date period, rates have been negatively impacted by the strike at Boeing and production rate challenges at Airbus. This has reduced our commercial OEM shipments and hit our third quarter particularly hard as customers realign backlog and destocked.\nThe impact on shipments should be temporary. There are clear signs that the negative year-over-year commercial OEM revenue trends will turn positive in time, and this is evidenced in our commercial OEM bookings results for the third quarter. Whereas revenue declined, bookings in the quarter were up compared to the same prior year period. Specifically, commercial transport bookings growth approached the double digits on a percentage basis.\nDuring the quarter, there was some softness in our biz jet and helicopter submarkets, but this is primarily timing driven. The booking levels for OEM commercial transport show that the market is recovering from the various disruptions seen over the past year, but this recovery could be a bit bumpy and uneven on a quarterly sales basis as the OEMs rightsize inventory levels. With regard to the broader commercial OEM production environment, at this time, supply chains remain the primary bottleneck in the OEM production ramp-up. We remain encouraged by the recent progress on the 737 MAX production line, and our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production rates as they occur.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 6% compared with the prior year period. This quarter, all submarkets within commercial aftermarket continued to experience positive growth. The growth across the 4 submarkets was varied. Freight and interior were each stronger than the total commercial aftermarket 6% growth rate, whereas the passenger and biz jet submarkets performed slightly below the overall commercial aftermarket rate growth. Within our passenger segment, operating units with higher engine content posted very solid growth, well in excess of those with non-engine content and also considerably ahead of the 6% overall growth rate in our commercial aftermarket revenue. POS and our distributors grew in the double digits on a percentage basis this quarter.\nFor the full year, as you saw in today's guidance, our outlook for commercial aftermarket growth of high single-digit to low double-digit percentage growth is unchanged. A final comment pertaining to our longer-term commercial aftermarket performance over the last 4 years. As we look back at our historical aftermarket growth coming out of COVID, we rebounded more quickly than we had expected in the earlier part of the recovery and then saw things moderate a bit as the recovery completed in 2024 through to today. When we analyze this full time period, the last 4 years, that is, we sit today about where we should be on a volume basis given current global flight activity.\nNow shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 13% compared with the prior year period. Q3 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. Additionally, we saw similar rates of growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total defense market with OEM running slightly ahead of aftermarket. Defense bookings for the quarter were healthy compared to the prior year and continue to support our unchanged 2025 defense guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth.\nAdditionally, this quarter, we saw continued growth in U.S. government defense spend outlays, though the rate of growth has moderated a bit. As we've said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision, especially on a quarterly basis is difficult. Lastly, as always, our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and successfully closing out the 2025 fiscal year.\nNow a few quick organizational updates. I'm happy to announce that Patrick Murphy will become our next Co-COO. He has been with TransDigm for over 10 years and will make a great partner for Joel Reiss, who will be continuing as our other co-COO. Most recently, Patrick served as the TransDigm Executive Vice President for 6 years with direct oversight of several operating units. Additionally, he has overseen the integrations of our acquisitions of DART and the CPI businesses. Prior to becoming an EVP, Patrick was President of our HarcoSemco operating unit. He's a proven executive and a strong cultural fit. We're happy to have filled such an important position with an internally developed leader, and we continue to see our succession planning at work. I'm confident Patrick will continue running our operating units well and driving value creation across the organization.\nWith Patrick's promotion to Co-COO, we have promoted Dave Wilmot to an Executive Vice President role. Dave is an accomplished business leader. For the past 3 years, he served as the President of our AdelWiggins operating unit. As an EVP, Dave will be responsible for overseeing 6 of TransDigm's operating units. Both Patrick and Dave start in their new roles effective today. Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that Armani Vadiee has been promoted to General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of TransDigm. He has effectively been on the team for the last 15 years, both as our VP of Global Public Sector and before that, as outside counsel and partner at a DC law firm.\nFinally, and most importantly, as you know, this is Kevin's last earnings call. I have no doubt that he will miss these calls dearly in his retirement, and you can't see it, but he's actually tearing up here in Cleveland. I'm kidding that was a joke, but now speaking seriously, I want to take a moment to thank Kevin for his exceptional leadership as our CEO. It's been a privilege to work for and learn from him over the last 10-plus years here, and I know that our entire team shares this sentiment. Under Kevin's guidance, TransDigm has created significant shareholder value, and the team here has had a lot of fun in the process. We wish Kevin all the best in his well-earned retirement. Our transition is on track, and I look forward to stepping into the CEO role on October 1, and I'm excited to continue driving the private equity-like returns our shareholders have come to expect from TransDigm.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah L. Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the third quarter and then provide some more information on the current guidance. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the third quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.3%, driven by our commercial aftermarket and defense market channels, as Kevin and Mike have just discussed. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally defined as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was about [ $715 ] million for the quarter. coming in at about $1.9 billion on a year-to-date basis. For the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion in fiscal '25. Below that free cash flow line, an investment in net working capital consumed about $100 million for the quarter due to higher AR for our third quarter shipments and higher inventory planning for the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, we expect working capital to end roughly in line with historical levels as a percentage of sales. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.9x, down from 5.1x at the end of last quarter with approximately $800 million of the cash balance reserved for the anticipated closing of the Simmonds Precision acquisition. We are comfortable operating in the 5% to 7% net debt/EBITDA ratio range. And while we are currently sitting on the low end of this range, our go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed and we continue to seek opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy. Our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.3x which provides us with a comfortable cushion versus our target range of 2 to 3.\nDuring the quarter, we refinanced our earliest maturity debt instrument the approximately 2.7 billion senior subordinated notes to extend the maturity date from 2027 to 2033. This financing activity pushes out our nearest term maturity date of August 2028. And capital allocation strategy is always to both proactively and prudently manage our [indiscernible] stacks. We remain approximately 75% hedged on our total $25 billion gross debt balance through our fiscal 2027. And these are a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us plenty of protection at least in the immediate term.\nOn a go-forward basis, we expect to continue to both proactively and prudently manage our debt maturity stacks, which for us means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date. With regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our midpoint EBITDA while lowering sales reflecting the market segment changes discussed by Kevin and Mike. Adjusted EPS midpoint is now forecasted to be $36.74. We believe we remain in a good position from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or continue to return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Welcome to Q2 2025 TransDigm Group Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today. Jamie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Co-Chief Operating Officer, Mike Lisman; and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne. Also present for the call today is our Co-Chief Operating Officer, Joel Reiss. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nBefore we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov. The completion would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with a brief overview of our recent organizational announcement, then the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '25 outlook. Then Mike and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter.\nAs you may have seen, we announced this morning that I will retire at the end of TransDigm's 2025 fiscal year. Beyond that, I will continue to serve as an adviser to the company through March 31, 2026, to help facilitate the leadership transition. Additionally, I will continue to serve as a member of TransDigm's Board of Directors. It has been a privilege to lead TransDigm as CEO of these past 7 years. TransDigm is an exceptional company and I immensely enjoyed the opportunity to see it grow and generate value for its shareholders. I look forward to finishing out my last few months as CEO and continuing my involvement with TransDigm's Board member.\nI will be leaving TransDigm in very good hands as Mike Lisman has been elected by the Board of Directors to be our new CEO effective October 1, 2025. At that time, Mike will become responsible for all operational and financial matters. All our operating executives as well as the CFO will report to Mike. This succession planning has been in the works for some time, and we were very excited to promote an internally developed long-tenured employee into the position of CEO. Mike has served as TransDigm's Co-COO since May of 2023. Prior to that, he held several positions across the company, including that of CFO and Executive Vice President with direction -- with direct operational oversight for a number of our operating units.\nMike also previously held roles as the lead of TransDigm's M&A team and as a business unit manager at our Aero Fluid Products operating unit. Mike understands our unique culture and process and embraces our long-term value-generating strategy. He has contributed substantially to the value that TransDigm has created over his tenure. Mike is an excellent choice to lead TransDigm. I am confident he will do an outstanding job and continue to create the kind of value that has been the long-term hallmark of TransDigm.\nNow moving on to the business of today. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in both good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy specifically.\nFirst, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit the strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-term goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong Q2. During the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in the revenues for both our commercial aftermarket and defense market channels. Commercial OEM revenues this quarter were about flat with the prior year. Sequentially, both revenues and bookings improved in all 3 of our major market channels. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable. It's currently a very dynamic macroeconomic environment. But to this point, airline schedules continue to be fairly stable. In the commercial OEM market, there is still much progress to be made for OEM rates, and our results continue to be adversely affected by OEM performance.\nAirline demand for new aircraft remains high, and the OEM backlog remain considerable. OEMs are working to increase aircraft production to meet this demand. Boeing aircraft production rates are still well below pre-pandemic levels, the nearly 2-month long machine is strike last fall further delayed the recovery. However, there has been steady progress in Boeing's production rates, which is a positive sign. Our EBITDA as defined margin was 54% in the quarter, contributing to the strong Q2 margin is the continued strength in our commercial aftermarket, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of over $2.4 billion. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2025.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. During Q2, we opportunistically deployed just over $50 million of capital via open market repurchases of our common stock. This equates to approximately 40,000 of our shares at an average price of $1,250 per share. Additionally, after the quarter end, we deployed about $130 million of capital in early April to repurchase just over 100,000 of our shares at an average price of $1,241 per share. We view these purchases like any other capital investment and expect that they will meet or exceed our long-term return objectives. Regarding the current M&A activities and pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model.\nAs we look out over the immediate time horizon, we continue to see an expanding pipeline of potential M&A targets, and we do not see this environment slowing in the near term. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range, and TransDigm remains disciplined in our approach to M&A. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. The capital allocation priorities of TransDigm are unchanged.\nOur first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share purchases or dividends. The fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of over $2.4 billion. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal '25. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for continued performance in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal '25. Although we saw strong second quarter results, we are not changing our full year financial guidance for fiscal 2025 at this time. This may be conservative and the time will tell. The guidance incorporates the impact of recently enacted U.S. and non-U.S. tariffs. Based upon what we know today, we do not anticipate a material headwind from tariffs that we are unable to mitigate. As you know, TransDigm is largely a domestic manufacturer with limited exposure to low-cost country sources. The full year guidance assumes no significant macroeconomic impacts or other factors such as an economic recession that could affect our business. Additionally, we do not know what the indirect impact of tariffs could have on other parts of the aerospace supply chain, including OEM production rates.\nOur guidance can be found on Slide 6 in the presentation, and I will also discuss here. The midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is $8.85 billion or up approximately 11%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on for the commercial OEM market and defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions to reflect second quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of fiscal '25. For commercial OEM, we now expect revenue growth in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit percentage range. The previous commercial OEM revenue guidance was mid-single-digit percentage range.\nFor Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. The previous defense revenue guidance was high single-digit percentage range. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial aftermarket as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumption of revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range.\nThe midpoint of fiscal 2025 EBITDA as defined guidance is $4.685 billion, or up approximately 12%. And with an expected margin of around 52.9%. This guidance includes about an additional 70 basis points of margin dilution from recent acquisitions compared to fiscal '24. While we had a strong EBITDA margin result in the second quarter of fiscal year '25, margins can be lumpy and may fluctuate over the next couple of quarters. Again, this could be conservative. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is expected to be $36.47 or up approximately 7%. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly, the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal '25 financial assumptions and updates.\nAs the current environment is very dynamic, we will continue to evaluate our guidance and closely monitor our primary end markets as the year compresses. We believe we are as well positioned as we can be for the remainder of fiscal '25. As usual, we will continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. Let me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. We look forward to the second half of fiscal '25 and providing the value you have come to expect from us.\nNow let me hand it over to Mike Lisman, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nMike Lisman\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2024. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue was about flat in Q2 compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by about 17% compared to Q1. Bookings in the quarter were just slightly down compared to the same prior year period, with the softness driven by our biz jet and helicopter submarkets. The bookings levels for OEM commercial transport are roughly in line with our expectations prior to the Boeing strike with the growth rate in the low single digits for the quarter, giving us confidence that the commercial OEM market is recovering from the disruptions of approximately 2 quarters ago.\nOEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but continue to improve. Despite government actions regarding tariffs and concerns around a potentially weakening economic environment, Aircraft production backlogs are large enough that at this time, supply chains remain the primary bottleneck in the OEM production ramp-up. We remain encouraged by the progress of the 737 MAX production line. As in prior quarters, the commercial OEM guidance we're giving here today contains an appropriate level of risk around the MAX production build rate for the balance of the '25 fiscal year. We remain optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production rates as they occur.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Food and Commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 13% compared with the prior year period. This quarter, all submarkets within commercial aftermarket experienced positive growth. The growth across the 4 submarkets was varied but not significantly disconnected from what we had anticipated, bix jet freight and interior were each stronger than the total commercial aftermarket 13% growth rate, whereas the passenger submarket performed slightly below the overall commercial aftermarket rate growth.\nWithin our passenger segment, operating units with higher engine content posted very solid growth well in excess of those with nonengine content, and also considerably ahead of the 13% overall growth rate in our commercial aftermarket revenue. For the full year, and as you saw in today's guidance, our outlook for commercial aftermarket growth of high single digit to low double-digit growth is unchanged. We are watching the economic environment closely. Several airlines have announced potential capacity reductions for the '25 calendar year and in some instances, pulled our financial guidance.\nAt this time, despite these announcements and growing economic concerns, we are seeing no material weakness in our commercial aftermarket order book versus prior expectations. The bookings are coming in at about the pace we thought they'd be. So we are, therefore, not changing our guidance. Additionally, a few points of note. Q2 bookings in commercial aftermarket were strong, running ahead of our expectations, significantly outpacing sales and supporting the full year growth outlook. Additionally, our Q2 point-of-sales data through our distribution partners which can be a decent leading indicator was up significantly, well into the double digits on a percentage basis. As mentioned, we're monitoring our commercial aftermarket bookings rates closely and should these booking rates decline from what we are seeing at present as a result of economic softening and ensuing airline schedule reductions, we will revise our guidance accordingly on future earnings calls.\nNow turning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for March. Global revenue passenger miles have continued to surpass pre-pandemic levels since February of 2024. RPKs in March were up 3.3% versus prior year. The growth rate improved slightly versus what was seen in February. ASKs were up 5.3% and the passenger load factor for March came in at about 81%. I currently expect traffic to reach 113% of 2019 levels in 2025 and to surpass prior year traffic by 8%. Time will tell as the [indiscernible] forecast is too aggressive as a few other forecasters are predicting a growth rate a couple of points lower. Regardless of the exact growth rate, we remain ready to meet the demand.\nDomestic travel also continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels, the March posted marginal growth compared to the prior year and the most recently reported traffic data, global domestic air traffic was up about 1% compared to 2024 and up about 8% compared to 2019. Domestic air travel in March was unfavorably impacted by declines in both the U.S. and Australia. International traffic continues to trend upwards. It has been above 3 pandemic levels for the past several months. and the most recently reported data from March, international travel was up 4.9% compared to 2024 and about 3% above pre-pandemic loans. In March, most international markets saw growth though it was slower growth than prior months. North America and the Middle East were the only regions that saw slightly lower international traffic than prior year.\nNow shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 9% compared with the prior year period. Q2 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. Additionally, we saw similar rates of growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total defense market with OEM running slightly ahead of the aftermarket. Defense bookings for the quarter and year-to-date significantly outpaced sales and support the full year guidance for defense revenue growth. Additionally, this quarter, we saw continued growth in U.S. government defense spend outlooks. As we've said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come, forecasting them with accuracy and precision, especially on a quarterly basis is quite difficult. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are revising defense expectations upward and now expect revenue growth for this year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range.\nLastly, I'd like to wrap up by expressing how pleased I am by our operational performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Our operating unit teams did an exceptional job of executing on our value drivers, and this generated the strong results delivered in the second quarter. Our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and servicing the growing demand for our products as we continue through the balance of the year.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah L. Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the second quarter and then provide some more information on the current guidance. First, on organic growth of liquidity. In the second quarter, our organic growth rate was 7%, driven by our commercial aftermarket and defense market channels, as Kevin and Mike just discussed. On cash free cash flow, which we traditionally defined that EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was close to $340 million for the quarter. This is lower than our normal quarterly free cash flow conversion due to the timing of the interest and tax payments. We anticipated this dip. As you may recall, our fast order free cash flow came in higher at over $800 million.\nFor the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion in fiscal 2025. Below that free cash flow line, an investment in net working capital consumed about $190 million for the quarter due to the higher AR for our second quarter shipments and higher inventory plans in the back half of the year. For the full year, we expect working capital to end roughly in line with historical levels as a percentage of sales. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was [ 5.1 ], down from [ 5.3 ] at the end of the last quarter. While we don't target a specific amount of cash that we like to have on hand, we have sufficient capital available through both cash on hand as well as incremental debt capacity to support all potential M&A activity in the pipeline.\nAs a reminder, we are comfortable operating in the 5 to 7x net debt-EBITDA ratio range. And while we're currently sitting on the low end of this range, our go-forward strategy, capital deployment has not changed. Our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4x, which provides us with comfortable cushion versus our target range of [ 2 to 3 ]. Regarding our debt, our nearest term maturity is over 2 years out due November 2027 and we remain approximately 75% hedged on our total $25 billion gross debt balance through fiscal 2027. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us plenty of protection, at least in the immediate term.\nAs Kevin mentioned, during the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 40,000 shares along with an additional 100,000 shares during the first week of April during the depressed stock price. This totals $500 million in deployed capital for repurchases on a year-to-date basis when combined with the first quarter repurchases. We continue to seek the best opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy. On a go-forward basis, we expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our debt maturity stacks which for us means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date. Regards to the guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we have maintained our prior financial guidance for fiscal 2025.\nA quick note on the evolving tariff environment. As Kevin mentioned, TransDigm is largely a domestic manufacturer with limited exposure to low-cost country sourcing, from an operations perspective, our 51 operating unit teams are driving their own actions to alleviate the majority of any negative headwinds through a combination of measures, including but not limited to, U.S. MCA exemptions, cost reduction initiatives and supply chain resourcing to name a few. Each operating unit developed a course of action in this regard that is specific to its own circumstances and situation. We believe we remain in a good position from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A will continue to return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

The commercial aftermarket has returned to normalization as global air traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels and robust demand for travel persists. In the commercial OEM market, there is still much progress to be made for OEM rates and our results continue to be adversely affected by OEM performance. Airline demand for new aircraft remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, Boeing aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels as the lingering effects of last fall's nearly 2 month-long machine of strike and its ongoing impact to the supply chain continue to be felt. The strike has pushed the OEM recovery further to the right and time will tell how this plays out. Our EBITDA, as defined margin, was 52.9% in the quarter. Contributing to this strong Q1 margin is the continued strength in our commercial aftermarket along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments.\nAdditionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of over $750 million and ended the quarter with almost $2.5 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2025.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. During Q1, we opportunistically deployed just over $300 million of capital via open market repurchases of our common stock. This equates to approximately 250,000 of our shares at an average price of $1,249 per share. We view these repurchases like any other capital investment and expect this will meet or exceed our long-term return of [indiscernible].\nRegarding the current M&A activities and pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the immediate time horizon, we continue to see an expanding pipeline of potential M&A targets, and we do not see this environment slowing in the near term. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range, but larger deals may also be actual. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. The fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of almost $2.5 billion. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal '25. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for continued performance in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal '25. Although we saw strong first quarter results, we are not changing our full year revenue and EBITDA as defined guidance for fiscal 2025 at this time. We are also maintaining our previously issued full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed for any of these markets. Additionally, uncertainty remains around the commercial OEM production rate progression and supply chain impact as Boeing recovers from the machine strike. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and respond as needed with commercial OEM production ramp up certainty and only 1 quarter of data, it's too close to call on making changes to our primary end market guidance at this time.\nOur guidance can be found on Slide 6 in the presentation, and I will reiterate it here. The midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is $8.85 billion or up approximately 11%. The revenue guidance is based on the following market channel growth rate assumptions. Commercial OEM revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range, which is highly dependent on the evolution of the production rates in the commercial OEM environment. Commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range and defense revenue growth in the high single-digit percentage range. The midpoint of fiscal 2025 EBITDA is defined guidance is $4.685 billion, or up approximately 12% with an expected margin of around 52.9%. This guidance includes about an additional 70 basis points of margin dilution from recent acquisitions compared to fiscal '24. While we had a strong EBITDA margin result in the first quarter of '25, margins can be lumpy and may fluctuate over the next few quarters. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is increasing versus our prior guide to reflect the lower outstanding share count resulting from the share repurchases discussed earlier. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is now expected to be $36.47 or up approximately 7%. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly, the factors impacting EPS, along with some other fiscal '25 financial assumptions and updates. We believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal '25. As usual, we will continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly.\nLet me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. We look forward to the remainder of fiscal '25 and providing the value you come to expect from us.\nNow let me hand it over to Joel Reiss, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJoel B. Reiss\n\nCo-Chief Operating Officer\n\nGood morning.\nI'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2024. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion includes the 2024 acquisitions in both periods.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue decreased approximately 4% in Q1 compared with the prior year period. Commercial transport OEM, this is largely Boeing and Airbus was down 1%. [indiscernible] and helicopter OEM revenue was down 8%. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues contracted by 17% in Q1. Bookings in the quarter were solid, up both sequentially and against prior year Q1.\nOur commercial OEM business was impacted in the quarter by the Boeing machine of strike, which affected at 737 MAX, 767 and 777 production lines. In total, the strike and subsequent production restart lasted roughly 12 weeks, specific to TransDigm since we shipped direct as well as through sub-tiers on the affected platforms. The impact across our businesses is uneven and varied. Boeing's receiving docks were closed during the strike, while some sub-tiers continue to drive consistent demand. This will likely cause further commercial OEM impact into the balance of the year. It is too soon to determine how much of an impact the strike will have what is a fragile supply chain recovery, precisely predicting the ramp-up and the flow through to the supply chain is tough. However, the commercial OEM guidance we are reiterating today contains what we believe is an appropriate level of risk around the 737 MAX, 767 and 777 production build rates for the 2025 fiscal year.\nAs we noted on our last earnings call, shortly after the strike began, we proactively initiated cost reduction initiatives across our operating units to rightsize our structure to account for the lower 2025 OEM production environment. These cost reduction initiatives span furloughs, headcount reduction, hiring freezes, acceleration of productivity projects and a range of other actions aimed at reducing expenses. These initiatives enabled us to beat our Q1 and active productivity target and put us in a good position for the year. In addition, as is typical for us, we will add resources judiciously as we see the higher ramp rate materialize. The business jet helicopter [indiscernible] in quarter 1 versus prior year is primarily timing related, but we were also impacted by the 4-week Textron strike. Bookings were up nicely in Q1 over the same period last year, which should set us up for growth in the balance of the year.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 9% compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by about 4% compared to Q4 '24. Commercial aftermarket bookings were solid compared to prior year. Bookings and shipments are running in line with our expectations, and continue to support our unchanged 2025 commercial aftermarket guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth. As a reminder, and as we've said many times before, the commercial aftermarket can be lumpy and when forecasting our commercial aftermarket, we always focus on 12-month trends, not quarterly trends. Our commercial aftermarket is made up of 4 submarkets, passenger, interior, freight and business jet. This quarter, the growth across the 4 submarkets was vary, but not significantly disconnected from what we had anticipated. All 4 submarkets revenue increased versus Q1 of last year. Business Jet was stronger and freight weaker than the total commercial aftermarket 9% growth rate. The passenger submarket performed in line with the overall commercial aftermarket rate of growth. Within our passenger segment, operating units with higher engine content posted very solid growth well in excess of those with non-engine content. Additionally, quarter 1 point of sales data from our distribution partners increased well into double digits first quarter 1 of last year. These factors give us confidence we will achieve the commercial aftermarket growth rate guidance for fiscal 2025.\nTurning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for December. Global revenue passenger miles have continued to surpass pre-pandemic levels since February of 2024. 2024 air traffic increased 10.4% above 2023 and is about 3.8% above prepaid debit [indiscernible]. RPKs in December were up 8.6% versus prior year. While ASKs were up 5.6% as passenger load factor is a near record highs of 84%, driving the additional upside. IATA currently expects traffic to reach 113% of 2019 levels in 2025 and to surpass prior year traffic by 8%. Domestic travel also continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In the most recently reported traffic data, global domestic air traffic was up 5.7% compared to 2023 and 9.7% compared to 2019. Domestic air travel growth has been driven significantly by outsized growth in China, where air travel was up 20.2% compared to 2019. International traffic continues to trend upwards and has been above pre-pandemic levels for the past few months in the most recently reported data for 2024, international travel was about 0.5% above 2019 levels.\nMost international markets saw stable growth with Asia Pacific, the major driver of the increase. Shifting to our defense market, which is traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 11% compared with the prior year period. Q1 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. We saw similar growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total defense market, with the aftermarket running slightly ahead of OEM.\nDefense bookings for the quarter were healthy compared to the prior year and continue to support our unchanged 2025 defense guidance of high single-digit revenue growth. However, as you know, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy and forecasting them with precision on a quarterly basis is difficult. Similar to my commercial aftermarket commentary, the defense growth rates could also be uneven over the individual quarters of 2025.\nIn addition, we continue to see steady improvements in on-time delivery and other key customer performance metrics, which are now approaching 2019 levels with improving supply chain performance, we are on track to surpass those levels later this year. We also saw good new business awards and bookings in the quarter in both commercial and defense markets. Corey Electronics was selected by a major OEM as the provider of a flight deck control panel systems for a new derivative platform. As the incumbent on other platforms with this customer, Corey was well positioned to be responsive to their time line, providing the right technology, customization and capability required in an exceptionally short period of time. In addition to Corey Electronics, we had solid awards during the quarter at Airborne Systems North America, Armtec, Cellspan and [indiscernible] within the quarter. During the quarter, we saw our succession planning at work with 1 executive EVP retirement and 2 EVP promotions. Pete Palmer, after an impressive 25-year career with TransDigm has retired. Pete began as a product line manager of [indiscernible] Wiggins and evolved into a key leader within our organization. His contribution span multiple areas, including mergers and acquisitions, serving as President of several business units, playing a pivotal role in the Esterline integration and spearheading our TransDigm University leadership development program in partnership with the University of Southern California. We extend our heartfelt thanks to Pete for his dedication and wish him a well-deserved relaxing retirement. With Pete's retirement and the acquisitions made in 2024, we promoted 2 accomplished leaders to Executive Vice President roles. Jason Marlink, who joined us has accumulated 17 years of experience across several TransDigm operating units. His most recent role was as President of Champion Aerospace and Liberty, South Carolina. Jason was promoted in October, and now we'll oversee 6 operating units. Similarly, Chris Blackford, who has served with TransDigm for 11 years was promoted in November. Chris has held leadership roles across multiple units, including his most recent position as President of Airborne Systems North America. Like Jason, Chris will be responsible for over 6 operating units. We are confident that both Jason and Chris will continue driving operational excellence and value creation across the organization.\nLastly, I'd like to wrap up by expressing how pleased I am by our operational performance in the first quarter. There was a very good start to our fiscal 2025. As we progress further into fiscal '25, our management teams remain focused on our consistent operating strategy and servicing the strong demand for our products.\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah L. Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone.\nI'll recap the financial highlights for the first quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the first quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.6%, driven by our commercial aftermarket and defense market channels, as Kevin and Joel have just discussed. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally defined as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was over $800 million for the quarter. This is higher than our average free cash flow conversion due to the timing of our interest and tax payments. This will normalize throughout the year as our interest and tax payments will pick up next quarter. For the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion in fiscal '25. Below the free cash flow line, net working capital usage was neutral for the quarter. For the full year, we expect working capital to end roughly in line with historical levels as a percentage of sales. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 million of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.3x, up from 4.5x at the end of last quarter after paying out the $75 dividend earlier in Q1. While we don't target a specific amount of cash that we like to have on hand, we have sufficient capital available through both cash on hand as well as incremental debt capacity to support all potential M&A activity in the pipeline. As a reminder, we are comfortable operating in the 5% to 7% net debt-EBITDA ratio range. And while we are currently sitting on the low end of this range, our go-forward strategy, capital deployment has not changed. Our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4x, which provides us comfortable cushion versus our target of 2 to 3x.\nRegarding our debt, our nearest term maturity is 2027, and we remain approximately 75% hedged on a total $25 billion gross debt balance through our fiscal 2027. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps swaps and collars. This provides us plenty of protection at least in the medium term. As Kevin mentioned, during the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 250,000 shares, deploying just over $300 million of cash. We continue to seek the best opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy. On a go-forward basis, we expect to continue to both proactively and prudently manage our debt maturity steps, which for us is pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date. With regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we maintained our prior guidance for sales and EBITDA. Our adjusted EPS guidance is up slightly, now at $36.47 compared to the prior guidance of $36.32. The increase is due to the approximately 250,000 shares we repurchased during the quarter. As we sit here today, from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 TransDigm Group Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI will hand the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Jaimie Stemen.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Co-Chief Operating Officer, Joel Reiss; and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne. Also present for the call today is our Co-Chief Operating Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nBefore we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy. A few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. Then Joel and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter.\nTo reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in both good times and bad, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.\nAbout 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins, and over any extended period, have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically.\nFirst, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit the strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology.\nOur long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong quarter. Our Q3 results ran ahead and we once more raised our guidance for the year. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization. Robust demand for travel persists and global air traffic continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. Airline demand for new aircraft also remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still much progress to be made for OEM rates and our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic production.\nIn our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all three of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Revenues also sequentially improved in all three of these market shares. Our EBITDA as defined margin of 53.3% in the quarter. Contributing to this strong Q3 margin is the continued strength in our commercial aftermarket, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q3 of over $600 million and ended the quarter with almost $3.4 billion of cash. We expect to continue generating additional cash in our final quarter of fiscal 2024.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. This has been a busy and exciting quarter for M&A. During the quarter, we completed the acquisitions of SCI Industries and the Electron Device business of communications and power industries. Subsequent to the quarter closed on July 31, we closed the acquisition of [ Raptor Scientific ]. Further details of each individual acquisition can be found in the previously published press releases on TransDigm's website.\nIn the aggregate for these 3 acquisitions, we have deployed over $2.2 billion of capital in the past 3 months. The unique product and service offerings of each acquisition exhibit the earnings stability and growth potential that are consistent with our existing portfolio of businesses. These three acquisitions fit well with our long-standing strategy, and we expect each of these businesses to meet or exceed our long-term return objectives. We expect these three acquisitions in total to contribute about $125 million to our fiscal year '24 revenue and a combined margin approaching 30%.\nRegarding the current M&A activities and pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the time horizon, we continue to see an expanding pipeline of potential M&A targets. As we demonstrated this year, we do not see this environment slowing in the near term. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range, I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nThe capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses. Second, do accretive disciplined M&A and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic.\nAs mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of almost $3.4 billion. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal 2024. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full year '24 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong third quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year, as well as to include the recent acquisitions of [ SEI ] Industries, the [ CPI ] Electron Device business and [ Raptor Scientific ]. Please note that each of these acquisitions closed recently, our preliminary expectation for each business will be refined as necessary over the coming months.\nAt the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $160 million, and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $85 million. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for continued performance in our primary commercial end markets throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024. Our current guidance for fiscal '24 is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation.\nThe midpoint of our fiscal '24 revenue guidance is now $7.9 billion or approximately 20%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong third quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year.\nFor Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the high teens percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of mid-teens percentage range. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial OEM revenue growth of around 20% and commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range.\nThe midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $4.13 billion or up approximately 22%, with an expected margin of 52.3%. This guidance includes slightly under 125 basis points of margin dilution from recent acquisitions. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $33.02, or up approximately 28% over prior year. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS, along with some other fiscal '24 financial assumptions and updates.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the last quarter of fiscal '24. We continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop, and we will react accordingly.\nLet me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence.\nNow let me hand it over to Joel Reiss, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJoel B. Reiss\n\nCo-Chief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2023. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 23% in Q3 compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by about 7% compared to Q2. Bookings in the quarter were healthy compared to the same prior year period, and these booking levels continue to support the commercial OEM guidance for revenue growth of around 20% for fiscal '24.\nOEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be improving. As many of you know, concerns have arisen over the past few months around the expected 737 MAX production rate ramp. Time will tell how this plays out. As we shift to both [ Boeing ] as well as their sub tiers, the impact across our businesses is somewhat varied. In general, we are seeing monthly bill rates as low as [ 20 ] and as high as [ 42 ] for parts with extended lead times. Overall, we would estimate an average build rate at the end of Q3 of about 25 aircraft per month.\nThe commercial OEM guidance we are giving today contains an appropriate level of risk around the MAX production build rate for the balance of our fiscal year. We do expect the OEM challenges will have an impact on how quickly they ramp up to their target rates. While we are not yet providing guidance for 2025, we do expect their production rate ramp-up will be slower than we had previously expected.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 11% compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by about 5% compared to Q2. As a reminder, our commercial aftermarket is made up of 4 submarkets: passenger, interior, freight and business jet. I would like to provide a bit more color than is historically typical on our commercial aftermarket submarkets.\nGrowth in our passenger submarket, which is our largest was up about 16% versus the prior year period. This submarket continues to perform exceptionally well. Year-to-date, as of our June quarter end Passenger submarket revenues were up 21% over the comparable prior year period. This compares favorably to the latest IATA passenger traffic data, which shows a year-over-year growth in June of 9.1%.\nFor fiscal Q3, our interior submarket increased roughly 8% when compared to the prior year period. This is primarily driven by repair sales as interior refurbishments have not yet returned to 2019 levels.\nFor fiscal Q3, our business jet submarket increased roughly 10% when compared to the prior year period and reverses the lower number we saw in Q2, highlighting the lumpiness of our commercial aftermarket in any one period. Business Jet does remain a watch item due to the temporary business jet flight activity. These increases were partially offset by declines in our freight submarket, which was down roughly 8%. The freight decline was primarily a result of the continued return of [ belly ] capacity consistent with what we have discussed on our past few earnings calls. On a sequential basis, freight was up 7%.\nFor the full year, and as you saw in today's guidance, our outlook for commercial aftermarket growth in the mid-teens is unchanged. We saw a number of elements in our Q3 results that make us confident here. Mainly Q3 bookings [ to ] commercial aftermarket were strong, running in line with our expectations and outpacing sales and supporting the full year growth outlook. Additionally, our Q3 point of sales data through our distribution partners was up roughly 25% from the same period last year.\nFinally, a reminder, commercial aftermarket can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, both revenue and bookings. We do expect that as passenger traffic has returned to pre-pandemic levels, the commercial aftermarket rate of growth will continue to moderate. Note that our guide for mid-teens growth across our total commercial aftermarket still incorporates a continued drag from both cargo and the business jet submarkets for the balance of the year.\nTurning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for [indiscernible]. Global revenue passenger miles have continued to surpass pre-pandemic levels since February 2024. June 2024 air traffic was up 3% of the 2019 levels. IATA currently expects traffic to reach 104% of 2019 levels this year and to surpass prior year traffic by 12%.\nDomestic travel also continues to surpass 2019 levels. In the most recently reported traffic data for June, global domestic air traffic was up 10% compared to prepandemic levels, domestic air travel growth has been driven significantly by outsized growth in China, which was up 22% in June compared to 2019.\nShifting over to the U.S. domestic travel for June was up about 6% from 2019 air traffic levels.\nInternational traffic has generally hovered slightly above or below pre-pandemic levels for the past few months. In the most recently reported data for June, inter casual travel was just slightly below prepandemic levels. This is a significant improvement from the 88% of 2019 levels 1 year ago.\nIn summary, for the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see strong growth in our passenger and interior submarkets indicative of the continuing positive trends in passenger trends. We expect our freight [indiscernible] market to remain light in year-over-year comparisons based on current trends in the underlying market. Business jet remains a watch item and may continue to bounce around.\nShifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 13%, compared with prior year period, and is up 20% year-to-date versus the prior year period. Q3 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. Additionally, we saw similar rates of growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total defense market with aftermarket running slightly ahead of OEM.\nDefense bookings in the quarter were also strong compared to the same prior year period, supporting the revised defense revenue guidance for the full year. Additionally, we saw growth in the U.S. government defense spending outlays during Q3. We are hopeful we will continue to see steady growth here. But as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. Forecasting them with accuracy and precision on a quarterly basis is difficult.\nAs Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the high teens percent range. This updated guidance for defense primarily reflects the stronger-than-expected Q3 defense sales as well as the good Q3 bookings.\nNext, I will provide a quick update on our recent acquisitions of SEI and the CPI Electron Device business. The SEI and CPI Electron Device business acquisition integrations are both progressing well under the leadership of one of our experienced Executive Vice President, Patrick Murphy. We have owned SEI and the CPI Electron Device businesses for a little over 2 months, and we are pleased with each acquisition thus far.\nSEI has been bolted on to one of our existing operating units, [ dark aerospace ]. We have split the CPI Electron Device business into two operating units. Microwave power products located to [ Palo Alto ] and Woodland, California and CPI of Electron Device business located in Beverly, Massachusetts and Middlesex U.K. Although very early in our ownership of these businesses, we are pleased by what we are seeing in the businesses.\nIn closing, I'd like to express how pleased I am by our operational performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and servicing the robust demand for our products as we continue through the remainder of the year.\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah L. Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the third quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance update.\nFirst, on organic growth and liquidity. In the third quarter, our organic growth rate was 14.6% and all market channels contributed to this growth, as Kevin and Joel just discussed.\nOn cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally defined as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $700 million for the quarter, coming in around $1.6 billion on a year-to-date basis. For the full fiscal year, we now expect to generate free cash flow slightly above $2 billion.\nBelow that free cash flow line, net working capital consumed $84 million, and we continue to expect our annual dollars invested in net working capital to roughly align with historical levels as a percentage of sales. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.7x, similar to last quarter, which was at 4.6x, as we paid approximately $1.5 billion for acquisitions in Q3, primarily for the CPI acquisition that we closed on June 6.\nIn addition, we closed on the Raptor acquisition after the quarter on July 31 and deployed $655 million for that acquisition. Pro forma for the Raptor acquisition, the Q3 quarter end cash balance would have been approximately $2.7 billion. While we don't target a specific amount of cash that we'd like to have on hand, we are happy to have cash available to support M&A, especially given the timing of closing of some of these can be difficult to predict.\nWe continue to be comfortable operating in the 5 to 7x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio range. And while we are currently sitting slightly below the low end of this range, our go-forward strategy, capital deployment has not changed. And we continue to seek the best opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy.\nOur EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.5x, which provides us with comfortable cushion right against that target range of 2 to 3x. We continue to closely monitor our debt stacks and repriced approximately $3.6 billion of our term loan debt to a more favorable rate [ SOFR plus 2.5 ] our capital allocation strategy always to both proactively and prudently manage their debt maturities [indiscernible].\nOur nearest term maturity is November 27, which gives us plenty of protection, at least in the short test. In addition, approximately 75% of our $22 billion gross debt balance is fixed through fiscal 2027. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps swaps and collars. This continues to provide us adequate cushion against any rising rates, at least in the immediate term.\nWith regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our midpoint sales and EBITDA by $160 million and $85 million, respectively. Given the strong quarter along with our current expectations for the year, including the newly closed acquisitions. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $33.02 compared to the prior guidance of $32.42 in support of the higher EBITDA.\nAs we sit here today, from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to continue pursuing M&A opportunities or return cash to our shareholders by dividend or repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Welcome to TransDigm Group Inc. Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Co-Chief Operating Officer, Mike Lisman; and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne. Also present for the call today is our Co-Chief Operating Officer, Joel Reiss.\nPlease visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information. Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. Then Mike and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in both good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. .\nTo summarize here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology.\nThird, we have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value-creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market.\nTo do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong quarter. Our Q2 results ran ahead of our expectations, and we once again raised our guidance for the year. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization. Global air traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels and demand for travel remains robust.\nAirline demand for new aircraft also remains high, and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still much progress to be made for OEM rates and our results to continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic production levels. In our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Revenues and bookings also sequentially improved in all 3 of these market channels.\nOur EBITDA as defined margin of 53.2% in the quarter, contributing to the strong Q2 margin is the continued strength in our commercial aftermarket along with diligent focus on our operating strategy, which is allowing margin performance to expand across all segments. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q2 of close to $230 million and ended the quarter with almost $4.3 billion of cash.\nWe expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2024. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. Regarding the current M&A activities and pipeline, we continue to expect of fiscal year '24 closure of the Electron Device business of Communications and Power Industries, also known as CPI, which was announced on a prior earnings call. We continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to see an expanding pipeline of potential M&A targets.\nThis remains a busy time, and we are actively expanding our M&A team to address these opportunities. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range, I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. Please see our 10-Q for more detail on some smaller, but nicely accretive acquisitions that we recently closed.\nThe capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, do accretive discipline to M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. Before the option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict.\nAs always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of almost $4.3 billion, which includes the $2 billion of cash from new debt issued during our first quarter of fiscal '24. That debt was proactively raised for the acquisition of CPI's electron device business and general corporate purposes. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal '24. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '24 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. At the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $75 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $60 million. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for continued performance in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal '24.\nOur current guidance for fiscal 2024 is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. Note that the pending acquisition of CPI's Electronic Device business is excluded from this guidance until acquisition closed. The midpoint of our fiscal '24 revenue guidance is now $7.74 billion or up approximately 18%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on -- for the defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong second quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year.\nFor Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions.\nWe expect commercial OEM revenue growth around 20% and commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range. The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $4.045 billion or up approximately 19% with an expected margin of around 52.3%. This guidance includes about 100 basis points of margin dilution from our recent [indiscernible] acquisition. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $32.42 or up approximately 25% over prior year. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly, the factors impacting EPS, along with some other fiscal '24 financial assumptions and updates.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the second half of fiscal '24. We'll continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. Let me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. Let me hand it over to Mike Lisman, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2023. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. .\nOur total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 21% in Q2 compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by about 12% compared to Q1. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. These booking levels continue to support the commercial OEM guidance for revenue growth of around 20% for fiscal '24. OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be progressing. Broadly speaking, we continue to be encouraged by the elevated and healthy airline demand for new aircraft.\nSupply chains remain the primary bottleneck in this OEM production ramp-up. As many of you know, concerns have recently arisen around the expected 737 MAX production rate ramp. Time will tell how this plays out. At this time, we remain cautious and are watching for a potential realignment of our current MAX order backlog to reflect the lower production rates.\nThe commercial OEM guidance we are giving today contains an appropriate level of risk around the MAX production build rate for the balance of our '24 fiscal year. While both the 737 MAX risks as well as other risks remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader aerospace sector, we're optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production rates as they occur.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 8% compared with the prior year period. I would like to provide a bit more color than is typical on our commercial aftermarket submarkets as the variation in growth rates seen this quarter across those submarkets was much larger than usual.\nThe 8% growth rate mentioned was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is by far our largest submarket. Growth in our passenger submarket was roughly 20% versus the prior year period, and this submarket continues to perform exceptionally well. We also saw good growth in our interior submarket of about this same rate when compared to prior year Q2. These increases were offset by declines in our freight and bid jet submarkets. Freight was down roughly 15% and bid jet was down in the 5% area.\nThe freight decline was primarily a result of the continued return of belly capacity, consistent with what we discussed on our past few earnings calls. The biz jet decline is a result of tempering biz jet flight activity, which has continued to come down from the pandemic cost.\nFor the full year, and as you saw in today's guidance, our outlook for commercial aftermarket growth in the mid-teens is unchanged. We saw a number of elements in our Q2 results that make us confident. Mainly bookings in commercial aftermarket were strong, running ahead of our expectations, significantly outpacing sales and supporting the full year growth outlook.\nAdditionally, our Q2 point of sales data through our distribution partners, which can be a decent leading indicator was up significantly, well into the double digits on a percentage basis. Finally, a reminder commercial aftermarket can be [indiscernible] on a quarterly basis, both revenue and the bookings, not as lumpy as defense aftermarket, but lumpy nonetheless.\nFinally, note that our guide for mid-teens percentage growth across our total commercial aftermarket, [indiscernible] today still incorporates a continued drag from the cargo and biz jet submarkets for the balance of this fiscal year.\nNow turning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for March. Global revenue passenger miles surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time in February 2024 and continue to do so in March. March '24 air traffic was about 1% above prepandemic and IATA currently expects traffic to reach 104% of 2019 levels in 2024.\nDomestic travel continues to surpass prepandemic levels. In the most recently reported traffic data for March, global domestic air traffic was up 6% compared to prepandemic. Domestic air travel growth has been driven significantly by outsized growth in China, which was up 14% in March compared to prepandemic. This is a significant improvement from China being down 3% a year ago in March of 2023.\nShifting over to the U.S. domestic market, domestic air travel for March was about 4% above prepandemic traffic. International traffic has continued to make steady improvement over the past few months. We slightly surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time in February. In the most recently reported data for March, international travel was down just 2% compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and this marks a significant improvement from being down about 18% 1 year ago.\nIn summary, for the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see growth in our passenger and interior submarkets indicative of the continuing positive trends in the post COVID passenger traffic recovery. Our biz jet and freight submarkets are as we'd expect in light of the current trends in their underlying markets.\nNow shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 21% compared with the prior year period. Q2 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses and customer base. Additionally, we saw similar rates of growth in both the OEM and aftermarket components of our total defense market with aftermarket running slightly ahead of the OEM.\nWe do not expect to see defense revenue growth rates as this 20%-plus level continuing for the balance of the year. and we expect some moderation or temporary here, as you can tell from the guidance given today. Defense bookings were up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and support the revised defense revenue growth guidance for the full year. Additionally, this quarter, we saw growth in U.S. government defense spend outlays, and we're hopeful we'll continue to see steady growth here -- but as we have said many times before, the bed sales and bookings can be lumpy.\nWe know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision, especially on a quarterly basis is difficult. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the mid-teens percentage range. This updated guidance for defense primarily reflects stronger-than-expected Q2 defense sales as well as the good Q2 bookings.\nLastly, I'd like to wrap up by expressing how pleased I am by our operational performance in the second quarter of fiscal '24. Even though we saw some lumpiness in our most profitable end market -- commercial aftermarkets, our operating unit teams did an exceptional job of executing on our value drivers that generate strong results delivered this quarter. Our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and servicing the robust demand for our products as we continue through the balance of the year. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah L. Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the second quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance update. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the second quarter, our organic growth rate was 16.1%, and all market channels contributed to this growth as Mike, Kevin has just discussed.\nOn cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally defined as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $290 million for the quarter, coming in around $950 million on a year-to-date basis. As a reminder, our fiscal Q1 free cash flow was higher than average due to the timing of our interest and tax payments.\nFor the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $2 billion in fiscal 2024. Below that free cash flow line, net working capital consumed $82 million, driven by AR with the higher sales in the quarter and inventory as we support the second half of our year. We continue to expect our annual dollars invested in net working capital to moderate from the elevated levels we've seen over the prior 2 years, but pinpointing an exact dollar amount of investment for fiscal '24 is difficult.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.6x, down from 5x at the end of last quarter. As a reminder, approximately $1.4 billion of this cash is reserved for the anticipated closing of the CPI acquisition. We continue to be comfortable operating in the 5 to 7 net debt-EBITDA ratio range and while we are currently sitting slightly below the low end of this range, our go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed, and we continue to see the best opportunities for providing value to our shareholders through our leverage strategy.\nOur EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4x on a pro forma basis, which provides us with a comfortable cushion versus our target range of 2 to 3x. During the quarter, we completed a few financing objectives, including pushing out our nearer-term debt stack along with repricing approximately $6 billion of our term loan debt from [indiscernible] plus [indiscernible] to [indiscernible] quarters. This financing activity effectively pushes out our nearest term maturity date by 2 fiscal years for fiscal 2028. Our capital allocation strategy is always to both proactively and prudently manage our debt maturity stack and these actions accomplish that.\nThe financing activities slightly reduced our interest expense for fiscal '24, reducing expense by $12 million or $25 million on an annualized basis. However, as you'll note, our guidance for the interest expense has decreased by $60 million, primarily driven by the interest income we received year-to-date and project for 2024. We remain approximately 75% hedged on our total $22 billion gross net bonds throughout fiscal '26. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and colors.\nThis continues to provide us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term. With regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our midpoint sales and EBITDA by $75 million and $60 million, respectively, given the strong quarter and current expectations for the year, along with increasing our EBITDA margin guidance from 52% to 52.3%. Our adjusted EPS guidance is now $32.42 compared to the prior guidance of $30.85. As we sit here today from an overall cash, liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility through M&A or return cash to shareholders via dividends or share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us on the call today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. Then Joel and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter.\nTo reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.\nAbout 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically, first, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology.\nOur long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong quarter. Our Q1 results ran ahead of our expectations, and we have raised our sales and EBITDA as defined guidance for the year. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization.\nGlobal air traffic is closing in on prepandemic levels and demand for travel remains high. Airline demand for new aircraft also remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, total air travel demand remains slightly below pre-COVID levels and OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still progress to be made for the industry, and our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Our EBITDA as defined margin was 51% in the quarter contributing to the strong Q1 margin and the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of over $630 million and ended the quarter with over $4.1 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2024.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we agreed on November 9 to acquire the Electron Device Business of Communications & Power Industries, also known as CPI, for approximately $1.385 billion in cash. CPI's Electron Device Business is a leading global manufacturer of electronic components and subsystems, primarily serving the aerospace and defense market. The products manufactured by this business are highly engineered proprietary components with significant aftermarket content and a strong presence across major aerospace and defense platforms.\nOur team is working diligently through the approval process in the U.S. and U.K., and the acquisition is expected to close this fiscal year. We remain very excited about adding this proprietary business as one of our TransDigm operating units.\nRegarding the current M&A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to see a target-rich environment for our focused acquisition strategy. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nThe capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. The fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic.\nAs mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of over $4.1 billion, which includes the $2 billion of cash from the new debt issued during our first quarter. Sarah will comment on this in more detail later. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal '24. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '24 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. At the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $85 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $45 million. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for a continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal year '24.\nOur current guidance for fiscal '24 is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. Note that the pending acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business is excluded from this guidance until acquisition closed. The midpoint of our fiscal '24 revenue guidance is now $7.665 billion or up approximately 16%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. For Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of mid- to high single-digit percentage range.\nWe are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial OEM revenue growth around 20% and commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range.\nThe midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.985 billion or up approximately 17% with an expected margin of around 52%. This guidance includes about 100 basis points of margin dilution and from our recent Calspan acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margins will move up throughout the remainder of the year. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is decreasing versus our prior guide primarily due to the higher interest expense associated with the incremental debt we took on to fund CPI. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is now expected to be $30.85 or up approximately 19% over prior year. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal '24 financial assumptions and updates.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal '24. We'll likely continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly.\nLet me conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence.\nNow let me hand it over to Joel Reiss, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJoel Reiss\n\nCo-Chief Operating Officer\n\nGood morning. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2023, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 25% in Q1 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. Our strong bookings continue to support the commercial OEM guidance of revenue growth around 20% for fiscal '24. OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be progressing. We continue to be encouraged by the steadily increasing commercial OEM production rates and strong airline demand for new aircraft. Supply chains remain the primary bottleneck in this OEM production ramp-up.\nThe FAA's recently announced production rate freeze at 38 per month for the Boeing 737 MAX will likely slow the expected MAX ramp and time will tell how this plays out. The commercial OEM guidance given today takes into account an appropriate level of continued risk around Boeing's production build rate. While risks such as this and others remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader aerospace sector, we are optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production targets as they occur.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 22% compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is by far our largest submarket. We also saw good growth in our interior submarket compared to prior year Q1 and biz jet was up slightly year-over-year as well. These increases were very minimally offset by a very slight decline in our freight submarket driven by the return of belly capacity and consistent with what we discussed on last quarter's earnings call.\nCommercial aftermarket bookings for this quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. The strong booking levels in commercial aftermarket continue to support our commercial aftermarket guide for revenue growth in the mid-teens percent range for fiscal '24. As a reminder, when forecasting our commercial aftermarket, we always look at a rolling historical 12-month average booking trend, never just the most recent quarter, due to lumpiness that we often see in this end market.\nTurning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for December. Global revenue passenger miles still remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, but only slightly. December 2023 air traffic was about 2.5% below pre-pandemic and full 2023 traffic was about 6% below. Globally, a return to 2019 air traffic levels is expected in 2024 and IATA currently expects traffic to reach 104% of 2019 levels in 2024. Domestic travel continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In the most recently reported traffic data for December, global domestic air traffic was up 2% compared to pre-pandemic. Domestic air travel in China also continues to improve and was up 8% in December compared to pre-pandemic levels. This is a significant improvement from China being down 55% a year ago in December 2022.\nShifting over to the U.S., domestic air travel for December came in about flat with pre-pandemic traffic. International traffic has continued to make steady improvement over the past few months. A quarter ago, at the end of September, international travel globally was depressed about 7% compared to pre-pandemic levels, but in the most recently reported data for December, international travel was only down about 5%. This is a significant improvement over being down 25% a year ago in December 2022.\nIn summary, for the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see strong growth in our passenger and interior submarkets, indicative of the continuing positive trends in the post-COVID passenger traffic recovery. Our biz jet and freight submarkets are performing in line with their underlying markets and also in line with our expectations at this point in the year.\nShifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 28% compared with the prior year period. Q1 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses. However, bear in mind that the comparable prior year period was an easy comp. We would not expect to see defense revenue growth rates at this level continuing throughout the balance of the year. We expect some moderation here as you can tell from the guidance.\nDefense bookings are also up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period. While the defense revenue growth this quarter was pretty broadly distributed across our customer base, we continue to see improvements in the U.S. government defense spending outlays during Q1. We are hopeful we will continue to see steady improvement. But as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision is difficult. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range.\nThis updated guidance for defense primarily reflects the stronger-than-expected Q1 defense sales as well as the good Q1 bookings. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the fiscal 2024 fiscal year and I was pleased with our operational performance. We will remain focused on our consistent operating strategy and servicing the strong demand for our products as we continue throughout the balance of the year.\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the first quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance update.\nFirst, on organic growth and liquidity. In the first quarter, our organic growth rate was 23.5%, and all market channels contributed to this growth as Kevin and Joel have just discussed. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, was roughly $660 million for the quarter. This is a higher than average free cash flow conversion for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of our interest and tax payments. Cash interest and tax payments will pick up again in the next quarter and for the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged. We expect to continue to generate free cash flow of close to $2 billion in fiscal '24.\nBelow that free cash flow line, net working capital consumed a smaller amount of cash than in prior years coming in close to flat. For the past few years, we saw a large influx of cash into our working capital as our primary commercial end markets experienced strong rebound post COVID. We were obviously very happy to support this increase. Going forward, we expect our annual dollars invested in net working capital to moderate from the elevated levels seen over the prior 2 years, but pinpointing the exact amount of investments for fiscal '24 is difficult. As you know, the rebound of the OEM market channel does impact our accounts receivable as customers in that bucket typically have slightly longer payment terms.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5x, down from 5.4 at the end of last quarter when pro forma was $35 dividend. As a reminder, we are comfortable operating in the 5 to 7 net debt-EBITDA ratio range. And while we are currently sitting on the low end of this range, a go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed. Our EBITDA to [indiscernible] expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.3x on a pro forma basis, which provides us with comfortable cushion versus our target range of 2 to 3x.\nDuring the first quarter, we went to the market and proactively raised $2 billion of debt, the acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business, which is still subject to regulatory approval with the rest going towards general corporate purposes. As a result of the additional debt, our interest expense estimate for fiscal '24 increased by $130 million, as you can see in today's updated interest expense guidance. Regarding that debt, we expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our maturity deck stack, which for us means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date. Out near term debt maturity is now 2026, and we remain appropriately 75% hedged on a total $22 billion gross debt balance through our fiscal 2026. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us adequate cushion against derives in rates at least in the immediate term.\nWith regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our midpoint sales and EBITDA by $85 million or $45 million, respectively, given the strong quarter and current expectations for the year. Our EPS guidance is now $30.85 compared to prior guidance of $31.97. The reduction is due to additional interest expense. Without that, it would be $32.57. As we sit here today from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Welcome to the TransDigm Group Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Again, please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Co-Chief Operating Officer, Mike Lisman; and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne. Also present for the call today is our Co-Chief Operating Officer, Joel Reiss. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nBefore we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy. A few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. Then Mike and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter.\nAs we previously announced on October 27, we had 2 directors retired from the TransDigm Board, Merv and John Merv has served on our Board since 2009 and John since 2012. We sincerely appreciate both Merv and John's dedication to TransDigm over the years. They each have done an outstanding job as directors and truly contributed to the long-term value creation of TransDigm. Considering these 2 director retirements, our Board is now comprised of 10 directors. For the near term, we feel our board size of 10 is appropriate and composed of highly qualified leaders with the appropriate skill sets to oversee and guide TransDigm. However, as we always do, we will continue to regularly assess the Board composition into the future.\nNow moving on to the business of today. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize here are some of the reasons why we believe this. Our 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins, and over any extended period, have typically provided relative stability in the downturns.\nWe follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value-creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our earnings release, we closed out the year with another good quarter. We had solid operating performance in Q4 with both total revenue and EBITDA as defined margin coming in strong. For the full year fiscal '23 revenue came in at the high end of our most recently published guidance and our fiscal '23 EBITDA as defined margin surpassed that guidance.\nCommercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization. Global air traffic is still moving forward and demand for travel remains high. OEMs are making steady headway on aircraft production. However, total air travel remains slightly below pre-COVID levels and OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still progress to be made for the industry and our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Revenues also sequentially improved in all 3 of these market channels.\nOur EBITDA as defined margin was 52% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues along with our strict operational focus and disciplined approach to cost structure management. Additionally, we had good operating cash flow generation in Q4 of over $460 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.5 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash through 2024.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. As was mentioned in our press release, we've decided to pay a special dividend of $35 per share. The dividend will be paid on November 27. Sarah will address this more later. In aggregate, including Calspan acquisition completed this past May, and this dividend to be paid in late November, we have allocated over $2.7 billion of capital to our -- in the interest of our shareholders in under 7 months.\nAlso, we disclosed in our press release earlier today, we agreed to acquire the Electron Device business of communications and power industries, also known as CPI, for approximately [ $1.385 ] billion in cash. CPI's Electron Device business is a leading global manufacturer of electronic components and subsystems primarily serving the aerospace and defense market. The products manufactured by this business are highly engineered proprietary components with significant aftermarket content and a strong presence across major aerospace and defense platforms.\nCPI's electron device business generated approximately $300 million in revenue for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The acquisition is currently expected to close by the end of the third quarter of our fiscal '24.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are exiting fiscal '23 with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.5 billion. Pro forma for the dividend, our fiscal year end cash balance is over $1.4 billion and growing. As always, we continue to closely monitor the credit markets and we'll be assessing opportunities to utilize leverage for the acquisition of CPI's electron devices business and general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions, share repurchases under our stock repurchase program and dividends.\nRegarding the current M&A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to have a slightly stronger than typical pipeline of potential targets and remain encouraged concerning deal flow. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nAs we move into our new fiscal year, the capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buyback or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we still do take this into consideration.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal 2024. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for a continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets through fiscal '24. Throughout fiscal '23, we were encouraged by the recovery seen in our commercial revenues and strong trends. Our strong bookings support the fiscal '24 commercial end market revenue guidance, which I will comment on shortly. Trends are positive across all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We are cautiously optimistic that the prevailing conditions will continue to evolve favorably. We will watch this closely as we always do. And will react as necessary, including taking any preemptive steps that might be warranted. Changes in market condition and the impact to our primary end markets could lead to revisions in our guidance for 2024.\nOur initial guidance for the fiscal 2024 continuing operations is as follows and can also be found on Slide 7 in the presentation. The pending acquisition of CPI's Electron Device business is excluded from this guidance. The midpoint of our fiscal '24 revenue guidance of $7.58 billion or up approximately 15%. As a reminder and consistent with past years, with roughly 10% less working days than the subsequent quarters, fiscal 2024 Q1 revenues, EBITDA and EBITDA margins are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of '24. This revenue guidance is based on the following market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial OEM revenue growth around 20%. Commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range and defense revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range.\nThe midpoint of fiscal 2024 EBITDA as defined guidance is $3.94 billion or up approximately 16% with an expected margin of around 52%. This guidance includes about 100 basis points of margin dilution from our recent Calspan acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margin will move up throughout the year, with Q1 being the lowest and sequentially lower than Q4 of fiscal 2023.\nThe midpoint of adjusted EPS is anticipated to be $31.97 or up approximately 24%. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal '24 final assumptions and updates. We believe we are well positioned as we enter fiscal '24. As usual, we will continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly.\nLet me conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the company's performance this year and throughout the recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. We look forward to fiscal 2024 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us.\nNow let me hand it over to Mike Lisman, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nMike Lisman\n\nGood morning. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2022, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into the OEM and aftermarket.\nOur total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 22% in Q4 and 24% for full fiscal year '23 compared with the prior year periods. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by about 4% compared to Q3. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. This strong bookings throughout fiscal '23 supports the commercial OEM guidance for revenue growth of around 20% for fiscal '24.\nOEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be slowly progressing. We continue to be encouraged by the steadily increasing commercial OEM production rates at Boeing and Airbus and the strong airline demand for new aircraft. Supply chains remain in the bottleneck in its OEM production ramp-up. While risks remain towards achieving this ramp-up across the broader aerospace sector, we are optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production targets.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 27% in Q4 and 31% for the full fiscal year '23 compared with the prior year periods. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is by far our largest submarket. We also saw growth in our interior and biz jet submarkets compared to prior year Q4. These increases were minimally offset by a slight decline in our freight submarket.\nThe post-COVID return to flying globally continues and is buoyed our primary commercial aftermarket submarkets, passenger, biz jet and interior, while the now sustained global softness in declines in global freight volumes, seen over the past year plus likely contributed to the minor decline in the freight submarket that we saw this quarter.\nSequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues increased by approximately 2%. Commercial aftermarket bookings for this quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. And in the full 2023 fiscal year, these commercial aftermarket bookings exceeded sales nicely. The strong bookings levels in commercial aftermarket over the past 12 months support our commercial aftermarket guide for revenue growth in the mid-teen percent range for fiscal '24.\nAs a reminder, when forecasting our commercial aftermarket, we always look at rolling historical 12-month average booking trends, never just the most recent quarter, due to some lumpiness that we can often see and have historically seen in this end market. This lumpiness is not quite as big as what we can see in the defense end market, but it is there nonetheless.\nTurning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for September. Global revenue passenger miles still remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, but growth in air traffic over the past few months has continued to signal steady recovery momentum. Globally, a return to 2019 air traffic levels is still expected in 2024.\nDomestic travel continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. And the most recently reported traffic data for September, global domestic air traffic was up 5% compared to pre-pandemic. Domestic air travel in China continues to improve and was up 8% in September compared to pre-pandemic. This is a significant improvement from China being down 55% only 9 months ago in December. We did not expect such a steep ramp-up in China activity this past year, and it was a nice surprise.\nShifting over to the U.S. domestic air travel for September came in 6% above pre-pandemic traffic.\nInternational traffic has continued to make strides over the past few months. A quarter ago, at the end of June, international travel globally was depressed about 12% compared to pre-pandemic levels, but in the most recent data for September, this travel was only down about 7%.\nNow some quick color on our commercial aftermarket submarkets, starting with the biz jet submarket. Business jet utilization is below the pandemic highs reached in 2021 and continues to temper. Overall, global business jet activity does remain above pre-pandemic levels by about 10% to 15% and time will tell how this normalizes over the upcoming months. Within our biz jet submarket, our revenue was well above pre-COVID.\nNext, on the cargo submarket. As a reminder, this is one of our smaller submarkets within the commercial aftermarket bucket. Global air cargo volumes have continued to struggle and after 19 straight months of year-over-year declines, just returned to flattish to slightly positive growth these last 2 months. Cargo Tekalometers, CTKs have been below pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, full freighter aircraft are being used less now and have seen an increase in park rates due to the return of belly cargo capacity on the passenger side. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we've started to see some booking softness in the freight submarket of our commercial aftermarket, likely as a result of the sustained declines in CTKs and the full freighter market challenges that I referenced.\nOne quick aside to summarize what is currently going on in our commercial aftermarket submarkets and how we, as a management team, think about. If you take a step back and look at how things have trended from pre-COVID to the present over the past 4 years. At COVID's onset, we saw a precipitous drop at first in the passenger submarket, followed shortly thereafter by a big run-up in freight to levels in excess of pre-COVID activity. After a few years of seeing these trends, these markets are now in various stages of returning back to their original trend lines.\nPassenger traffic continues to surge back and with it, belly cargo, while full freighter cargo aircraft traffic is dropping back to trend. We are happy to see this dynamic. Passenger is by far our largest submarket within the commercial aftermarket and we win on this trade-off between full freighters and passenger.\nShifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 15% in Q4 and 11% for the full fiscal year '23 compared with the prior year periods. This full year defense revenue growth exceeded our last guidance expectation of growth in the mid- to high single-digit range that we gave on the last call. Sequentially, total defense revenues grew by approximately 9%.\nDefense bookings are also up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period. We continue to see improvements in the U.S. government defense spend outlays which is reflected in our defense revenue and bookings performance this quarter. We are hopeful we'll continue to see steady improvement. But as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision is difficult.\nLastly, I'd like to finish by recognizing the strong efforts and accomplishments of our 49 op unit teams during fiscal '23. It was a good year, and we're pleased with the operating performance they delivered for our shareholders. As we enter our new fiscal year, our management teams remain committed to our consistent operating strategy and servicing the now very strong demand for our products.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sarah Wynne.\n\nSarah Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to review a few additional financial matters for fiscal '23 and then also our expectations for fiscal '24. First, a few additional fiscal '23 data points on organic growth, taxes and liquidity. In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 18.5%, driven by the continued rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets.\nOn taxes, our GAAP and adjusted tax rate finished the year within their expected ranges. Our fiscal '23 GAAP rate was 24% and the adjusted rate was just under 25%. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally defined as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $1.8 billion for the year, higher than the $1.4 billion we had originally expected, driven primarily by the good operating performance that Kevin and Mike mentioned, and the extra EBITDA we generated above our original guidance carries over to cash flow.\nAs Kevin mentioned, we ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet or over $1.4 billion when pro forma for the $35 dividend. At year-end, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.8x, down from the 5.3x at the end of last quarter. Pro forma for the $35 per share dividend announced this morning, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 5.4x. The dividend payment date is expected to be November 27.\nWe continue to watch the rising interest rate environment closely. We remain 80% hedged on our total $20 billion gross debt balance through a combination of interest rate caps, swaps and collars through 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rising rates, at least in the immediate term. Our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio, which, as a reminder, becomes more important in a higher interest rate environment and is a metric we actively monitor and take into consideration in these times of elevated interest rates ended the year at 3.1x on a pro forma basis, which sits comfortably in line with our pre-COVID average range of 2 to 3x. We continue to be comfortable operating the business within these brackets.\nWith regard to any potential changes to our long-term approach to using debt to boost our equity returns, we're actively watching the interest rate environment closely, but do not anticipate any big changes in our approach at this time.\nNext, on the fiscal '24 expectations, I'm going to give some more details on the financial assumptions around interest expense, taxes and share count. Special note that all of my comments and data here include the payment of the $35 dividend, but exclude the acquisition of CPI's Electron Device business entirely, which is still subject to regulator approval, and we expect to close by the end of our third quarter in fiscal '24.\nNet interest expense is expected to be about $1.25 billion in fiscal '24. And this equates to a weighted average cash interest rate of approximately 6.3%. This estimate assumes an average over rate of 5.4% for the full year.\nOn taxes, our fiscal '24 GAAP cash and adjusted tax rates are all anticipated to be in the range of 22% to 24%. The slight decrease in our tax rate versus the prior year is due mainly to the additional interest expense we're able to deduct for tax purposes, given our higher expected EBIT for '24. For share count, we expect our weighted average shares outstanding to be 57.8 million shares in '24.\nWith regard to liquidity and leverage for fiscal '24, as we would traditionally define our free cash flow from operations at TransDigm, which again, is EBITDA as defined less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, we estimate this metric to be close to $2 billion in fiscal '24. With regard to the dividend, the $35 per share payment announced this morning represents a gross payout of just over $2 billion. The record date for the special dividend is November 20, and the payout date is expected to be November 27.\nAfter paying out the $35 per share dividend in cash and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we would end the year with over $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which would imply a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio close to 4x at the end of fiscal '24. However, this excludes the acquisition of CPI's Electron Device business which is still subject to regulator approval, and we expect to close by the end of our third quarter in fiscal '24.\nAs Kevin mentioned at the outset, we are actively monitoring the capital markets and assessing opportunities to utilize leverage for this acquisition and general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions, share repurchases or dividends. And as a reminder, there has been no change in our approach to how we think about capital allocation or leverage with our typical target in the 5% to 7% net debt ratio range.\nWe will continue to watch this ratio along with the cash interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest expense as we actively pursue options of maximizing value to our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy. So a final note on that, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via share buybacks and/or additional dividends during the course of fiscal '24.\nwith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '23 outlook. Then Joel and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter.\nAs we previously announced on May 26, we made 3 significant organizational changes this quarter. Jorge Valladares will retire at the end of TransDigm's 2023 fiscal year. Jorge has served as TransDigm's COO for the past 4 years. His prior roles include co-COO, Executive Vice President and President of 3 TransDigm operating units.\nJorge will aid in the transition of his role to the new co-COOs, Mike Lisman and Joel Reese, until his retirement date. Jorge also joined TransDigm Board of Directors as of May 26. Jorge has been with the company more than 25 years and has been an integral part of the long-term value creation at TransDigm and a key player in the cultural preservation of the company. Jorge has done a truly outstanding job and we sincerely thank him for his dedication. We are happy to have Jorge continue contributing to the growth of TransDigm as a member of the company's Board.\nMike Lisman and Joel Reese have assumed the roles of Co-COOs. Mike served as TransDigm's CFO for the past 5 years prior to becoming CFO, he worked at our Aero Fluid Products operating unit and on the M&A team at TransDigm.\nJoel is a long-term -- longtime employee of TransDigm, having joined the company in 2000. He was an Executive Vice President for the last 8 years. Prior to that, Joel served as President at 2 different TransDigm operating units, Hartwell and Aerospace. Before becoming a President, Joel was the Director of Operations at our Adams Wright operating unit.\nSarah Wynne has assumed the role of CFO after having served as TransDigm's Chief Accounting Officer for the past 5 years. Sarah has been with the company for 20 years. And before becoming TransDigm's Chief Accounting Officer, she was a group controller overseeing the financial reporting of several operating units. Prior to that, Sarah was a controller at our ArroFluid Products operating unit and held various accounting positions in the TransDigm corporate office.\nMike, Joel and Sarah bring a unique mix of experience in a broad range of aerospace businesses to their new roles. They are all experienced TransDigm executives with proven track records. We are very excited to promote internally-developed long-tenured employees to each of these roles to perpetuate TransDigm's unique culture. I'm confident that they will continue to create the kind of value that has been the long-term hallmark of TransDigm.\nNow moving on to the business of today. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle.\nTo summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period, have typically provided relative stability in the downturns.\nWe follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically: first, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content; second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology; third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders; fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns; and lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology.\n[indiscernible] our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our earnings release, we had a solid quarter. Our Q3 total revenue was strong, and we had a robust EBITDA as defined margin for the quarter. Additionally, we once again raised our guidance for the year. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and trends are still favorable as demand for travel remains high. Global domestic air traffic continues to lead the recovery and has surpassed pre-pandemic levels.\nInternational travel is also making progress in catching up to domestic trial. However, total air travel demand remains slightly below pre-COVID levels. There is still progress to be made for the industry and our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. In our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Revenues also sequentially improved in all 3 of these market channels.\nEBITDA as defined margin improved to 52.5% in the quarter, contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had good operating cash flow generation in Q3 of over $400 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.1 billion of cash. We expect to continue generating additional cash in our final quarter of fiscal 2023.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsized [indiscernible] comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged.\nOur first priority is to reinvest in our business; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration.\nWe are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict. We continue to maintain significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Sarah will provide further commentary on our capital allocation during her prepared remarks.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal '23. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '23 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong third quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year.\nAt the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $100 million, and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $105 million. The guidance assumes the continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets throughout the remainder of fiscal '23, and no additional acquisitions or divestitures.\nOur current year guidance is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is now $6.555 billion, or up approximately 21% versus fiscal '22. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the commercial aftermarket and defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong third quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWe now expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth for fiscal '23 to be in the low 30% range, which is an increase from our previous guidance range of 25% to 30%. The commercial aftermarket has been progressing well in our fiscal '23, and we plan for that to continue through Q4 and beyond. However, we aim to be conservative with this guidance as the commercial aftermarket is harder to predict with many orders being booked and shipped and the advanced bookings only going out a few months or so into the future.\nFor Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of low to mid-single-digit percentage range. Commercial OEM revenue guidance is still based on our previously-issued market channel growth rate assumptions. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate for commercial OEM as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. We continue to expect commercial OEM revenue growth in the 20% to 25% range.\nThe midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.365 billion or up approximately 27%, with an expected margin of around 51.3%. This guidance includes about 50 basis points of margin dilution from the DART Aerospace acquisition and about 50 basis points of margin dilution from the recent Calspan acquisition. The pro forma margin dilution from Calspan, meaning if we had owned Calspan for all of our fiscal year '23, is just over 100 basis points.\nThe midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA as defined guidance and now anticipated to be $25.15 or up approximately 47%. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly some other fiscal '23 financial assumptions and updates.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the last quarter of our fiscal '23. We will continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. Let me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout this recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence.\nNow let me hand it over to Joel to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the balance of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2022. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The May 2023 acquisition of Calspan Corporation is excluded from this market discussion.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 25% in Q3 compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by about 4% compared to Q2.\nBookings in the quarter were robust compared to the same prior year period and significantly outpaced sales. We are encouraged by the increasing commercial OEM production rates and airline demand for new aircraft. OEM supply chain and labor challenges still persist but appear to be making steady progress. While risks remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader aerospace sector, we are cautiously optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production targets.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 32% in Q3 when compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket.\nAlthough all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q3. Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues increased by approximately 2%. Commercial aftermarket bookings for this quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period.\nTurning to broader market dynamics. Global revenue passenger miles still remain lower than pre-pandemic levels but growth in air traffic over the past few months has continued to signal steady recovery momentum. IATA recently commented, they see a better demand outlook for 2023 air travel than they previously forecast and now expect total 2023 revenue passenger miles to reach 88% of 2019 levels. IATA also expects a return to 2019 air traffic levels in 2024.\nThe recovery in domestic travel further progressed over the past few months and has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for June global domestic air traffic was up 5% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Domestic air travel in China continues to improve and was up 15% in June compared to pre-pandemic levels. This is a significant improvement from China being down 55% only 6 months ago in December. U.S. domestic air travel for June came in just slightly above pre-pandemic traffic but year-to-date surpasses pre-pandemic levels by about 2%.\nInternational traffic has made strides over the past few months and is catching up to the domestic recovery. A quarter ago, at the end of March, internationally travel globally was depressed about 18% compared to pre-pandemic levels, but in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for June international travel was only down about 12%. International traffic in North America is 2% above pre-pandemic levels and Europe is within 10%. Asia Pacific international travel was still down about 29%, which should hopefully continue to improve as the China reopening progresses.\nGlobal air cargo volumes in the most recent June IATA data continued to be lower year-over-year and compared to pre-pandemic levels, but the contraction versus these prior year periods has moderated a bit. Going forward, improvements in inflation in major economies could potentially provide a tailwind to air cargo demand. However, with the continued growth in passenger buying, especially the widebody recovery, there is more belly hold space available for cargo transport. It's too early to determine where our air cargo trend stabilize but we will continue to watch this closely.\nBusiness jet utilization is below the pre-pandemic highs in 2021 and continues to temper Business jet activity does remain above pre-pandemic levels, but time will tell how this normalizes over the upcoming months.\nShifting to our defense market which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 17% in Q3 and when compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total revenues grew by approximately 14%. Defense bookings are also up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period.\nThis quarter, we began to see improvements in the U.S. government defense spend outlays, which is reflected in our defense revenue performance this quarter. We are hopeful we will continue to see steady improvement. But as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy.\nAs Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range. Next, I will provide a quick update on our recent acquisition of Calspan Corporation. As discussed on our last earnings call, we completed the Calspan acquisition this past May, for $725 million in cash.\nCalspan has established positions across a diverse range of aftermarket focused aerospace and defense, development and testing services including a state-of-the-art transonic wind tunnel that it utilizes to perform testing for both the commercial and defense end markets. Calspan's unique service offerings exhibit the earnings stability and growth potential that are consistent with our aerospace component center businesses. The Calspan acquisition integration is progressing well under the leadership of Executive Vice President, Paula Wheeler. We have now owned Calspan for 3 months, and we are pleased with the acquisition thus far.\nBefore concluding, I'd like to review 1 additional executive change that occurred during Q3. We recently promoted Kevin McCary to the Executive Vice President role. Kevin has worked for TransDigm for over 20 years, and was most recently the President of our Kirkhill Operating Unit for 5 years. Prior to that, Kevin was the Director of Sales at our Hartwell, Airborne Systems and our Adams Wright Aerospace operating units and also served as President of Adams right Aerospace. We continually work to improve our bench strength of promotable talent, and we are happy to have Kevin as our newest Executive Vice President. This promotion gives us the resources we need to oversee our business units following my promotion to co-COO.\nLastly, I'd like to wrap up by stating how pleased I am by our operational performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We remain focused on our value drivers and meeting increased customer demand for our products.\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sara Wynne.\n\nSarah Louise Wynne\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide an overview on a few financial matters for the quarter and expectations for the full fiscal year. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the third quarter, our organic growth rate was 20.7%, driven by the continued rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets.\nOn cash free cash flow, which we traditionally define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $540 million for the quarter. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in excess of the $1.4 billion target previously provided. Below the free cash flow line, we saw net working capital consume approximately $180 million of cash during the quarter as we continue to build both accounts receivable and inventory to support the ongoing and continuing sales ramp-up on both the OEM and aftermarket side of the business. The OEM does tend to be slightly more intensive from a net working capital standpoint.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.3x, down from the 5.6x at the end of last quarter. On a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, this puts us below the 5-year pre-covid average level of 6x. Additionally, our cash interest coverage ratio, which is EBITDA to interest expenses at 3x, which is right in line with where we've historically operated pre-COVID and been comfortable operating the business.\nAs always, we continue to watch the higher interest rate environment and the current state of the debt markets closely. As a reminder, we did a fair bit of refinancing in the first half of the year, pushing out over $8 billion of our nearest term maturities due in 2025 out to 2028. We expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our debt maturity stacks, which for us means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date, our nearest term maturity is now 2026.\nOver 75% of our total $20 billion gross debt balance is fixed or hedged through our fiscal 2026. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us adequate cushion against any rising rates, at least in the immediate term.\nAs we sit here today, from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in a good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation, it is likely we make a decision by the end of the calendar year based on current market conditions.\nWe have a sizable cash balance of close to $3.1 billion and consistent with history, when we have a significant amount of cash available, we aim to get the cash back to our shareholders in one form or another. All 3 capital allocation options, significant acquisitions share buybacks and dividends remain on the table.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Welcome to the Q2 2023 TransDigm Group Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Jaimie Stemen, the Director of Investor Relations for TransDigm. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Chief Operating Officer, Jorge Valladares; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information. Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements.\nFor further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov. The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliation.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, TransDigm Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '23 outlook.\nThen George and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.\nAbout 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products -- most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content; second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology; third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders; fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy where we see a clear path to PE-like returns.\nAnd lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had another strong quarter. Our Q2 results ran ahead of our expectation, and we once again raised our guidance for the year.\nWe continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and trends are still favorable as demand for travel remains robust. Global domestic air traffic continues to lead the recovery, [ international ] travel is also moving forward. China's air traffic has expanded significantly since its reopening in January, especially domestic air trap. However, there is still progress made for the industry as our results continue to be adversely affected in Carson to pre-pandemic levels since the demand for air travel is still slightly depressed from pre-COVID levels. In our business, we saw another quarter of substantial growth in our total commercial revenues and [ kinks ]. Revenues sequentially improved in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense, also bookings outpaced revenues for each of these market channels.\nEBITDA as defined margin improved to 51.3% in the quarter, contributing to the strong margin is our strict focus on our operating strategy and the ongoing recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues. Additionally, we generated about $130 million of operating cash flow in Q2 and ended the quarter with over $3.4 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. So an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities.\nDuring the quarter, we agreed to acquire Calspan Corporation for approximately $725 million in cash. The acquisition we are happy to report closed yesterday, May 8. Calspan has established positions across a diverse range of aftermarket focused aerospace and defense development and testing services. Calspan has a state-of-the-art transonic wind tunnel that utilizes -- that it utilizes to perform testing for both the commercial and defense aerospace markets. Calspan's unique service offerings exhibit the earnings stability and growth potential that are consistent with our aerospace components centered businesses. We are excited about the acquisition of Calspan and expect the business to meet or see our long-term value objectives.\nWe expect the Calspan acquisition to contribute just over $100 million to our fiscal year '23 revenue. And for the Calspan EBITDA as defined margin in fiscal year '23 to be just less than half of the TransDigm total company margin. Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we have a slightly stronger than typical pipeline of potential targets. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I can't predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nThe capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, do accretive M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends; a fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are currently evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict. We continue to maintain significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal year '23. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '23 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results, the recent acquisition of Calspan and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. Please note that as the Calspan acquisition just closed on May 8, we utilized the limited information currently available to include Calspan within our guidance. Our preliminary expectations for Calspan will be refined as necessary over the coming months.\nAt the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $300 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $150 million. The guidance assumes the continued recovery in our primary commercial [indiscernible] throughout the remainder of fiscal '23 and no additional acquisitions or divestitures. Our current year guidance is as follows and can be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is now $6.455 billion or up approximately 19%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the commercial OEM market and commercial aftermarket, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong second quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year.\nWe now expect commercial OEM revenue growth in the range of 20% to 25%, which is an increase from our previous guidance of mid-teens percentage range and expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the range of 25% to 30%, which is an increase from our previous guidance of high teens percentage range. The commercial aftermarket has been progressing well in our fiscal '23, and we hope that continues.\nHowever, we aim to be conservative with this guidance as the commercial aftermarket is harder to predict with many orders being book and ship and the advanced bookings only going out a few months or so into the future. Defense revenue guidance is still based on the previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions.\nWe are not updating the full year market channel growth rate for defense at this time as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. We expect defense revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.26 billion or up approximately 23% with an expected margin of around 50.5%.\nThis guidance includes about a 50 basis points of margin dilution from the DART Aerospace acquisition and just over 50 basis points of margin dilution from the recent Calspan acquisition. The pro forma margin dilution from Calspan, meaning if we had owned Calspan for all of fiscal year '23 is just over 100 basis points. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA as defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $23.75 or up approximately 39%.\nMike will discuss in more detail shortly some other fiscal '23 financial assumptions and updates. We believe we are well positioned for the second half of fiscal year '23. We will continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. Let me conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain committed to driving value for our [ shareholders ]. Now let me hand it over to Jorge to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJorge L. Valladares\n\nCOO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the balance of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2022, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion includes the May 2022 acquisition of [indiscernible] in both periods.\nDART has been included in this market discussion since the third quarter of fiscal '22. The recent May 2023 acquisition of Calspan Corporation is excluded from this market discussion. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 25% in Q2 compared with the prior year period.\nSequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by 17% and bookings improved over 15% compared to Q1. Bookings in the quarter were robust compared to the same prior year period and significantly outpaced sales. We're encouraged by the increasing commercial OEM production rates, while risks remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader Aerospace sector, we are cautiously optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production [ parts ].\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 38% in Q2 when compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q2.\nSequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues increased by approximately 14%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were strong this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q2 bookings outpaced sales. Turning to broader market dynamics. Global revenue passenger miles remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, but have further progressed over the past few months. IATA recently commented that despite uncertain economic signals, demand for air travel continues to be strong across the globe, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.\nChina air traffic specifically has seen a significant rebound after the lifting of COVID restrictions and the reopening of China to travel this past January. The recovery in domestic travel has made great strides over the past several months, primarily due to the sharp uptick in domestic air traffic in China. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for March global domestic air traffic was only down 1% compared to pre-pandemic.\nSimilarly, U.S. domestic travel in March was also only 1% below pre-pandemic levels. Domestic travel in China was down about 3% in March compared to pre-pandemic, which is a significant improvement from being down 55% only 3 months ago in December. International traffic also continues to improve but at a slower pace than domestic. Approximately a year ago, international travel globally was [indiscernible] about 52% and but in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for March, international travel was only down about 18% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nInternational traffic in North America and Europe were within 3% and 14% of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Asia Pacific International travel was still down about 36%, but should hopefully continue to improve as the China reopening progresses.\nGlobal air cargo volumes in the most recent March IATA data continue to be lower year-over-year and versus pre-pandemic levels. With the continued growth in passenger flying, especially the widebody recovery, there's more belly hold space available for cargo transport. The reopening of China has been positive for the air cargo outlook but global trade signals continue to be mixed. It's too early to determine where air cargo trends stabilize.\nBusiness jet utilization is below the pandemic highs in 2021 and continues to moderate. Business jet activity does remain above pre-pandemic levels and business jet OEMs and operators forecast strong demand in the near term. We'll see how this normalizes over the upcoming months. Now shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue.\nThe defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 5% in Q2 when compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total defense revenues grew by approximately 14%. Defense bookings are up this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q2 bookings solidly outpaced sales, which is a positive indicator for future defense order activity.\nOur defense market revenues continue to be impacted by the lag in U.S. government defense spend outlays. We continue to see steady improvement, but they still remain longer than historical average levels. Overall, our teams have made solid progress with the supply chain with the primary focus remaining on electronic component availability. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit percent range growth this year for our defense market revenues. Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by expressing how pleased I am by our operational performance in the second quarter of fiscal '23. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure, and executing with operational excellence.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on a few additional financial matters for the quarter and expectations for the full fiscal year.\nFirst, on organic growth and liquidity. In the second quarter, our organic growth rate was 17.6%, driven by the continued rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket -- end markets. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define at TransDigm as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $350 million for the quarter. Below that free cash flow line, we saw net working capital consume just over $220 million of cash during the quarter as we build both accounts receivable and inventory to support the ongoing and continuing sales ramp-up on both the OEM and aftermarket side of the business.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.6x, down from 6x at the end of last quarter. Pro forma for the Calspan acquisition, which [ we ] completed yesterday was $2.7 billion of cash and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 5.7x. On a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, that puts us below the 5-year pre-COVID average level of 6x. Additionally, our cash interest coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to interest expense, are currently in line with where we've historically operated and been comfortable operating the business.\nAs always, we continue to watch the rising interest rate environment in the current state of the debt markets very closely. During the [indiscernible] quarter, we completed refis of 2 of our nearest maturity term loans, E&S as well as the $1.1 billion senior secured 8% rate note that we took on at the outset of COVID [indiscernible] have an abundance of caution. The net effect is that we extended the debt maturities out from 2025 into 2028. While we ended up not needing the proceeds of that $1.1 billion insurance policy note, as we called it to withstand the COVID downturn, we felt it was prudent to have the excess cash as we headed into those tough times.\nWe'll continue to operate the business with that kind of conservatism when it comes to our capital structure in good times and bad and expect to remain proactive and prudent. Pro forma for this note refinancing and term loan extension, our nearest maturity is now 2026. As a result of these various refinancings, we had some puts and takes on interest expense, the net impact of which is that our interest expense estimate for FY '23 ticked up slightly, as you can see in today's updated guidance.\nOver 75% of our total $20 billion gross debt balance is fixed or hedged through fiscal '26, and this is achieved through a combination of the great notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term. Specifically on the interest rate hedging point, you'll see some detail on the 10-Q on new hedges that we put in place during this past quarter to extend our coverage out another year through fiscal '26. One special note on the cash mechanics of the debt refi due to the way the timing worked, we had $1.1 billion of restricted cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, but that cash was dispersed just after quarter end in the first couple of days of April when we successfully completed the retirement of the 8% bond [indiscernible].\nSo as of today, as it pertains to our balance sheet, the restricted cash balance as well as the amount due on that 8% debt note or both zero. As we sit here today, from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via buybacks or dividends during fiscal '23. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the call over to Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Chief Operating Officer, Jorge Valladares; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information. Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings call for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '23 outlook. Then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle.\nTo summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy specifically. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. We have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. We acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns.\nAnd lastly, our capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had a good start to fiscal '23 and increased our guidance for the year. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market. Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust.\nInternational air traffic is closing in on the domestic travel recovery and China reopened its air travel in January with the lifting of its pandemic restrictions. However, there is still progress to be made for the industry as our results to continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels since the demand for air travel is still depressed. In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy.\nAdditionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration.\nWe are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nRegarding the current M&A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&A opportunities that fit our model. Acquisition opportunity activity continues and we have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual, mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. Both the M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict, but especially so in these times.\nNow moving to our outlook for fiscal 2023. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '23 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance, both by $65 million to reflect our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. The guidance assumes the continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets through fiscal '23 and no additional acquisitions or divestitures. Our current year guidance is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is now $6.155 billion or up approximately 13%.\nIn regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the commercial aftermarket, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. We now expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the high teens percentage range, which is an increase from our previous guidance of mid-teens percentage range. At this time, we are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and defense as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed.\nCommercial OEM and defense revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions where we expect commercial OEM revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range and defense revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.11 billion or up approximately 18% with an expected margin of around 50.5%.\nThis guidance includes about 50 basis points of margin dilution from our recent DART Aerospace acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margins will continue to move up throughout the remainder of the year. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA as defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $22.17 or up approximately 29%.\nMike will discuss in more detail shortly some other fiscal '23 financial assumptions and updates. As our fiscal '23 progresses, should the favorable trends in the commercial aerospace market recovery continue, including the expansion of flight activity in China, we could see further upward revisions to our guidance. We believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2023. We'll continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly.\nOn the organization side, I wanted to announce the retirement of Halle Martin, our General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. Halle has been an integral part of our team since 2012 and long before as outside counsel. Jes Warren has been promoted from her position as Associate General Counsel to fill this critical role as part of our robust succession planning process. Thank you, Halle, for all of your great counsel and dedication to TransDigm.\nLet me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. Let me hand it over to Jorge to review our current -- our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJorge L. Valladares\n\nCOO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the balance of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2022. That is, assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion includes the May 2022 acquisition of DART Aerospace in both periods. DART has been included in this market analysis discussion since the third quarter of fiscal '22. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we'll split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket.\nOur total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 20% in Q1 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period and solidly outpaced sales. Sequentially, the bookings improved almost 15% compared to Q4. We continue to be encouraged by build rates steadily progressing at the commercial OEMs and the strong demand for new aircraft. However, ongoing labor instability and supply chain challenges across the broader aerospace sector present risks to achieving OEM production rates.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 31% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q1.\nSequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 7% and bookings grew more than 25%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were robust this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q1 bookings significantly outpaced sales. Turning to broader market dynamics. Global revenue passenger miles remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, but have continued to steadily trend upwards over the past few months. Airline passenger demand remained strong throughout the fall and holiday season. IATA currently forecast calendar year '23 air traffic will be within about 15% of pre-pandemic. The recovery in domestic travel continues to be stronger than international travel, although international traffic is catching up.\nIn the most recently reported IATA traffic data for December, global domestic air traffic was only down 20% compared to pre-pandemic. For the U.S., domestic travel in December was within 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Domestic travel in China continued to lag other major air traffic regions and was down about 55% compared to pre-pandemic. However, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the reopening of China to international travelers bodes well for air traffic growth. Roughly a year ago, international travel globally was depressed about 60%, but in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for December, international travel was only down about 25% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nInternational traffic in North America and Europe were within 5% and 15% of pre-pandemic, respectively. Asia Pacific International travel was still down about 50%, but should improve subsequent to the January reopening of China. Global air cargo demand has continued to pull back over the past few months. As of IATA's most recent data, December was another month in which air cargo volumes showed year-over-year decline and were below pre-pandemic levels. The recent easing of pandemic-related restrictions in China could be favorable for air cargo in '23, but it's too early to determine.\nBusiness jet utilization has come down from pandemic highs and has continued to temper over the past handful of months. However, activity is still above pre-pandemic levels and business jet OEMs and operators forecast strong demand in the near term. Time will tell how this plays out as there is softening optimism for the business jet market due to the uncertainty within the current macro and financial environment.\nShifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue, the defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 3% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period. Defense bookings are up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q1 bookings strongly outpaced sales, which bodes well for future defense order activity. Impacting our defense market revenues are the ongoing delays in the U.S. government defense spend outlays. While these delays appear to be slowly improving, they do remain longer than historical average levels. Our teams are steadily making progress with the supply chain, but continue to face challenges. The lack of electronic component availability continues to be the primary focus for our teams.\nAs Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit percent range growth this year for our defense market revenues. Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by stating how pleased I am by our operational performance in this first quarter of fiscal '23. We remain focused on our value drivers in meeting increased customer demand for our products. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nEVP & CFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on a few additional financial matters for the quarter and then expectations for the full fiscal year. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the first quarter, our organic growth rate was 15%, driven by the continued rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow which we traditionally define as EBITDA, less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $400 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was exactly 6x, down from 6.4x at the end of last quarter.\nOn a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, this puts us right at the 5-year pre-COVID average level. Additionally, our cash interest coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to interest expense are currently in line with where we've historically operated the business. We feel comfortable here given the benefit of our interest rate hedges and fixed rate debt instruments that were entered into in a lower interest rate environment. As always, we continue to watch the rising interest rate environment in the current state of the debt markets very closely.\nDuring the first quarter, we completed an extension of our nearest maturity term loan pushing the maturity date from mid-2024 out into 2027. Pro forma for this refinancing, our nearest term maturity is now 2025. As a result of this refi, our interest expense estimate for FY '23 ticked up very slightly, as you can see in today's updated interest expense guidance. Over 75% of our total $20 billion gross debt balance is at a fixed rate through a combination of fixed rate notes and interest rate caps and swaps through 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term.\nGoing forward, we expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our debt maturity stacks. Practically for us, this means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date and then also utilizing hedging instruments where we can in order to lock in the cash interest costs. As we sit here today from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends during fiscal '23. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.

To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we closed out the year with another good quarter considering the market environment. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and remain encouraged by the favorable trends in air traffic.\nOur Q4 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period as we are lapping the fourth fiscal quarter of '21, which was more heavily impacted by the pandemic. Although our results have improved over the prior year quarter, they continue to be adversely affected in the comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed.\nWe are happy to see the continuation of the favorable trends in global air traffic recovery with domestic air travel still leading and international air traffic catching up. The majority of countries have fully reopened to international travelers. However, China air traffic lags the recovery seen in other countries. Domestic air travel in China continues to experience (inaudible) strict COVID policies that limit travel. China's international air traffic remains very depressed and has only made modest improvement from COVID lows. In our bookings, we saw another quarter of robust growth in our commercial revenues and bookings.\nI am very pleased that despite this challenging environment, our EBITDA's defined margin was 49.8% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with our strict operational focus and disciplined approach to cost structure management.\nAdditionally, we had good operating cash flow generation in Q4 of almost $275 million and closed the quarter with approximately $3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash through 2023.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. During fiscal '22, we are pleased to have allocated about $2.4 billion of capital in the aggregate across M&A and return of capital to our shareholders. Specifically, these activities included the acquisition of DART Aerospace, a special dividend of $18.50 per share and share buybacks. As mentioned earlier, we are exiting fiscal 2022 with a sizable cash balance of approximately $3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nRegarding the current M&A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&A opportunities that fit our model. Acquisition opportunity activity continues, and we have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual, mostly in the small to midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. Both the M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict, but specifically so in these times.\nNow moving to our outlook for fiscal 2023. As you saw in the earnings release, we initiated full fiscal year 2023 guidance. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for a continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets through fiscal 2023. Guidance was previously suspended as a result of the significant disruption in our primary commercial end markets related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThroughout fiscal '22, we were encouraged by the recovery seen in our commercial revenues and strong booking trends. Total commercial bookings in fiscal '22 exceeded sales by a healthy double-digit percentage that supports the fiscal '23 commercial end market revenue guidance, which I will comment on shortly.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that the prevailing conditions will continue to evolve favorably. However, as our fiscal '23 progress, we will continue to monitor the ongoing uncertainty and risks and market conditions closely and will react as necessary. Changes in market conditions and the impact to our primary end markets could lead to revisions in our guidance for 2023.\nOur initial guidance for fiscal 2023 continuing operations is as follows and can also be found on Slide 7 in the presentation. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance is $6.09 billion or up approximately 12%. As a reminder and consistent with past years, with roughly 10% less working days than subsequent quarters, fiscal '23 Q1 revenues, EBITDA and EBITDA margins are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of '23.\nThis revenue guidance is based on the following market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range, commercial OEM revenue growth also in the mid-teens percentage range, and finally, defense revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range.\nThe midpoint of fiscal 2023 EBITDA as defined guidance is $3.045 billion or up approximately 15% with an expected margin of around 50%. This guidance includes about 50 basis points of margin dilution from our recent DART Aerospace acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margin will move up throughout the year, with Q1 being the lowest and sequentially lower than Q4 of our fiscal 2022.\nThe midpoint of adjusted EPS is anticipated to be $21.38 or up approximately 25%. Mike will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal 2023 financial assumptions and updates.\nWe believe we are well positioned as we enter fiscal '23. As usual, we'll closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. Let me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance in this period of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain sharply focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. We look forward to fiscal 2023 and the opportunity to continue to create value for our stakeholders through our consistent strategy.\nNow let me hand it over to Jorge to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJorge L. Valladares\n\nCOO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.\nI'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion includes the recent acquisition of DART Aerospace in both periods and the impact of any divestitures completed in fiscal 2021 are removed in both periods. We also included DART in this market analysis discussion in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we'll split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 29% in Q4 and approximately 24% for full year fiscal 2022 compared with prior year periods. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period and again outpaced sales.\nSequentially, total commercial OEM sales improved roughly 8% compared to Q3. We're encouraged by build rates steadily progressing at the commercial OEMs, but risks remain with regard to the achievement of certain OEM production rate targets due to ongoing labor shortages and supply chain issues across the broader aerospace sector.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 36% in Q4 and 43% for full year fiscal 2022 when compared with prior year periods. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued robust demand in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q3.\nSequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 6%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were strong this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q4 bookings once again outpaced sales.\nA few key points to consider. Global revenue passenger miles remained lower than pre-pandemic levels. Revenue passenger miles have generally continued to trend upwards over the past few months, although there was a slight pullback in August RPMs and September has remained relatively flat compared to August. This is primarily a result of softer domestic China traffic due to ongoing zero-COVID policies.\nCommentary from airlines in recent months regarding passenger demand continues to be positive. Despite the increase in airline ticket prices, passenger demand has remained strong as the summer travel season came to a close and we entered the fall season. The recovery in domestic travel continues to be stronger than international travel. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for September domestic air traffic was only down 19% compared to pre-pandemic. The U.S. and Europe continue to lead, showing strong demand for domestic travel.\nU.S. domestic travel in September was back to pre-pandemic levels. However, China's domestic travel had another steep drop off in September due to strict COVID policies and was down about 60% compared to pre-pandemic.\nThe international air traffic recovery has continued to make progress throughout 2022. Many countries have fully reopened international travelers, and there is pent-up demand for long-haul travel. Approximately 6 months ago, international travel was still down about 50%, but in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for September, international travel was only down about 30% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nInternational traffic in North America is within about 10% of pre-pandemic. In Europe, international traffic is within 20% or so of pre-pandemic. Asia Pacific international travel has made good progress over the past months, but RPMs are still down about 60%.\nGlobal air cargo demand has pulled back over the past months. As of IATA's most recent data, September was another month in which air cargo volume showed year-over-year decline and were below pre-pandemic levels. Further easing of pandemic-related restrictions and factory reopenings in China could support near-term improvement in air cargo, though uncertainty remains regarding China's timeline for full reopening.\nBusiness jet utilization has come down from pandemic highs, but is still well above pre-pandemic levels. Business jet OEMs and operators continue to forecast strong demand in the near term. There is growing optimism that the pandemic brought a favorable structural change to the business jet industry, time will tell.\nMoving on to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 2% in Q4 and declined by approximately 3% for full year fiscal 2022 when compared with prior year periods.\nThis year followed a typical pattern of irregular and lumpy defense sales and bookings. The lag in defense outlays and supply chain shortages were the main contributors to our softer-than-expected defense performance for 2022. Negatively impacting our defense market revenues were the delays in the U.S. government defense spend outlays. There's often a lag between U.S. government defense spend on [authorizations] and outlays, and the lag is hard to predict. While these delays have been longer than typical, we did see some improvement in bookings this quarter, which bodes well for future defense order activity.\nOn the supply chain, our teams continued to experience delays due to part shortages surrounding electronic components. Our operating units are proactively engaged with the supply chain and continue to implement mitigating actions to overcome these challenging issues. We do expect our defense business to expand in fiscal 2023 due to the strength of our current order book. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent range growth in fiscal 2023 for our defense market revenues.\nI'd like to finish by recognizing the strong efforts and accomplishments of our teams during this challenging fiscal year. I'm very pleased by our operational performance and our team's ability to overcome the negative impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions we experienced throughout the year. As we enter our new fiscal year, our management and their teams remain focused on our consistent operating strategy and meeting the demand for our products.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on a few additional financial matters for fiscal '22 and then also our expectations for fiscal '23.\nFirst, a few fiscal '22 data points on organic growth, taxes and liquidity. In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 16%, driven by the continued rebound and our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On taxes, our GAAP and adjusted tax rates finished the year within their expected ranges. Our FY '22 GAAP tax rate was 23% and the adjusted rate was just under 25%.\nOn cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, was just over $1.2 billion for the year, a bit higher than the $1.0 billion we had originally expected, driven primarily by the good operating performance that Kevin and Jorge mentioned.\nWe ended the year with approximately $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And at quarter end, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.4x, down from the 6.7x level where we finished last quarter when you pro forma in the $18.50 per share dividend that we paid in August.\nWe continue to watch the rising interest rate environment closely. We remain 85% hedged on our total $20 billion gross debt balance through a combination of interest rate caps and swaps through 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term.\nWith regard to any potential changes to our long-term approach to using debt to boost our equity returns, we'll see how the interest rate environment develops over the next 3 years, but do not anticipate any big changes in our approach at this time. Though one could envision a scenario where we slightly dial back the leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis to achieve the type of cash interest coverage ratios where we've historically operated and been comfortable operating the business.\nNext, on the FY '23 expectations. I'm going to really quickly give some more details on the financial assumptions around interest expense, taxes and share count. Net interest expense is expected to be about $1.14 billion in fiscal '23, and this equates to a weighted average cash interest rate of approximately 5.75%. This estimate assumes an average LIBOR rate of 4.9% for the full fiscal year, which is simply the average based on the current forward consensus LIBOR curve.\nOn taxes, our fiscal '23 GAAP cash and adjusted rates are all anticipated to be in the range of 24% to 26%. The slight increase in our tax rate versus the prior year is due mainly to the manner in which the net interest deduction limitation is calculated under existing tax legislation for fiscal '23 versus how it was computed in prior years.\nOn the share count, we expect our weighted average shares to be $57.1 million during fiscal '23, and this figure takes into account the 1.5 million shares we repurchased during the '22 fiscal year, but assumes no additional buybacks occurred during the '23 fiscal year.\nWith regard to liquidity and leverage for fiscal '23, we expect to continue running free cash flow positive throughout the year. As we traditionally define our free cash flow, which again is EBITDA as defined less cash interest, CapEx and cash taxes, we estimate this metric to be in the $1.4 billion area, maybe a little better in fiscal '23.\nAssuming no additional acquisitions or capital markets transactions, we'll end the year with well north of $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet and estimate that our net leverage will be in the area of 5x EBITDA as defined at September 30, 2023.\nFrom an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends during fiscal '23.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A."

Welcome to the TransDigm Q3 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Chief Operating Officer, Jorge Valladares; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nBefore we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors' section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referencing -- referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discussion of our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter.\nTo reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.\nAbout 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. We have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. We acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns.\nOur capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our earnings release, we had another good quarter considering the market environment. We remain encouraged by the positive trends in air traffic and the recovery we continue to see in the commercial aerospace market.\nOur Q3 results show positive growth in comparison to the same period in 2021 as we are lapping the third fiscal quarter of '21, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic. Although our results have improved over the prior year quarter, they continue to be unfavorably affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed. However, we are happy to see the continued steady improvement in global air traffic. Domestic air traffic remains the leader in the air traffic recovery, and international air traffic improved these past few months as more passengers return to long-haul travel.\nWith softened or fully lifted travel restrictions in majority of countries and the summer travel season upon us, passenger travel demand has been strong. China domestic air traffic remains low but is making progress from its most recent sharp drop-off due to strict Zero-COVID policies limiting travel. International traffic in China is finally starting to improve off of COVID lows.\nIn our business, we saw another quarter of robust growth in our commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings. I am very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment, our EBITDA as defined margin was 49.8% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues as well as the careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy.\nAdditionally, we had good operating cash flow generation in Q3 of over $300 million and closed the quarter with a little over $3.8 billion of cash. We expect to continue generating additional cash in our final quarter of fiscal 2022.\nNext, an update on our busy quarter for capital allocation activities. I am happy to report that during Q3, we opportunistically deployed $245 million of capital via open-market repurchases of our common stock. This equates to approximately 444,000 of our shares at an average price of $554 per share. Although the price remained attractive, we were limited this quarter on the quantum we could purchase after the completion of the DART acquisition. These repurchases are in addition to the approximately 1 million shares we repurchased in our Q2 for a total of over $900 million deployed this year on share repurchases. We view these repurchases like any other capital investment and expect this will meet or exceed our long-term objectives.\nAlso with respect to capital allocation and as we mentioned in our press release, we've decided to pay a special dividend of $18.50 per share. The dividend will be paid on August 26. Mike will address this and our buybacks more later.\nAs for acquisitions during the quarter, we completed the DART Aerospace acquisition for approximately $360 million in cash. DART is a leading provider of highly engineered unique helicopter solutions that mainly service civilian aircraft and fits well with our proprietary and aftermarket-focused value generation strategy. Although we are not providing formal revenue guidance, we expect the DART acquisition to contribute approximately $30 million to our FY '22 revenue.\nRegarding the current M&A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&A opportunities that fit our model. Acquisition opportunities continue, and we have a decent pipeline of possibilities, as usual, mostly in the small and midsize range. Although I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nIn aggregate, we have allocated about $2.4 billion of capital this year for value-generating activities. Pro forma for the special dividend payout in late August, we still expect to have a sizable cash balance of close to $3 billion. These capital allocation actions will still leave us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nNow moving to our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Consistent with our commentary on the last earnings call, at this time, we expect to reinitiate guidance on the November 2022 earnings call for our new fiscal year, assuming prevailing conditions continue to evolve. We remain encouraged by the recovery we have seen in our commercial OEM and aftermarket revenues and the strong bookings received for both thus far in fiscal 2022. We continue to expect COVID-19 to have an adverse impact on our financial results compared to pre-pandemic levels in our final quarter of fiscal 2022 under the assumption that both our commercial OEM and aftermarket customer demand will remain depressed due to lower worldwide air travel, although recent positive trends in commercial air traffic could impact us favorably.\nAs for the defense market, we're revising our defense revenue growth to flat for fiscal 2022 versus prior year. We have lowered our defense revenue expectations for fiscal 2022 primarily due to shipment delays as a result of limited supply chain shortages and delays in U.S. government defense spending outlays. As you know, bookings and shipments in this end market can often be quite lumpy. Jorge will provide more color on this topic in his section.\nWe expect full year fiscal 2022 EBITDA margin to now surpass 48% due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery. As a final note, this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our Cobham acquisition and DART acquisition of about [1.5%] this year.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the last quarter of our fiscal 2022. As usual, we'll closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets develop, and we'll react accordingly. Mike will provide details on other fiscal 2022 financial assumptions and updates.\nLet me conclude by stating that I'm pleased with the company's performance in this period of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on executing our operating strategy and managing our cost structure.\nNow let me hand it over to Jorge to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJorge L. Valladares\n\nCOO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion now includes the recent acquisition of DART Aerospace in both periods and the impact of any divestitures completed in fiscal 2021 are removed in both periods.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we'll split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 23% in Q3 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were up significantly compared to the same prior year period and again strongly outpaced sales. Sequentially, total commercial OEM sales improved almost 5% compared to Q2.\nWe're encouraged by build rates steadily progressing at the commercial OEMs. However, there have been overall downward revisions in expected future production rates by the commercial OEMs primarily due to labor shortages and supply chain issues. Our expectation remains that in the short term, the demand for our commercial OEM products will continue to be reduced.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 44% in Q3 when compared with prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by robust demand in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q3. Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 7%.\nCommercial aftermarket bookings were up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q3 bookings strongly outpaced sales. To touch on a few key points of consideration, global revenue passenger miles are still depressed compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, revenue passenger miles have continued to trend upwards over the past months after the slight pullback in January that was primarily due to the Omicron variant.\nThe continued recovery in air travel, especially the progress we have recently seen in international travel, confirms the pent-up demand to travel. Commentary from airlines in recent months has also been positive regarding robust passenger demand. Even with airline ticket prices higher than historical levels, passenger demand has remained strong in the summer season.\nThe recovery in domestic travel continues to be stronger than international travel. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for June, domestic air traffic was only down 19% compared to pre-pandemic. The U.S. and Europe continue to lead, showing strong demand for domestic travel. U.S. domestic travel is only off about 8% from pre-pandemic levels. China domestic travel is still down about 50% but is beginning to show signs of recovery from its most recent steep drop-off in air travel due to its Zero-COVID policies.\nThe international air traffic recovery has made strides over these past few months. With many of the government-imposed travel restrictions lifted, passengers have been returning to long-haul travel. In March, international travel was still down about 50%. But in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for June, international travel was only down about 35% compared to pre-pandemic levels. For both the U.S. and Europe, international traffic is within 20% or better of pre-pandemic levels. Asia Pacific international travel is improving but continues to unfavorably impact the overall international air traffic recovery with RPKs still down about 70%.\nGlobal air cargo demand has tempered over the past few months. As of IATA's most recent data, June was another month of year-over-year decline in air cargo volumes, though they remain above pre-pandemic levels. There's optimism for improvement in air cargo as COVID lockdown measures eased in Asia, particularly in China.\nBusiness jet utilization still remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Commentary from business jet OEMs and operators reflects confidence in the demand outlook. It's possible that the pandemic brought a positive structural change to biz jet demand, but that will take some time to prove out.\nNow let me speak about our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, was about flat in Q3 when compared with the prior year period. As we've said many times, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy.\nSimilar to the first half of 2022, our teams continue to experience delays in fulfilling orders due to supply chain shortages. The supply chain issues mainly surround the lack of availability of electronic components. Our operating units continue to implement mitigating actions to overcome these challenging issues.\nAlso impacting our defense market revenue are the delays in the U.S. government defense spend outlays. There's often a lag between U.S. government defense spend authorizations and outlays and the lag is hard to predict, but these delays are longer than typical.\nAs Kevin mentioned earlier and for the reasons I just discussed, we're revising down the expectation for our defense market revenue growth to about flat for fiscal 2022. We were previously expecting low single-digit percent range growth.\nI'd like to wrap up by expressing how extremely pleased I am with our strong operational performance this quarter. Our teams have continued to put forth significant efforts in overcoming the negative impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. We remain focused on our value drivers and executing with operational excellence.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on some additional financial matters for the quarter and also our expectations for the full fiscal year.\nFirst, in regard to profitability for our third quarter. EBITDA as defined of about $696 million for Q3 was up 25% versus prior year Q3. EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was 49.8%. This represents year-over-year improvement of about 390 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA as defined margin, increased by 210 basis points.\nNext, a few quick comments on select financial metrics for the quarter and also year. Organic growth was 17% for the quarter, driven by the growth in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On taxes, we still expect our GAAP and cash rates to be in the 21% to 23% range and our adjusted tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range for the year.\nMoving to cash and liquidity. We had another quarter of positive free cash flow. Free cash flow, which we traditionally define at TransDigm as EBITDA as defined less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, was roughly $400 million. For the full fiscal year, we now expect to generate free cash flow in excess of the $1 billion target previously provided.\nDuring the quarter, we used $245 million of cash to repurchase shares at a weighted average purchase price of about $554 per share and ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand. We view these share repurchases just like any other capital investment, such as the acquisition of a new business, and expect a similar rate of return.\nWith regard to the dividend, the $18.15 per share payment announced this morning represents a gross payout amount of about $1.070 billion. The record date for the dividend is August 19, and the payout date is expected to be August 26. Additionally, in the 10-Q that is filed later today, you'll see that our strong sales growth resulted in net working capital being a $119 million use of cash this quarter. As mentioned previously, we have the cash to fund this investment and are glad to see our primary commercial end markets rebounding and therefore driving this need.\nAs we continue to recover from COVID's impact on air travel and rebound to 2019 global activity levels, we'd expect an additional $100 million to $175 million of cash to go back into net working capital. The time line over which this will happen remains uncertain but should generally track the recovery.\nMoving on to leverage levels. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is currently at 6.3x. Pro forma for the dividend, our leverage level will be just over 6.7x net debt-to-EBITDA. We expect to continue running free cash flow-positive during our fourth quarter, and this ratio will therefore come down from the 6.7x level by the end of the fiscal year, barring any additional capital market transactions or shareholder distributions.\nWe are watching the rising interest rate environment closely, and we remain 85% hedged on our total $20 billion gross debt balance through a combination of interest rate caps and swaps through calendar year 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates for the time being.\nFinally, as Kevin mentioned, we are pleased to have allocated $2.4 billion of capital thus far this year across the range of options available to us: acquisitions, buybacks and dividends. Consistent with our past practices, we'll continue to evaluate this full range of options with regard to all of our future capital deployment actions. The priorities are unchanged: first, reinvesting in our own businesses; second, acquisitions; third, returning capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchases; and finally, paying down debt, which seems unlikely at this time but remains an option. From an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we believe we remain in a strong and good position going forward.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Stein\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning from Cleveland, and thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discussion of our fiscal 2022 outlook. Then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter.\nTo reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.\nAbout 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns.\nWe follow a consistent long-term strategy specifically. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. We have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders.\nWe acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. Our capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nAs you saw from our earnings release, we had another good quarter considering the market environment. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and are encouraged by the trends in air traffic among other factors. Our Q2 results show positive growth in comparison to the same period in 2021 as we are lapping the second fiscal quarter of '21, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic and then relative availability of vaccines. Although our results have improved, they continue to be unfavorably affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed.\nHowever, the continued steady improvement in global air traffic is encouraging. There was a slight pullback in flight traffic in January as a result of the Omicron variant after strong December holiday travel, but traffic has continued to progress forward since then. It further illustrates the pent-up demand for air travel and bodes well for the continued momentum of the commercial aerospace recovery throughout 2022.\nTo date, the recovery has remained primarily driven by domestic leisure travel, though international travel is slowly improving as many governments across the world have softened or fully lifted travel restrictions. China continues to be a watch point as both international and domestic traffic in China is near COVID lows due to strict zero COVID policies limiting travel.\nIn our business, we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in our total commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings with both up approximately 10% over Q1 of fiscal 2022. I am very pleased that despite this challenging commercial environment, our EBITDA as defined margin was 47.7% in the quarter.\nContributing to this strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues as well as the careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy. This was achieved despite the Omicron variant impacting travel in the beginning of Q2 and the sharp drop-off in China air traffic during the quarter.\nAdditionally, we continue to generate cash in Q2. We had operating cash flow generation of almost $90 million and closed the quarter with a little over $4.2 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2022.\nNext, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. I am happy to report that during Q2, we opportunistically deployed $667 million of capital via open market repurchases of our common stock. This equates to approximately 1 million of our shares at an average price of $637 per share. We view these repurchases like any other capital investment and expect this will meet or exceed our long-term return objectives. Mike will address this more later.\nAlso during the quarter, we agreed to acquire DART Aerospace for approximately $360 million in cash. DART is a leading provider of highly engineered unique helicopter solutions that mainly service civilian aircraft. DART is expected to generate approximately $100 million in pro forma revenue for the calendar year ending December 31, 2022, and it fits well with our proprietary and aftermarket focused value generation strategy. The acquisition is currently expected to close during the second half of our fiscal 2022.\nPro forma for the closing of the DART acquisition, we still expect to have a sizable cash balance of close to $4 billion. This assumes announced share repurchases and DART closing, which together allocates approximately $1 billion of capital for value-generating investments.\nWe continue to evaluate our capital allocation options regarding additional acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends. All 3 options remain on the table, each individually but then also potentially in some combination over the next 9 months or so. Any significant M&A, share buyback and/or dividend activity will still leave the company with substantial liquidity and the financial flexibility to deal with any currently anticipated capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nWe continue to look at possible M&A opportunities and are always attentive to our capital allocation. Both the M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict but especially so in these times. Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&A opportunities that fit our model. Acquisition opportunity activity continues to accelerate and is approaching pre-COVID levels. We have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual, mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings. We remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nNow moving to our outlook for 2022. We are still not in a position to provide full financial guidance as a result of the continued disruption in our primary commercial end markets. We continue to be encouraged by the recovery we have seen in our commercial OEM and aftermarket revenues and the strong bookings received for both thus far in fiscal 2022. At this time, we expect to reinitiate guidance on the November 2022 earnings call for our new fiscal year, assuming prevailing conditions continue to evolve favorably.\nWe continue to expect COVID-19 to have an adverse impact on our financial results compared to pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2022 under the assumption that both our commercial OEM and aftermarket customer demand will remain depressed due to lower worldwide air travel, although recent positive trends in commercial air traffic could impact us favorably.\nWith regard to internal planning, our teams are now resource planning for commercial aftermarket revenue to grow ahead of the 20% to 30% sizing range previously provided. We expect our commercial OEM revenue to grow significantly as well but at a rate less than the commercial aftermarket rate of growth. As you know, we aim to be conservative.\nAs for the defense market, we still expect defense revenue growth in the low single-digit percent range for fiscal 2022 versus prior year despite the slow first half of the year. Jorge will provide more color on our defense end market. As you know, this end market can often be quite lumpy on a quarterly basis.\nWe now expect full year fiscal 2022 EBITDA margin to be approaching 48% due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery. We anticipate EBITDA margins will continue to move up throughout the second half of our fiscal year. As a note, this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our Cobham acquisition of about 0.5% this year.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the second half of fiscal 2022. As usual, we'll closely watch the aerospace and capital markets and see how they develop and react accordingly. Mike will provide details on other fiscal 2022 financial assumptions and updates.\nLet me conclude by stating that I'm pleased with the company's performance in this period of gradual recovery for the commercial aerospace industry and with our commitment to driving value for our stakeholders. We remain focused on executing our operating strategy and managing our cost structure as we continue on this path to a full recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We look forward to the remainder of fiscal 2022 and the opportunity to continue to create value for our stakeholders through our consistent strategy.\nNow let me hand it over to Jorge to review our recent performance and a few other items.\n\nJorge L. Valladares\n\nCOO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Kevin. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Any acquisitions are included in both periods and the impact of any divestitures is removed in both periods.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 28% in Q2 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period and again significantly outpaced sales. Sequentially, bookings improved almost 10% compared to Q1 with sales improving almost 15%.\nWhile we expect demand for our commercial OEM products to continue to be reduced in the short term, we are encouraged by build rates gradually progressing at the commercial OEMs.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 46% in Q2 when compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by increased demand in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q2.\nSequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings both grew by approximately 10%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were up this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q2 bookings strongly outpaced sales.\nTo touch on a few key points of consideration, global revenue passenger miles remained depressed. There was a modest sequential decline in revenue passenger miles in January due to the Omicron variant and a tough comparison to December holiday travel. However, revenue passenger miles have continued to improve since January.\nThe limited impact on air travel from the Omicron variant, along with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began at the end of February, demonstrates the strong underlying demand and willingness of passengers to travel. This provides optimism for the pace of the recovery of air traffic in the remainder of 2022. IATA also recently stated that based on the current recovery momentum, they expect passenger traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, which is a year earlier than previously forecast.\nThe recovery in domestic travel continues to be more resilient than international. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for March, domestic air travel was only down 23% and compared to pre-pandemic, while international travel was down about 50%. The U.S. and Europe continue to show strong demand for domestic travel, although China has been more volatile due to its zero COVID policies, which caused localized lockdowns and rapid drop-offs in air travel.\nThough the pace of the international air traffic recovery has been slow, it is steadily progressing. And we're hopeful for improvement in international travel in the remainder of 2022. Many of the government imposed travel restrictions have softened or lifted entirely, which is encouraging.\nGlobal cargo volumes continue to be strong, although airfreight demand has tempered a bit recently. This trend could continue as the year progresses due to unfavorable impacts on air freight from the lockdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Time will tell.\nBusiness jet utilization remains robust. Commentary from business jet OEMs and operators remains positive, and these higher levels of business jet activity appeared likely to continue in the near term.\nNow let me speak about our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, decreased by approximately 2% in Q2 when compared with the prior year period. As we've said many times, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy.\nSimilar to Q1, our teams continue to be challenged with supply chain induced delays in fulfilling orders. The supply chain issues primarily surround the lack of availability of electronic components. Our operating units are actively pursuing mitigating actions to overcome these issues. Our defense order book remains strong and bookings this quarter improved 30% sequentially versus Q1. We expect our defense business to expand throughout the remainder of the year.\nAs Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low single-digit percent range growth in fiscal 2022 for our defense market revenues.\nI'd like to finish by recognizing the strong efforts of our teams in continuing to overcome the negative impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. We remained focused on our value drivers and meeting the increased demand for our products.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on some additional financial matters for the quarter and also our expectations for the full fiscal year.\nFirst, in regard to profitability for our second quarter, EBITDA as defined of about $633 million for Q2 was up 22% versus prior Q2. EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was approximately 47.7%. This represents a year-over-year improvement in our EBITDA as defined margin of about 420 basis points versus Q2 of last year. Sequentially, the margin increased by 40 basis points versus last quarter, and we expect this improvement trend to continue for the balance of the fiscal year.\nNext, a few additional comments on select financial metrics for the quarter and again also the full year. Organic growth was 15% for the quarter driven by the rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On taxes, we're revising our expected adjusted tax rate for this fiscal year downwards slightly to a range of 24% to 26%. Our GAAP and cash tax rate guidance is unchanged and still expected to be in the 21% to 23% range.\nMoving over to cash and liquidity. We had another quarter of positive free cash flow. Free cash flow, which we traditionally define at TransDigm as EBITDA as defined less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $222 million. As noted in the press release, this amount was slightly lower this quarter, but this is just timing.\nSpecifically, due to the quarter end date of April 2, we picked up an extra cash interest payment that was made on April 1. In addition, we had higher cash tax payments in the quarter. As we mentioned before, cash tax payments and cash interest payments can be lumpy across the quarters.\nFor the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged from the November earnings call. That is, we still anticipate free cash flow to be in the $1 billion area for the fiscal year, maybe a little better.\nAs Kevin mentioned, we used $667 million of cash to repurchase shares during the quarter at a weighted average purchase price of about $637 per share and ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash. In total, we repurchased about 1.05 million shares and did it through an open market repurchase program. We view and model these share repurchases just like any other capital investment such as the acquisition of a new business and expect a similar rate of return.\nAdditionally, in the 10-Q that is filed later today, you'll see that our strong sales rebound resulted in net working capital being a $130 million use of cash this quarter. This resulted in less cash being booked to our balance sheet than in prior quarters. As mentioned previously, we have the cash to fund this investment, and we're glad to see our primary commercial end markets rebounding and therefore, driving this need.\nAs we continue to recover from COVID's impact on air travel and recovered to 2019 global activity levels, we'd expect an additional $200 million to $275 million of cash to go back into net working capital. The timeline over which this will happen remains uncertain but should generally track to recovery.\nMoving on to leverage levels. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is currently at 6.6x, down from 8.2x at its peak at the end of our fiscal '21 second quarter. We expect to continue running free cash flow positive for the balance of our 2022 fiscal year. Barring any additional capital markets activities such as dividends or share repurchases, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will keep ticking down as the year progresses.\nWe are watching the rising interest rate environment closely. We remain 85% hedged on our $20 billion gross debt balance through a combination of interest rate caps and swaps that go out through calendar year 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates. We have included a supporting sensitivity table in today's slide deck that shows you what our annual cash interest expense will be at a range of 3-month LIBOR values.\nIn summary, from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we remain in good position and well prepared to withstand the still depressed but now rebounding commercial aerospace environment for quite some time.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program may be recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJaimie Stemen\n\nManager of Financial Reporting, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2022 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Chief Operating Officer, Jorge Valladares; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nBefore we begin, the company would like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Stein\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nGood morning, and thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy and then a few comments about the quarter and a discussion of our fiscal 2022 outlook, then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good and bad times as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle.\nTo summarize here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and over 3/4 of our net sales come from products, which we believe we are the sole source provider. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.\nWe utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. We have a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system, closely aligned with shareholders. Next, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And finally, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market.\nTo do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had a good quarter, considering the market environment. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and are encouraged by the trends in air traffic among other factors. Our Q1 fiscal results show positive growth in comparison to the same period in fiscal 2021 as we are lapping the first quarter of 2021, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic and prior to the widespread availability of vaccines. Although our results have improved, they continue to be unfavorably affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed.\nHowever, the continued improvement in global air traffic despite emergence of a new COVID-19 variant in late 2021 is encouraging. It further illustrates the pent-up demand for air travel and bodes well for the momentum of the commercial aerospace recovery in 2022. To date, the recovery has remained primarily driven by domestic leisure travel, although we are optimistic for recovery of international travel as many governments across the world have softened travel restrictions. Even the travel restrictions reimposed by certain governments during the months of December due to the Omicron variant are now starting to ease, which is again an encouraging sign. In our business, we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in our commercial markets, with total commercial aftermarket revenues up 10% over Q4 of fiscal 2021 and bookings up more than 15% compared to Q4.\nCommercial OEM bookings came in even stronger with almost 20% sequential improvement over Q4. I am also very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment, our EBITDA as defined margin was 47.3% in the quarter. Contributing to this better-than-expected margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues as well as the careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy.\nThis was achieved despite the emergence of the Omicron variant during the quarter. Additionally, we continued to generate significant cash in Q1. We had strong operating cash flow generation of almost $280 million and closed the quarter with a little over $4.8 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2022. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. We are now at a decision point with regard to our sizable cash balance, which is now approaching $5 billion.\nConsistent with our history. When we have a significant amount of cash available, we aim to give that back to the shareholders in 1 form or another. At this time, we're still in the process of evaluating our capital allocation options with regard to any significant acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends. All 3 options are on the table each individually, but then also potentially in some combination over the next 12 months. Any significant M&A, share buyback and/or dividend activity will still leave the company with substantial liquidity and the financial flexibility to deal with any currently anticipated capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.\nWe continue to look at possible M&A opportunities and are always attentive to our capital allocation. Both the M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict, but especially so in these times. Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we are still actively looking for M&A opportunities that fit our model. We continue to see a pickup in acquisition opportunity activity, but it's still slower than pre-COVID. We have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual, mostly in the small midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.\nNow moving to our outlook for 2022. We are still not in a position to provide full financial guidance as a result of the continued disruption in our primary commercial end markets. We continue to be encouraged by the recovery we have seen in our commercial aftermarket revenues and the strong bookings received for both commercial OEM and aftermarket in Q1. We will look to reinstitute guidance when we have a clearer picture of the future. We continue to expect COVID-19 to have an adverse impact on our financial results compared to pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2022 under the assumption that both our commercial OEM and aftermarket customer demand will remain depressed due to lower worldwide air travel. Although recent positive trends in commercial air traffic could impact us favorably. To reiterate what we said on the Q4 earnings call, our teams are still planning for our commercial aftermarket revenue to grow in the 20% to 30% range. We expect our commercial OEM revenue to grow significantly as well, but at a rate slightly less than the commercial aftermarket.\nAs you know, we aim to be conservative and would be happy to have both of these end markets rebound more strongly. To reiterate, these are planning assumptions for organizational purposes and not guidance. As for the defense market, we still expect defense revenue growth in the low single-digit percent range from fiscal 2022 versus prior year despite the slow start to the year. Jorge will provide more color on our defense end market. We now expect full year fiscal 2022 EBITDA margin to be slightly north of 47% due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery. Please note that our Q1 EBITDA margin was stronger than anticipated, and we may see less year-over-year margin improvement for Q2 and expect margins to move up throughout the second half of the fiscal year.\nAs a final note, this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our Cobham acquisition of about 0.5%. We believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2022. As usual, we'll closely watch the aerospace and capital markets as they develop and will react accordingly. Mike will provide details on other fiscal 2022 financial assumptions and updates.\nNow shifting gears for a moment to nonfinancial matters. I'd like to touch on our DoD IG audit report, which was released in mid-December. As we expected and communicated, the audit scope and results were similar to prior audits. The report found no legal wrongdoing on behalf of TransDigm or any of our employees. The report asked for a purely voluntary refund of approximately $21 million. We disagree with many of the implications contained in the report as well as the methodology used to arrive at many of the reports conclusions. We also disagree with the use of arbitrary standards and analysis, which render many areas of the report inaccurate and misleading. Additionally, at the request of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, we participated in a hearing on January 19 to discuss the results of the audit.\nGoing forward, we will continue to work with the IG, the DLA and any other relevant parties to evaluate the results of this audit. The U.S. government and the [U.S. warfighter] remain top priorities for TransDigm. At this time, we are engaged directly with the DLA and do not have any further update on whether or not we expect to pay all or a portion of the $21 million voluntary refund request.\nFinally, I wanted to announce the retirement of our Vice Chairman, Bob Henderson. He retired at the end of first fiscal quarter. Bob has been a key member of the TransDigm management team for over 25 years and a significant partner in the company's growth during the entire period. He served in a range of roles over his years with TransDigm, including as President of several operating units, Executive Vice President, COO of TransDigm's Airframe Business Group and most recently, Vice Chairman, where he oversaw the integration of the operating units acquired as part of the Esterline transaction. We wish Bob well in his retirement. Let me conclude by stating that I'm pleased with the company's performance in this challenging time for the commercial aerospace industry and with our commitment to driving value for our stakeholders.\nAs always, we remain focused on executing our operating strategy and managing our cost structure as we continue on this journey to a full recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2022 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us. Now let me hand it over to Jorge to review our performance and a few other items.\n\nJorge L. Valladares\n\nCOO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Kevin. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. This market discussion includes the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity. We began to include Cobham in this market analysis discussion in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. This market discussion also removes the impact of any divestitures completed in fiscal 2021.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 13% in Q1 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were robust compared to the same prior year period and strongly outpaced sales. Sequentially, the bookings improved almost 20% compared to Q4. Although we expect demand for our commercial OEM products to continue to be reduced in the short term, we are encouraged by build rates gradually progressing at the commercial OEMs.\nWe are hopeful that the narrow-body rate ramps disclosed by Airbus and Boeing will play out as forecasted. Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 49% in Q1 when compared with prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by increased demand in our passenger submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q1.\nSequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew approximately 10% and bookings grew more than 15%. Commercial aftermarket bookings are up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q1 bookings strongly outpaced sales. To touch on a few key points of consideration, global revenue passenger miles remained low but continued to modestly improve throughout our Q1.\nIATA currently forecasts a 39% decrease in revenue passenger miles in calendar year 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. Within IATA's estimate is the expectation that domestic travel will be back to 93% of pre-pandemic levels in calendar year 2022. Despite the impact of the Omicron variant, December global revenue passenger miles still improved month-on-month, which demonstrates the strong underlying demand and the willingness of passengers to travel. Countries that reimposed travel restrictions due to this variant are already announcing significant easing of those restrictions. The limited impact from the Omicron variant on air travel provides optimism for the pace of the recovery of air traffic in 2022.\nThe recovery in domestic travel has been more resilient than international. Domestic air traffic for calendar 2021 was only down 28% compared to pre-pandemic versus international, which was still down 75%. As the commercial aerospace recovery has progressed, the U.S. and Europe have shown strong demand for domestic travel. China has been more volatile due to its Zero COVID policies, which lead to localized lockdowns and rapid drop-offs in air travel. Though the pace of the international air traffic recovery has been slow, we are hopeful for improvement in international travel in 2022 as vaccination rates continue to improve globally and many of the government travel restrictions are softening.\nGlobal cargo volumes continue to surpass pre-COVID levels and it is generally expected that airfreight demand will remain robust throughout 2022. Business jet utilization remained strong. Commentary from business jet OEMs and operators have been encouraging and these higher levels of business jet activity may be here to stay, though time will tell. Now let me speak about our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue.\nThe defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, decreased by approximately 12% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period. As we have said many times, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. This quarter, Cobham was lapping a very tough prior year comparison as Cobham's defense sales accelerated in fiscal Q1 2021, which was the last quarter prior to TransDigm's ownership. This was the single largest contributor to the year-over-year decline.\nThere are also some supply chain induced delays in fulfilling orders at certain operating units. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low single-digit percent range growth in fiscal 2022 for our defense market revenues. Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by stating how pleased I am by our operational performance in this first quarter of fiscal 2022, despite the continued impact of the pandemic. We remain focused on our value drivers and executing with operational excellence. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.\n\nMichael J. Lisman\n\nCFO, TransDigm Group Incorporated\n\nMorning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on some additional financial matters for the quarter and then our expectations for the full fiscal year. First, in regard to profitability for the quarter, EBITDA [as defined of about $565 million] for Q1 was up 19% versus our prior Q1. EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was approximately 47.3%. This represents year-over-year improvement in our EBITDA as defined margin of about 450 basis points versus Q1 of last year. Sequentially, EBITDA as defined margin declined slightly by about 200 basis points during Q1 versus Q4 of last fiscal year.\nAs you know, this is typically the case for us given the higher volume levels in Q4 and lower number of working days in our fiscal Q1. Now a few quick additional financial data points for the quarter. Organic growth was 9%, driven by the rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On taxes, the slightly lower-than-expected GAAP rate for the quarter was driven by significant tax benefits arising from equity compensation deductions.\nThis is just timing. Barring some deviations in the rates for this first quarter, our tax rate guidance for the full year is unchanged from what we provided on our last earnings call. Moving to cash and liquidity. We had another nice quarter on free cash flow. Free cash flow, which we traditionally defined at TransDigm as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $250 million. We ended the quarter with about $4.8 billion of cash.\nDuring Q1, we also paid down our $200 million revolver balance, which was drawn at the onset of COVID in March of 2020 out of an abundance of caution. The $200 million revolver paydown is the primary reason that our cash balance ticked up much less than the $250 million of free cash flow we generated in Q1. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now at 6.7x. This ratio is down from 8.2x at its peak. We expect to continue running free cash flow positive. And barring any additional capital markets activities, this ratio would keep coming down as we proceed through our fiscal '22. From an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we remain in good position and well prepared to withstand the currently depressed but now rebounding commercial environment for quite some time.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."

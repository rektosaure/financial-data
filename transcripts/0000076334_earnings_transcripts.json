[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Chloe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Parker's fiscal year 2026 first quarter earnings release webcast. This is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer, speaking. And with me today is Jenny Parmentier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. And always, we appreciate your interest in Parker, and thank you for joining us today.\nWe address our disclosures on forward-looking projections and non-GAAP financial measures on Slide 2. Items listed here could cause actual results to vary from our forecast. Our press release was released this morning, along with this presentation. And reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures, those are available on our website under the Investors section on parker.com.\nThe agenda for today has Jenny starting with an overview of our record FY '26 first quarter performance. She will share some highlights from our day 1 celebrations welcoming the Curtis team members to Parker. Jenny will also then reiterate the strength of our interconnected portfolio and share an example from our energy market vertical. I will follow Jenny with more details on our strong first quarter results. And then we'll both provide some color on our increase to our FY '26 guidance. After that, we will move to the Q&A portion of the call and address as many questions as possible within the hour.\nI now call your attention to Slide 3. And Jenny, I will hand it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and thank you to everyone for attending the call today. Q1 was a great start to the fiscal year. Operational excellence was on full display, powered by The Win Strategy. We achieved top-quartile safety performance with a 20% reduction in our reportable incident rate. This performance is aligned with our goal to be the safest industrial company in the world.\nOur team delivered record Q1 sales of $5.1 billion, organic growth of 5% and 170 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in 27.4% adjusted segment operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share grew 16% and cash flow from operations was $782 million, and we completed the acquisition of Curtis Instruments.\nNext slide, please. A long-standing practice within Parker is for a partner leader to personally welcome a new team at every location. This slide shows pictures from our day 1 events held around the world, welcoming the Curtis team to Parker. This was a great day for all of us, and we are thrilled to have Curtis in the Parker portfolio.\nNext slide, please. Obviously, we are very proud of the Q1 results delivered by our team and equally excited about our future. So just a reminder on why we win. First, The Win Strategy is our business system. We have a decentralized operating structure: 85 divisions run by general managers with full P&L responsibility, acting like owners, close to their customers and executing The Win Strategy every day.\nNext, we have innovative products that solve customer problems, 85% covered by intellectual property. Our application engineers provide the expertise that allows us to have a competitive advantage with our interconnected technologies that provide efficient solutions for our customers.\nAnd finally, our distribution network is the envy of the competition and the best in the world. It took us over 60 years to build it, and it is truly an extension of our engineering teams, providing solutions to all of those small to midsize OEMs that are participating in capital spending and investments. These partners are experts at applying our interconnected technology.\nNext slide, please. We have the #1 position in the $145 billion motion and control industry, a growing space where we continue to gain share. These 6 market verticals represent greater than 90% of the company's revenue. Our interconnected technologies cut across these market verticals and give us a clear competitive advantage. 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy 4 are more technologies, and our growth is focused on faster-growing, longer-cycle markets and secular trends.\nNext slide, please. This slide focuses on our presence in the energy market vertical. Parker is a significant supplier of products into heavy-duty gas turbines used for electrical power generation. We bring both proprietary designs and world-class manufacturing capabilities to offer a comprehensive suite of interconnected technologies. Parker supports multiple global industry-leading customers, and we are seeing significant growth in this space. This business is a long life cycle with multiyear backlog and durable aftermarket. This is a great example of products and technology that are shared across aerospace and industrial markets.\nI'll hand it back to Todd to go through our first quarter highlights.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. This was a great start to the fiscal year. I'm on Slide 9, and I will start with a summary of our Q1 results. Once again, and I love saying this, every number in the gold column on this slide is a record. It was just a fantastic quarter where mid-single-digit sales growth, combined with strong margin expansion, resulting in mid-teens EPS growth.\nSales were up 4% versus prior. Organic growth was positive at plus 5%. Currency was favorable at 1%. And divestitures were 2% unfavorable. Those are the divestitures that we've previously completed. And I would just note, this is the last full quarter that we will have a full quarter of a divestiture impact.\nMoving to adjusted segment operating margins. As Jenny said, we did 27.4%, that's an increase of 170 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.3%, that was up 240 basis points. And adjusted net income was $927 million or 18.2% return on sales. All of this drove adjusted earnings per share up 16% to reach a record $7.22 per share.\nIt was a really nice start to the fiscal year with a strong quarter across the board, and it gives us confidence for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our global team members really continue to drive results enabled by the power of The Win Strategy.\nIf we could jump to Slide 10, you'll see a bridge on the year-over-year improvement in adjusted EPS. The majority of our EPS growth came from continued strength across our operations as segment operating income dollars increased by $132 million or 10%. That contributed $0.80 to our EPS growth this quarter.\nCorporate G&A and other were favorable $0.18. That was primarily due to foreign currency exchange in the prior period quarter last year, that was unfavorable last year, that created a favorable for this year. Interest expense was also favorable by $0.07, and that's driven by lower average debt balances across the quarter and lower interest rates across the quarter.\nShare count was $0.13 favorable, and that was driven by the discretionary share repurchases that we completed over the last 3 quarters.\nIncome tax was unfavorable by $0.16, and that was really simply due to a few favorable discrete items in the prior period that did not repeat. And that is basically it, a really clean bridge to the 16% increase in adjusted EPS. This record was really achieved by strong sales growth across the board, margin expansion and great adherence to cost controls across the company.\nIf we move to Slide 11, we'll just talk about the segment performance. Orders were strong at plus 8% versus prior year, with order rates increasing across all reported segments. Organic growth came in at plus 5%. This was the first time in 2 years we've had positive organic growth across all of our businesses as diversified industrial organic growth turned positive. Every business delivered record adjusted segment operating margins, resulting in great incrementals and that 170 basis points of margin expansion.\nLooking specifically at the Diversified Industrial North America businesses. Sales were over $2 billion with organic growth positive at 2%. That's the first time in 7 quarters north America posted a positive organic growth number [ at the end of the ] quarter. We continue to see gradual improvement across market verticals with positive growth driven by the aerospace and defense businesses in Industrial North America, in the implant and industrial equipment vertical and also improvement in off-highway that exceeded expectations.\nIf you look at North America, they also had 170 basis points of margin expansion and reached a record 27.0% segment operating margin. That was really driven by higher productivity, some new business wins at great margins and margin mix with strong aftermarket across all those businesses in North America. And North American orders increased sequentially to plus 3% versus prior year.\nLooking at the Diversified Industrial International businesses. Sales were up. They were a record at $1.4 billion, up 3% versus prior. Organic growth remained positive at plus 1%. Looking at Asia Pacific, that was our strongest region with a plus 6%. EMEA remained down at minus 3% and Latin America was flat versus the prior year. So Asia Pac really drove the outperformance of growth in the international businesses.\nAdjusted segment operating margins were also a record at 25.0%, that is a 90 basis point improvement from prior year. And I can't say this enough, our international teams continue to show great resilience, they're driving margin expansion and its really great cost controls, and they're really executing The Win Strategy to great success.\nInternational orders rebounded, they improved to plus 6% after a flat Q4. Both EMEA and Asia Pac had positive orders this quarter.\nAnd lastly, Aerospace Systems, just another exceptional quarter from this group. Sales were a record $1.6 billion. That's an increase of 13% versus prior. Organic growth of 13%. That's the 11th quarter in a row that we've had double-digit organic growth rate in Aerospace. Commercial OEM is the strongest market segment growing 24% versus prior year.\nAdjusted segment operating margins increased by 210 basis points and, I'm proud to say, reached 30% for the first time ever. Record top line, productivity, continued aftermarket strength all drove the margin expansion. And aerospace orders continue to be impressive, increasing plus 15%, and backlog also reached a new level -- record level for aerospace. There's just robust demand, and that continues across all of our aero and defense markets. It's great to be in the aerospace business right now.\nIf we move to Slide 12, let's look at our cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations, a record $782 million, that's 15.4% of sales. That's up 5% versus prior year. Free cash flow is $693 million, that is 13.6% of sales. That is up 7% versus prior year. Cash flow conversion for the quarter is at 86%. I just want to remind everybody, I think everyone knows this, but our cash flow is historically second half weighted. We remain committed to free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% for the year.\nAnd lastly, on this slide, we did repurchase $475 million of shares on a discretionary basis within the quarter.\nThat is a wrap on Q1. And Jenny, I'm going to turn it back to you on Slide 14, and we'll move on to our updated fiscal year guidance.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. This slide shows our updated fiscal year '26 organic sales growth forecast by key market verticals. In Aerospace, we are increasing our forecast from 8% to 9.5% organic growth. We continue to see strength in commercial OEM and aftermarket. Implant and Industrial remains the same as our initial guidance at positive low single-digit organic growth. The sentiment does remain positive with continued quoting activity while customer CapEx spending remains selective.\nTransportation is our most challenged market this year. Forecast stays the same at mid-single-digit organic decline.\nWe are increasing the off-highway forecast from negative low single digits to neutral. We see gradual recovery progress in construction, while the ag challenges do persist.\nWe are maintaining energy at positive low single-digit growth, with robust power gen activity offset by oil and gas. And we are increasing HVAC/refrigeration from positive low single digits to positive mid-single digits. We see strength in commercial refrigeration and filtration with some nice new business wins with our filtration technology.\nAs a result of these changes, we are increasing our organic sales growth guidance from 3% to 4% at the midpoint. I'll give it back to Todd for some more guidance details.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Jenny. I'm on 15, Slide 15, with just some of those details. In respect to reported sales, we are increasing the range to 4% to 7% or 5.5% at the midpoint. Currency is expected to be a favorable 1.5 points, and that is based on September 30 spot rates. .\nNow that we have the acquisition of Curtis closed, we are including sales and segment operating income from Curtis in our guide. We have added $235 million to our guide for the remainder of the year, that is approximately 1% of sales. And divestitures that we've already previously completed are 1% unfavorable.\nIf you move to organic growth, the forecast has now increased to a range of 2.5% to 5.5% or 4% at the midpoint. We have increased Aerospace organic growth to 9.5% at the midpoint. And for the Diversified Industrial segment, we have increased North America organic growth for the year to plus 2%. And for international, we still expect organic growth to be 1% at the midpoint.\nWe are raising adjusted segment operating margins. We're raising that 50 basis points to 27.0% for the year. That is now a forecasted increase of 90 basis points versus prior year, and incrementals are now forecasted to be approximately 40% for the full year.\nJust a few additional items. Corporate G&A is unchanged at $200 million. Interest expense has been increased by $30 million, we now expect $420 million for the full year. And that is driven solely by the funding of the Curtis acquisition. And other expenses just slightly up to $90 million from $80 million last quarter.\nOur full year tax rate, we expect 22.5%. And we are raising adjusted earnings per share to an even $30 at the midpoint. That would be a 10% increase versus prior year. The range on that EPS is plus or minus $0.40 on either side, and the split is 48-52 first half, second half.\nIn respect to full year free cash flow, we're also raising our guidance there to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, with conversion, like I said, greater than 100%.\nAnd finally, looking specifically at Q2 for FY '26, we expect organic growth to be -- or excuse me, reported sales are expected to be 6.5%. Organic growth is expected to be 4%. Adjusted segment operating margins, 26.6%. And EPS for the second quarter on an adjusted basis is $7.10. As usual, we have the -- some additional details in the appendix.\nAnd really just in summary, FY '26 is off to a great start. That gives us confidence to raise full year guidance for sales margin, EPS and free cash flow.\nWith that, I ask you to move to Slide 16, and Jenny, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. And a reminder on what drives Parker. Safety, engagement and ownership are the foundation of our culture. It's our people and living up to our purpose that drives top-quartile performance, that allows us to be great generators and deployers of cash. Thank you.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nAll right. Chloe, we are ready to begin the Q&A session. So we'll take the first question."

Welcome to the Parker Hannifin Corporation's Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd Leombruno, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you so much, [ Bob ]. I'd like to welcome everyone to Parker's fiscal year 2025 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Release Webcast. As [ Bo ] said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking, and with me today, as usual, is Jenny Parmentier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We appreciate your interest in Parker, and we thank everyone for joining us today.\nOn Slide 2, we address our disclosures on forward-looking projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Items listed here could cause actual results to vary from our forecast. Our press release, this presentation and reconciliations for all non-GAAP measures were released this morning and are available under the Investors section on [indiscernible]\nThe agenda for today has Jenny starting out with the highlights to our record fiscal year 2025 performance. She will then reiterate the strength of our transformed portfolio, the power of the Win Strategy, which is our business system, that drives performance in all economic climates, and then she'll provide some color on our recently announced acquisition of Curtis Instruments.\nI'm going to follow with a few details on our strong fourth quarter financial results. We did release our initial FY '26 guidance this morning, and we will discuss the assumptions, and provide some color on what we expect to be another record year for Parker. We'll conclude the call with a normal question-and-answer session, and we will do our best to take as many questions as possible.\nNow I would ask everyone to call your attention to Slide 3, and Jenny, the floor is yours.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. The Win Strategy and our culture of high performance delivered another record year. We had a 17% reduction in recordable incident rate, once again achieving top quartile safety performance and record engagement survey results. Top line sales finished at $19.9 billion, and this team achieved record adjusted segment operating margin of 26.1%, an increase of 120 basis points to prior year, and record adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.4%, an increase of 80 basis points to prior year. We generated record cash flow from operations of $3.8 billion and delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth. We finished the year with a record $11 billion in backlog, and we remain committed to a disciplined, active and balanced capital deployment strategy.\nNext slide, please. Another year of outstanding performance from Aerospace with record sales of $6.2 billion. That's 13% organic growth and 190 basis points of adjusted segment operating margin expansion. Orders continued to outpace sales growth as we finished the year at a record backlog of $7.4 billion. Today, we enjoy a balanced and diverse Aerospace portfolio. We finished FY '25 with 51% of our sales from serving the aftermarket, and 49% from serving our OEM customers.\nLooking back to FY '19. I'd like to recognize our Aerospace team for navigating and managing through numerous industry challenges, successfully integrating the Parker and [ Meggitt ] Aerospace businesses together, and staying focused every day on the safety of our team members and improving the experience for all of our customers. The performance is impressive. Sales are approximately 2.5x higher, and we are on track to expand adjusted segment operating margin by 940 basis points from fiscal year '19 through our fiscal year '26 guidance, and we're not done yet. Our comprehensive offering of proprietary designs on premier programs, and our global footprint that supports a diverse customer base, well positions us for sustained growth and operating performance.\nNext slide, please. The Industrial segment of our business has been a large part of our transformation and margin expansion story. Fiscal year '25 delivered record adjusted segment operating margin of 25.1%, a 90 basis point increase over prior year. Using the Win Strategy, our teams are on track to deliver 700 basis points margin expansion from fiscal year '19 through our FY '26 guide. This is a testament of our ability to expand margins through the cycle, even in periods of negative organic growth.\nOur powerhouse of interconnected technologies, global distribution network, and global manufacturing footprint, our competitive advantages that will drive growth from secular trends across the market verticals. Our portfolio today is well balanced. [ 2/3 ] is now longer cycle, secular trend and aftermarket. We are poised for a return to growth.\nNext slide, please. Once again, the transformation of our portfolio further expanded longer cycle and secular revenue mix in fiscal year '25. Acquisitions in both Aerospace and Industrial, along with international distribution growth, have greatly contributed to this transformation. We see this transformation continuing and expect 85% of our portfolio to be longer cycle, secular and aftermarket by fiscal year '29.\nNext slide, please. And on June 30, we announced our intent to acquire Curtis Instruments, further expanding our electrification offering and secular revenue mix. Curtis is the leader in low-voltage motor control solutions for zero emission and [ hybrid ] mobile equipment. This acquisition will add a complementary suite of control solutions to pair with Parker's electric motor and motion control portfolio. This will further enhance our capabilities for implant and off-highway applications.\nCurtis has a strong market position across diverse and growing end markets. These are markets that we know, customers we have relationships with, and products that will be a great addition to our portfolio. We expect to close by end of the calendar year, and we look forward to welcoming the Curtis team to Parker.\nNext slide please. And a reminder on why we win. First, the Win Strategy is our business system. We have a decentralized operating structure. 85 divisions run by general managers with full P&L responsibility, acting like owners close to their customers, and executing the Win strategy every day. We have innovative products that solve customer problems. 85% covered by intellectual property. Our application engineers provide the expertise that allows us to have a competitive advantage with our technologies to provide efficient solutions for our customers. And finally, our distribution network is the envy of the competition and the best in the world. It took us over 60 years to build it, and it is truly an extension of our engineering teams, providing solutions to small and mid-sized OEMs. These partners are experts at applying our interconnected technologies.\nI'll now turn it back over to Todd to go through our fiscal year 2025 highlights.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. FY '25 was really a strong year. I'm going to try and quickly wrap up FY '25 with the Q4 results, and I'm on Slide 10.\nFourth quarter was another record-setting quarter. In fact, every number on this page is once again a record. It was another quarter of continued margin expansion and a quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Really impressive considering that sales were up just 1% versus prior year. Organic growth was positive at 2%. That's the highest we've been all fiscal year. Currency did turn favorable at 1%, and the divestitures that we previously announced throughout the year were 2% unfavorable to total sales.\nAdjusted segment operating margin was 26.9%. That's up 160 basis points from prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%. That's an increase of 50 basis points from prior year. Adjusted net income was almost $1 billion, was $992 million in the quarter. That was an 18.9% return on sales. And adjusted earnings per share were up 14%, and they reached $7.69 per share.\nJust a fantastic quarter, really from all the businesses, resulting in the best performance that we've had this fiscal year for sales, for organic growth adjusted segment margins and for adjusted EPS. We'd really like to thank our global team for a strong finish to the fiscal year. We talk about this a lot internally, finishing strong and everyone certainly delivered.\nIf you could move to Slide 11. This just highlights the components in the year-over-year improvements and adjusted EPS, what I'm proud to say here is 60% of the improvement in EPS in the quarter came from strong operating execution. Segment operating income dollars are up $96 million, or 7%. That was $0.56 of our improvement. Income tax was a bit favorable in the quarter. That's $0.47 favorable. That was really a result of a few discrete tax benefits that [ were ] resolved in the quarter. Also, I'd just like to call attention that Q4 last year was our highest tax rate of the year. So comps [indiscernible] a little bit there.\nInterest expense continues to be favorable. That was $0.12 favorable. That's really just based on our efforts to pay down debt throughout the year and discretionary share repurchases drove a $0.09 favorable impact. You can see that share count par there. Corporate G&A and other were unfavorable, really combined $0.32. That's a combination of less favorable pension expense versus prior year, but really a result of foreign currency exchange volatility year-over-year. The EPS growth story has been really consistent throughout the year, just strong operating execution, very tight cost controls, driving margin expansion, and as Jenny mentioned, disciplined capital allocation. So just a great way to finish the year.\nIf we can go to Slide 12, this just details the performance across our businesses. First, I'll start with orders. Orders continue to be positive. It's plus 5% versus prior year. Aerospace strength continues to drive backlog higher. Jenny mentioned, that's a record. We did see gradual improvement in sales growth across our major market verticals. And once again, this quarter, every business delivered record segment operating margins. Very nice to see that. And I already mentioned it, but in total, we were up 160 basis points from prior year.\nLooking specifically in the North America businesses, sales were $2.1 billion. Organic growth was just down 1% versus prior, but we did continue to see a sequential improvement in organic growth. And quite honestly, that was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. We did see improvement across the market verticals in North America. So that was a positive, and distribution sentiment continues to be positive across the channel.\nAdjusted operating margins did increase 170 basis points to a record 26.7%, and that was just again driven by excellent, excellent operating execution cost controls and a little bit of favorable mix. Gradual improvement in distribution kept orders in North America positive at plus 2% versus prior year. And I just want to note that this is the third consecutive quarter of positive order growth for North America.\nMoving to the Diversified Industrial International businesses. Sales were up to $1.5 billion. That's up 4%. Organic growth was positive at [ 1% ]. It was really nice to see that turn positive. In Asia Pac, organic growth was plus 6%. In Latin America, it was plus 4%, while EMEA did improve, it did remain negative 3% from organic growth standpoint.\nOur international teams are really committed to using the tools of the Win Strategy to reduce cost, improve efficiency and drive margin expansion, no matter what's happening with the top line. And that resulted in adjusted operating margins achieving a record of 24.7%, which is an 80 basis point expansion from prior year.\nOn the order front. International orders were flat versus prior year, really against some tough comps. And just a reminder that orders in Q3 did benefit from a number of significant long-cycle orders that remain in the backlog.\nLastly, if I look at Aerospace Systems, the momentum continues in Aerospace. Sales were a record $1.7 billion. That's up 10% versus prior year. That did exceed our expectations for the quarter. Organic growth was most of that 9% of that growth is organic, really driven by strong -- strength in the aftermarket channels. Adjusted segment operating margins up huge 190 basis points versus prior, and reached a record 29%. And Aerospace orders continue to be positive at plus 12%. Really want to commend our aerospace team members for another outstanding quarter and a strong finish to a stellar year.\nAll right. On Slide 13, this is my last slide for the year. This is cash flow. We finished FY '25 by achieving record cash flow generation. Cash flow from operations is a record at $3.8 billion, that's 19% of sales. Free cash flow was also a record at $3.3 billion, or 16.8% of sales, with conversion at [ 109 ] after adjusting for some nonoperating items. Both CFOA and free cash flow increased by 12% versus prior year. And in addition, we did repurchase an additional $850 million in shares during the quarter, and that brought our year-to-date share repurchases amount to $1.6 billion.\nAnd that is a wrap on our record FY '25 performance. So I know everyone is interested in guidance. We'll move on to FY '26 guidance. And Jenny, I'm going to hand it back to you on Slide 15.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. This slide [indiscernible] sales growth forecast by key market verticals, so [indiscernible] growth. With higher growth in commercial OEM, we are forecasting low single-digit growth in-plant and industrial, and this is assuming a gradual industrial [indiscernible] our most challenged market this year, we are forecasting a mid-single-digit organic decline. In [ off-highway ], we are forecasting a low single-digit decline. The ag market has moved past trough but needs a little more time before returning to positive. Construction is stronger than ag with recovery under [ LOI ]. And we expect positive low single-digit growth in energy, as well as HVAC and Refrigeration.\nAt the midpoint, this results in 8% organic growth for Aerospace, approximately 1% organic growth for both Industrial North America and Industrial International, and approximately 3% total Parker organic growth.\nI'll give it back to Todd to go through more details of the guidance.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Jenny. I'm on Slide 16. We'll just go over a few items. Reported sales growth for the year is expected to be in the range of 2% to 5%. That's 3.5% at the midpoint. That will be approximately $20.6 billion in annual sales. And we have modeled those sales 48% in the first half, 52% in the second half. And consistent with our practice, this guidance does not include any impact from the Curtis Instruments acquisition. We will add Curtis to our guide once it closes.\nIf you look at organic growth, Jenny mentioned this, but the forecast is in the range of 1.5% to 4.5%, or 3% at the midpoint. Aerospace is again 8% at the midpoint and both North America and international, we expect 1%. Organic growth [ as ] modeled 2% first half, and 4% in second half. Currency, as usual is based on the June 30 spot rates, and based on our math here, it shows that, that's expected to be favorable by 1.5%, or roughly $260 million.\nOn margins, adjusted segment operating margin guidance is [ 26.5 ] at the midpoint. That is an increase of 40 basis points versus the FY '25 finish. And in respect to incrementals, we have modeled roughly 35% for the full year on incrementals.\nJust a few things to note. Below segment operating income. Corporate G&A is approximately $200 million. Interest expense, approximately $390 million. And other expenses, approximately $80 million. All of those are at the midpoint. Tax rate, we are modeling a 22.5% tax rate. As usual, we are not including any unknown discretes in that number. 22.5% is what we have modeled. And EPS for the full year is expected to be [ $28.90 ] on an adjusted basis at the midpoint. That is an increase of 6% versus prior year. We have a range of $0.50 on both sides of that $28.90. And the split on EPS is 46% first half, 54% second half.\nLastly with respect to cash flow. Full year free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, with conversion at approximately 100%. And lastly, on the far right column here, you could see what we have highlighted for Q1, FY '26. All of these numbers are at the midpoint. Reported sales are roughly 0.5% positive. Organic growth is 2% positive, and we are forecasting 26.1% for adjusted segment margins, and an adjusted EPS of $6.51.\nAs usual, we have some further details in the appendix if those are helpful for your model. Lastly on Slide 17, this is just a bridge, and I'll just highlight as we walk through this. We are forecasting a 5% increase in adjusted segment operating income dollars which translates to $1.68 in additional EPS. Share count, based off of that year-to-date repurchase amount is roughly $0.37 of improvement in EPS for FY '26. Corporate G&A are forecasted to be $0.18 favorable. And again, interest rate will give a little bit of a tailwind, $0.11 for the year. The forecasted tax rate of [ 22% ] is a headwind of $0.77 compared to our -- the effective tax rate that we realize. And once again, that does not include any discrete items. So in summary, we are guiding [indiscernible] and adjusted EPS, that is up 6%.\nAnd with that, I'm going to ask you to move to Slide 18. And Jenny, I will hand it back to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. So I'll close with a reminder on what drives Parker. And again, thank you to all the Parker team members for a fantastic fiscal year '25 and a very, very promising FY '26. Safety and engagement and ownership are the foundation of our culture. It's our people and our purpose that drives top quartile performance, and we remain committed to being great generators and deployers of cash.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay [ Bo ]. So, we are ready to start the Q&A session."

Welcome to Parker Hannifin Corporation Fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.\n[Audio Gap]\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nContinuous improvement and optimization of our resources, disciplined use of our 80/20 tools has made us successful in reducing revenue complexity, leveraging our distribution channel and rationalizing product allows us to serve our customers better. And our simple by design tools further reduce product and related manufacturing complexity that enables growth and efficiency in our operations. We are using all of these tools to expand margins no matter what phase of the business cycle we are in.\nNext slide, please. Supply chain leadership is a competitive differentiator for Parker. The addition of enhanced demand and capacity tools as well as dual sourcing strategies, has increased visibility and resilience, reduce lead times and improve the customer experience. We have always had a local-for-local model, driven by our desire to be close to our customers. This has also allowed us to leverage global capacity to better serve all of our customers. We have dealt with tariffs before and are extremely grateful for our excellent pricing and supply chain teams.\nTariffs are a lot of noise and work that our teams are leveraging analytics and robust processes to navigate and act quickly through these dynamic and challenging times. -- announced tariffs are approximately 3% of cost of goods sold were $375 million on an annualized basis, fully offset by mitigation actions and designed to protect earnings per share.\nI'll now turn it back over to Todd to review the third quarter highlights.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. I am on Slide 9, and I'm going to just run through the financial results very quickly. As Jay said, this was a strong quarter. record-setting quarter, in fact, it was another quarter of continued margin expansion and EPS growth. Sales were down 2% versus prior. Organic growth was positive at 1%. Currency remained unfavorable at negative $1, the main driver really of the overall decline is the result of those previously announced divestitures that we've made this year. That accounted for 2% of the decline, which is essentially the entire decline.\nAs Jenny mentioned, adjusted segment operating margins were up 160 basis points to 26.3%. That is a record, and adjusted EBITDA margins were up 150 basis points to 27 Obviously, the first time we've ever done that, that is a record. Net income is 904. That's 18.2% return on sales, both of those numbers are records. And adjusted earnings per share is up 7% to $694. Being able to grow earnings per share 7%, with the top line down 2% is just another indicator of just how different Parker is today. This was another quarter of strong performance that was consistent across all the businesses, each contributed to the margin expansion and cash flow performance that Jenny mentioned, and this performance that we had in Q3 continues to support the expectations we have for another record year.\nIf we go to the next slide, Slide 10. This just shows the walk of the $0.43 increase in adjusted earnings per share. Q3 really the same story that we had in the first half of the year. Unbelievably disciplined operating performance. Segment operating income dollars are up $53 million, that's $0.32 of the increase in earnings per share. Aerospace continues to be the primary driver of our segment operating margin dollar growth. But the industrial businesses also delivered record segment operating margin percentages despite the pressures on the top line in those businesses.\nInterest expense continues to be down. That is a $0.17 favorable result this year. That is really the result of our commitment to reducing debt. Corporate G&A is favorable $0.08, that really is related to lower market-based benefits and just great discretionary cost controls across the businesses. Other expense was a drag of $0.13 and that really is a combination of just less favorable pension expense versus prior year and obviously, some currency translation just based on FX rates and volatility.\nAnd then lastly, share count and income tax basically offset each other, and that's how we got to the $694 million adjusted EPS for the quarter. Really, I just want to commend our teams around the world for just great cost diligence and unbelievable operating performance that drove the strong results.\nOkay. If we go to 11, we'll just dive into the segments a little bit. Order trend continues to be positive for the company. Orders are plus 9% versus prior year. Really, this is driven by longer cycle strength, that continues to drive order rates and backlog higher. And once again, every business delivered record segment operating margins. The total company is up 160 basis points. Specifically in the diversified North American businesses, sales were $2 billion. Organic growth was down 3% versus prior. That did improve sequentially from Q2, but the result was lower than we expected going into the quarter.\nWe continue to see softness in the transportation, off-highway and energy markets. Distribution sentiment remains positive. But what's really nice here is adjusted segment operating margins are up 110 basis points to a record 25.2%, really just driven by great operating performance and like I said before, cost controls. Gradual improvement in distribution kept orders at North America positive at plus 3% versus prior, we were happy to see that. And this is the second quarter in a row of positive order entry results for North America.\nIf we look at the international businesses, order rates improved really to a double-digit positive 11 here. That is really driven by a nice recovery and the long-cycle exposure there. Sales were $1.4 billion. Organically, that was also down 3%. Asia Pacific, specifically was up 2%. Organically, Latin America continues to be very robust at plus 8%, while the EMEA region remains challenged at negative 7%.\nOur international teams really are remaining agile and focused on cost controls and reductions and really efficiency improvements. The evidence is clear in their margin performance. Adjusted segment operating margins here were 25.1% and expanded by 160 basis points versus prior year.\nAerospace continues to be the standout unbelievable and inspiring results here. Sales were a record $1.6 billion in Aerospace. That's up 12% and versus prior year. Once again, this quarter, they exceeded our expectations on the top line. All of that growth was organic. Organic growth was 12%, really continue to be driven by the aftermarket strength in both defense and commercial end markets. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for aerospace, just unbelievably stellar performance.\nMargins are up 200 basis points and reached a record $28.7 million. We are certainly pleased that Aerospace is now 1/3 of the company and aerospace orders continue to be positive at plus 4%.\nIf we go to the next slide, Slide 12, is just some comments on cash flow, strong cash flow performance from the corporation. Cash flow from operations on a year-to-date basis is 15.8%. And that equates to $2.3 billion. That is up 8% versus prior year, and the $2.3 billion is a year-to-date record -- year-to-date free cash flow was also up 8% versus prior. That's about $2 billion or 13.7% of sales. So just great cash flow performance across the company.\nYou may have noticed last Wednesday, our Board approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend as a result of their confidence in the company's ability to continue to generate strong cash flows, no matter what the business cycle brings us. And our dividend per share on a quarterly basis is now $1.80. The action will extend our record of increasing annual dividends paid per share to an amazing years.\nLastly, during the quarter, we purchased $600 million of shares in addition to the usual $50 million that we purchased as part of our 10b5-1 program, Total repurchases in the quarter equated to $650 million. And on a year-to-date basis, repurchases now total $750 million.\nSo moving on to guidance, let's move to Slide 14. Jenny, I'm going to hand it back to you to start with the update on market verticals.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. So taking a look at our FY '25 sales forecast by market vertical. For Aerospace and Defense, Todd just went over some strong results, we are raising full year organic growth to 12% and on continued aftermarket strength and gradual OEM recovery. Previous guidance was 11%. We are lowering implant and industrial equipment growth to be negative low single digits.\nNow this was previously slightly positive low single digits. But this lowering is due to a prolonged delay in industrial recovery. But it is worth noting that quoting activity remains strong despite the project delays that are being seen. We are lowering transportation growth to be negative low single digit. This was previously neutral. And this is primarily due to a lower automotive production forecast in North America and EMEA. Work truck demand does remain stronger than on-highway same as last quarter.\nOff-Highway improved slightly to negative low teens. This was previously negative mid-teens. OEM destocking and end market weakness does persist, but it is partially offset by stronger aftermarket. Ag weakness continues no real sign of recovery here yet. Lowered energy to negative low single digits as was previously neutral, and this is due to oil prices and a disciplined approach to capital spending.\nAnd we have increased HVAC and AR to high single digits. This was previously mid-single digits and driven primarily by strength in residential air conditioning.\nI'll hand it back to you, Todd, to go over the guidance update.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Jenny.\nMoving to Slide 15. I'm just going to go through some of the details for the guide. Reported sales growth for the year is now forecasted to be approximately minus 1%. In respect to organic growth, for the full year, we expect organic growth to be about positive one. We have raised aerospace organic growth to 12% for the year. But we've lowered industrial segment, the industrial segment in Industrial North America, organic growth is now forecasted to be approximately minus 4% and Industrial International organic growth is now forecasted to be approximately negative $2.5 million.\nThe previously announced divestitures on a full year basis will be negative 1.5%, 100% of those divestitures were reported within the Industrial North American businesses. And currency is now expected to be just a slight negative 0.5% headwind and those are based on March 31 exchange rates.\nIn respect to segment operating margins, we are raising guidance by 10 basis points for the full year. That will now be 25.9% segment operating margin, that forecast will be a full year margin expansion of 100 basis points versus prior year. And of course, that improvement is being contributed by all businesses. Assumptions for corporate G&A, interest and other. As usual, we provided those in the appendix. We expect full year tax rate to be $21.5 million.\nWhen you look at adjusted EPS, we now see the full year -- excuse me, as reported EPS, the full year is now $26.2 at the midpoint, and we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guide of $26.70 at the midpoint. On both of those numbers, there's a range of plus or minus $0.10 on both the as-reported and the adjusted figures.\nIn respect to tariffs, Jenny mentioned this earlier, but we expect to fully mitigate any additional costs associated with all the announced tariffs. Our EPS guidance does include costs and mitigation actions with all announced tariffs and those will be fully offset within the quarter. For Parker, on an annualized basis, we have targeted the announced tariff cost to be about $375 million, and that equates to roughly 3% of our cost of goods sold.\nWe foresee full year free cash flow to be $3.1 billion. And of course, free cash flow conversion is expected to be greater than 100%. For Q4, the last quarter of our fiscal year. More specifically, we expect reported sales to be $5.1 billion, organic growth of positive 1.5%, adjusted segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 26.1%.\nWe have modeled a tax rate of 22% for the quarter and adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.05. That also includes all announced tariffs and are mitigating actions. So that's it for the details on the guide.\nJenny, I'll hand it back to you and ask everyone to move to Slide 16.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. And just a final reminder on what drives Parker. I said it at the beginning of the presentation. Safety engagement and ownership are the foundation of our culture. It's our people and living up to our purpose that drives top quartile performance. And we remain committed to being great generators and deployers of cash. We are actively focused on extending our track record, deploying capital to deliver the best shareholder value possible. Back to you, Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Diego, we are ready to start the Q&A portion of the call. So we'll take whatever you have in queue."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Shane. We appreciate it so much. Welcome to Parker's Fiscal Year 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Release Webcast. This is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer, speaking. And with me today is Jenny Parmentier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We appreciate your interest in Parker, and thank you for joining us today.\nOn Slide 2, we will address our disclosures on forward-looking projections and all non-GAAP financial measures. Items listed here could cause actual results to vary from our forecast. Our press release, this presentation and all reconciliations for any non-GAAP measures were released this morning and are available under the Investors section on parker.com.\nThe agenda for the call today has Jenny starting with the highlights to our record second quarter performance. She will also highlight how our business system strategy drives operational excellence in Parker, and then she will give an update to our market vertical outlook for the rest of our fiscal year FY '25. I will follow Jenny with more details on our strong second quarter financial results and provide additional color to our updated guidance. We'll then conclude, as usual, with the question-and-answer portion of the call, and we will do our best to address as many questions as possible within the hour.\nNow I'd like to draw your attention to Slide #3. And Jenny, I will turn it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and thank you to everyone for attending the call today. Our performance this quarter reflects our focus on operational excellence and the strength of our balanced portfolio. We produced top-quartile safety performance, aligned with our goal to be the safest industrial company in the world and saw continued strength from our aerospace aftermarket.\nConsistent execution of The Win Strategy delivered 110 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in a Q2 record of 25.6% adjusted segment operating margin. In addition, our teams delivered record adjusted segment operating margin across all businesses as well as record earnings per share.\nRecord year-to-date cash flow from operations, coupled with proceeds from previously announced divestitures, allowed us to substantially reduce debt by $1.1 billion this quarter. And finally, we are encouraged to see industrial orders turn positive in our longer-cycle businesses.\nNext slide, please. It's our Win Strategy. I'm often asked, how do we continue to expand margins, and more importantly, can we continue to do so? I've talked about this several times in the past. It is our business system, The Win Strategy, that drives operational excellence. We trust the process. It is a proven strategy and it works. The next few slides will show you how our teams use The Win Strategy to drive performance over the cycle.\nNext slide, please. Embedded in The Win Strategy is the Parker Lean System. It is fundamental to our culture and drives continuous improvement at all 85 divisions. Within the same pillars as The Win Strategy are the critical tools used by all of our general managers and their teams to expand margins and drive organic growth. Disciplined execution of the Parker Lean System reduces variation and eliminates waste from the business. This system allows us to keep taking performance to the next level. And important to point out here is that we are never done improving our business.\nNext slide, please. On this slide, we have an example of how The Win Strategy drives performance through the cycle in one of our North American divisions. This is a division in our filtration group that has diverse exposure across industrial market verticals and a balanced OEM aftermarket mix. This is an engaged team that has utilized our high-performance team structure to execute strategy.\nLooking at the results on the far right-hand side of the page. They have achieved first quartile safety by bringing attention and ownership to concerns, tracking them to closure and scheduling audit follow-ups to ensure sustained results. They are utilizing the Parker Lean System, specifically Kaizen, to expand margins and achieve the FY '25 profitability goals for their division, even in a negative growth environment.\nIn addition, they have utilized the simplified design tools to reduce complexity and cost as well as increased dual sourcing to strengthen their supply chain. And finally, use of our zero-defect tools has resulted in a 52% reduction in rejected parts per million, thus providing their customers a better experience.\nNext slide, please. Parker is a transformed company today. The chart on the left side of this page shows the strength of our portfolio over the last 2.5 years. Order rates increased across all reported business in Q2, coming in at 5% for the quarter. Aerospace order strength continued in both aftermarket and OEM, and although we are seeing a continued delay in the expected industrial recovery, we are encouraged to see industrial orders turn positive in our longer-cycle businesses.\nNext slide, please. Taking a look at our updated FY '25 sales forecast by market vertical. We are raising aerospace and defense to 11% on the strength of the aftermarket and gradual OEM rate increases. On the industrial side of business, although orders have turned positive, there continues to be pressure in many of these markets. We are expecting implants and industrial equipment growth to be slightly lower within our low single-digit framework. We are continuing to see delays in recovery, while distribution sentiment does remain positive.\nWe are changing our forecast on transportation from low single-digit to neutral primarily driven by weakness in automotive and higher dealer inventories. The bright spot here is that work truck demand does remain strong. Off-highway stepped down to negative mid-teens as OEM destocking and production cuts continue and the weakness in ag persist. We expect energy markets to remain neutral as projects and CapEx delays continue. And finally, we are increasing HVAC from low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth driven by refrigerated changes in the industry. All of this adds up to an organic growth forecast of approximately 2% for full year '25.\nI will now turn it over to Todd to summarize our Q2 results.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Jenny. Okay, everyone, I'm going to begin with results on Slide 10, and then we'll get to some more details on the outlook that Jenny just touched on. As Jenny mentioned, the second quarter was a strong quarter, lots of records. It was another quarter of strong margin expansion and EPS growth despite some real top line pressure. Sales were down 1.6% versus prior. Most of that decline is the result of the divestitures that we announced. The divestiture impact in the quarter was an unfavorable 1.4%.\nCurrency also flipped on us this quarter. While we were forecasting a slight positive 90 days ago, it turned out to be unfavorable at 0.9. And on a good note, organic growth was positive at almost 1%. If you look at segment operating margins, 25.6% is a Q2 record. That's an increase of 110 basis points versus prior year. And adjusted EBITDA was also a record at 26.8. Happens to also be an increase of 110 basis points from prior year. Adjusted net income of $853 million or 18% return on sales, both of those are also records. And lastly, adjusted earnings per share were up 6% to a Q2 record of $6.53.\nJenny mentioned this also, but the strong second quarter performance was consistent across all of our businesses and really just a nice solid finish to the first half of our fiscal year.\nIf we can move to Slide 11, this shows the walk for that $0.38 or 6% increase in adjusted EPS. And again, it was just a nice high-quality quarter. From an operating standpoint, segment operating income dollars did increase by $33 million or $0.20 despite the 1.6% lower top line. And while strong aerospace performance was the primary driver, the industrial business has delivered segment operating margins despite negative organic growth pressure and FX pressures as well. In total, interest expense was $0.17 favorable. That was driven by our continued focus on debt reduction.\nIncome tax and other both contributed $0.03, which was mostly offset by a slightly higher corporate admin and share count. So the adjusted EPS of $6.53. I already said it, it's a record. And I really commend our team members around the world for strong operating performance, really diligent cost actions where necessary and really a focus on cash flow that helped us achieve these results.\nIf we move into the segments, if I look on Slide 12, it really is a testament to The Win Strategy that our team members were able to deliver such broad-based margin expansion. We're so proud of the hard work and all of their efforts. Every business delivered record segment operating margins, whether they had a positive 14% organic growth or whether they were negative 5%. Margin expansion for the entire company was 110 basis points. And another positive sign was that orders moved to plus 5% versus prior year, mainly off of a longer-cycle end-market strength.\nIf you look at the Diversified Industrial North America business, sales were $1.9 billion. That equated to an organic growth of negative 5% versus prior. That was lower than our expectations going into the quarter. We continue to see delays in the industrial recovery, specifically in transportation and off-highway markets. Our recovery has also yet to materialize in the distribution channel. But if you look at adjusted segment operating margins, we were able to increase those by 40 basis points to a record 24.6% driven just unbelievable operating execution.\nA positive sign in North America were orders did turn positive after a few quarters of negative. So we're happy to see that. And again, it's specifically driven by some of our longer-cycle verticals.\nIf we move to the Industrial International businesses, sales were $1.3 billion. Organic growth in international came in negative 3%. Asia Pac was a positive 3%. That's similar to what we had last quarter. Latin America, positive at plus 10%, while EMEA remains challenged with organic growth at negative 8%. But if you look at adjusted segment operating margins, the international team achieved a record high of 24.1% and expanded margins by 110 basis points. As Jenny mentioned, it's really just the power of The Win Strategy in action.\nOur international team continues to focus on productivity, cost controls, all things in The Win Strategy to expand margins and really are operating with unbelievable resiliency in a very tough growth environment. Order rates here also moved further positive from plus 1% last quarter to plus 4%, and that was mainly driven by improvement out of Asia Pacific.\nIf we look at aerospace, aerospace continues to outperform. Sales were a record $1.5 billion in aerospace that is up 14% versus prior year. That did exceed our expectations for the quarter. All of that growth was organic, 14% organic growth, and that was really driven by a 20%-plus growth in the aftermarket area and mid-single-digit positive growth in the OEM markets.\nAdjusted segment operating margin, same story here, a record [ 28.2% ]. That is an increase of an incredible 170 basis points versus prior. Just really robust top line, favorable aftermarket mix continues to drive this great margin performance, and aerospace orders continue at a positive clip of plus 9%. So just great job across all of our businesses in the quarter.\nOn Slide 13, just to touch on our year-to-date cash flow performance. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was 17.4% of sales. That equates to about $1.7 billion in CFOA. That is a record, and it's also an increase of 24% versus prior year. Year-to-date free cash flow increased 17% from prior year. We finished at $1.5 billion or 15.2% of sales for free cash flow.\nJenny mentioned some of that divestiture activity. Divestiture activity in the quarter generated cash proceeds of approximately $620 million and in as reported, post-tax gain of $223 million. We have excluded that gain from our adjusted results in the quarter. And 100% of the proceeds from those transactions were used to further reduce debt. Jenny mentioned in the quarter, we paid down $1.1 billion. That moves our year-to-date debt reduction to $1.5 billion, and our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 1.7. So good work on cash flow across all elements of the business.\nOkay. Moving to Slide 14 and guidance. Let me give you some more details on this. Reported sales growth for the year is now forecasted to be in the range of minus 2% to positive 1% with 0.5% negative at the midpoint. Keep in mind, divestitures are 1.5% of that unfavorable impact, and 100% of that divestiture activity is from the Industrial North America businesses.\nCurrency headwinds are now expected to be a 1% negative headwind. That is based on December 31 exchange rates, as we always do. That did flip from what we were expecting 90 days ago, just currency rates continue to show significant volatility.\nIn respect to organic growth, we have raised the aerospace organic growth midpoint by 100 basis points to now 11% for the full year. But the offset is on industrial segment. Midpoint has been decreased as followed. In Industrial North America, organic growth is now forecasted to be negative 2.5% at the midpoint for the year. And the midpoint of the Industrial International organic growth is now forecast to be flat.\nFor the full year, we expect Parker's organic growth to be a positive 2% at the midpoint. Despite all of that, we are raising our adjusted segment operating margin guidance by an additional 10 basis points for the full year and moving our expectations to 25.8% for the year. That is now a forecasted margin expansion of 90 basis points versus our FY -- fiscal year finish of last year.\nTax rate is now slightly down to approximately 22%. We are modeling 22.5% for the second half of the year. And that -- there's more details of that in the appendix, along with assumptions we're using for corporate interest and other, as we usually provide those.\nDespite the currency headwinds and the delayed industrial recovery that Jenny talked to, we're maintaining our full year adjusted EPS midpoint at $26.70. Full year as reported EPS is now expected to be $24.76. And like I just said, adjusted EPS midpoint is expected to be $26.70. Both of those have a range of plus or minus $0.30 on either side.\nWe also remain committed to our free cash flow forecast in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion for the full year. If we look specifically at third quarter for FY '25, reported sales are expected to be approximately $4.9 billion with organic growth of positive 1.5%. Adjusted segment operating margin is 25.6%, and adjusted EPS for the quarter is expected to be $6.65.\nSo Jenny, that's all I have. I will hand it back to you, and I'll drive everyone's attention to Slide 15.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. And a reminder on what drives Parker: safety, engagement and ownership are the foundation of our culture. It's our people and living up to our purpose that drives top-quartile performance, and we remain committed to being great generators and deployers of cash. Todd just showed you our cash generation year-to-date, and we talked about all the great performance across all of the divisions. We are actively focused in extending our track record of deploying capital to deliver the best shareholder value possible.\nBack to you, Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nShimla, we are ready to begin the Q&A session. So we'll take whoever you got first in the queue."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good day, everyone. Welcome to Parker's fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter and year-end earnings release webcast. As Kevin said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. And with me today is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jenny Parmentier. We appreciate your interest in Parker, and we thank you all for joining us today.\nIf I could draw your attention to Slide 2, you will find our disclosures on our forward-looking projections on non-GAAP financial measures. Actual results could vary from our forecast based on the items we have listed here. Our press release, the presentation we're going to go through today and reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures were released this morning and are available under the Investors section on our website at parker.com.\nWe're going to start the call today with Jenny summarizing our record fiscal year 2024, that was really driven by our portfolio transformation and really some exceptional strength in our aerospace businesses. She'll also touch on our great future and what really is driving the company today. I'm going to follow Jenny with some more details on specifically the strong fourth quarter we just posted.\nAnd then both of us are going to provide some color on the fiscal year 2025 guide that we released this morning that sets us off on our journey to achieve our FY '29 targets. After those remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A session. We'll try to take as many questions as possible within the 1-hour time slot.\nAnd with that, Jenny, I'm going to hand it over to you and ask everyone to reference Slide 3.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Parker delivered an outstanding year in fiscal 2024 on the dedication of our people, the strength and balance of our portfolio and the value of our business system The Win Strategy.\nWe met or exceeded many of our commitments for FY '24. We produced top quartile safety performance, aligned with our goal to be the safest industrial company in the world. The strength of our portfolio was highlighted by a stellar year delivered by our Aerospace Systems segment. On low single-digit sales growth, the team delivered 200 basis points of margin expansion.\nOur earnings per share grew 18% on top of earnings growth of 15% in fiscal year 2023. And we generated record free cash flow of $3 billion.\nParker has a very promising future ahead as you'll see from our strong fiscal year '25 guide and the targets we have set for fiscal year 2029.\nNext slide, please. And it was a record year for aerospace, our first full year with Meggitt, achieving over $5 billion in sales, more than 2x the sales of fiscal year '20. All market segments delivered double-digit sales growth, and the strength continues as we look ahead. We are positioned for growth with significant content on leading programs, and our extensive portfolio will continue to create value for our customers, as well as our large installed base will drive continued aftermarket growth.\nNext slide, please. As illustrated on this slide, the transformation of our portfolio further expanded longer cycle and secular revenue mix in fiscal year '24. And although aerospace is a big part of the transformation, it's not the whole story. The acquisitions of CLARCOR and Lord and our on-purpose strategy to expand distribution in Europe and Asia have greatly contributed to the longer cycle, secular and industrial aftermarket mix. We see this transformation continuing and expect 85% of our portfolio to be longer cycle, secular and aftermarket, by fiscal year '29.\nEarly last week, we announced that we have signed an agreement to divest the North American composites business that came with the Meggitt acquisition. As mentioned during our Investor Day, we continue to optimize our portfolio. Our best owner playbook identifies businesses that find greater value with a different owner. Through this process, we determined that this business is not aligned with our core products, and we are not the best owner. It's a great team, and we are confident that they will be successful in the future.\nNext slide, please. These are the 4 key messages we presented at our Investor Day in May. We are positioned for growth with our interconnected technologies and the secular trends. We have demonstrated The Win Strategy, our business system, is compounding our performance and driving us to top quartile.\nAberrational excellence, years of driving a continuous improvement culture through our lean tools, creates growth and expand margins. And we have confidence in achieving the fiscal year '29 targets launched at our Investor Day in May.\nNext slide, please. And as a reminder, of what drives Parker. Safety, engagement and ownership are the foundation of our culture. It's our people and living up to our purpose that drives top quartile performance, allowing us to be great generators and deployers of cash.\nI'll turn it back to Todd to review our outstanding fourth quarter results.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. It really was a fantastic year for the company. On Slide 9, I just would like to take some time to talk about the fourth quarter.\nQ4 was an exceptionally strong quarter for the company. Once again, every number in this gold box on this page is a Q4 record. They also happen to be the highest levels of performance that we experienced this fiscal year.\nTotal sales growth was up nearly 2% from prior year. We reached almost $5.2 billion in sales in the quarter. Organic sales were positive at roughly 3%. That was a little bit better than what we were expecting with our guidance. The divestitures were just very slight unfavorable impact, and currency really turned into another headwind of almost 1% unfavorable currency.\nIf you look at adjusted segment operating margins, Jenny mentioned this, but we did improve them 130 basis points from prior year. And for the first time in the history of the company, we generated 25.3% segment operating margins for a quarter.\nSame story with EBITDA margins. The increase was a little bit greater, 190 basis points. For the quarter, we did 26.3% adjusted EBITDA margins. You look at adjusted net income, $884 million of adjusted net income. That is up 12% from prior year, and that is a 17.0% return on sales.\nEarnings per share, Jenny mentioned this as well, $6.77. That was up $0.69, or $0.11 from prior year. And it was just really an exceptionally strong quarter. It was a great way to finish the fiscal year, really driven universally across the globe by our engaged team members. And it was really just a nice way to finish the year. And it's another data point on Parker being able to deliver on our commitments.\nIf we jump to Slide 10, this is just a bridge on that 11% improvement in adjusted earnings per share. Again, the story is very similar to what we saw all year. Strong operating execution continues to drive earnings per share growth. If you look at segment operating income dollars, we increased by $90 million or 7%. That's basically $0.54 or 80% of the EPS growth quarter-over-quarter.\nAnd we've talked a lot about this already, but the Aerospace Systems segment once again is really responsible for over 90% of the earnings per share growth when it comes to segment operating income. The Diversified Industrial North American businesses made up the rest.\nIf you look at some of the below segment operating income line, corporate G&A was $0.16 favorable in the quarter. That really, again, was a result of some favorable items from the prior year, just not repeating. Interest expense, favorable again, $0.17 versus prior year. That really is the result of our successful deleveraging efforts that we've been working hard on all year.\nTax was unfavorable $0.12 against the prior year, and that was really just from slightly higher operating tax rate and, of course, the higher EBIT. And then other expense and share count were just both a bit higher than last year, but really the story here has been consistent throughout the whole year: strong operating execution, driving margin expansion, really keeping an eye on cost controls and being disciplined with our debt paydown. Just a nice way to finish the year.\nIf we jump to Slide 11, let's look at the segment performance. You could see, again, margin expansion across every business here. Really proud to see that. Incrementals for the company and really every part of the business were incredibly strong. Order rates inflected positive. It's 1%, that's positive. We're really happy to see that.\nAnd our backlog remained at near-record levels. We have $10.9 billion in shippable backlog. So that was a nice way to finish the year.\nLet's look at the Diversified Industrial segment. Specifically in North America, sales volume really remained strong, $2.2 billion in sales. Organic growth was negative 3%, but that was a full point better than our expectations. Softness in North America continues to be driven by off-highway markets and transportation markets.\nBut despite those lower volumes, we were able to increase adjusted segment operating margins by 150 basis points, and the North American businesses achieved 2.0. That is a record. It is all driven by operational execution, executing The Win Strategy and really working hard to deliver for our customers.\nOrder rates in North America also did improve to flat. That ends our negative string of year-over-year order declines, and we were really happy to see that.\nIf you look at the International businesses, sales were slightly over $1.4 billion. Organic growth was down 2.5% the prior year. But again, that was also better than our forecast. Off-highway markets continued to be soft.\nAnd if you look really across the regions, in Europe, we were negative 5%; in Asia Pac, negative 1%, which did slightly improve from Q3; and Latin America just continues to be robust at 19% organic growth.\nSame story on the margins. Margins increased 60 basis points in the quarter. Our International businesses generated 23.9% segment operating margins, and really just continue to be focused on simplification, productivity improvements. And I'm really happy to see this in the continued margin expansion from those International businesses.\nOrder rates in International finished at minus 1%, with positive order rates in Asia driving the majority of the improvement. So nice to see that to improve from Q3 as well.\nBut if we look at Aerospace Systems, right, that business continues to shine. Sales reached a record $1.5 billion in Aerospace. First time we've had $1.5 billion of sales in our Aerospace business. Organic growth, 19%, with double-digit growth across all of the platforms within Aerospace.\nOperating margins, a brand-new record, increasing 130 basis points to 27.1%. And it really is driven by great volumes and unbelievable strength in the aftermarket businesses.\nAerospace orders still remained strong. We did get the highest dollar level of orders for the year, and order rates continued to grow at plus 7%. So all things are looking up in Aerospace.\nMoving to the next slide, Slide 12, I just want to highlight our cash flow performance for the year. We finished FY '24 with record cash flow performance. CFOA increased 14% to a record of $3.4 billion. That's 17% of sales. Free cash flow, nearly $3 billion. That's also a record. That was 15% of sales. It's also a 15% increase from prior year. And we did achieve a conversion of 105%.\nI really just want to thank our team. This has been a lot of effort by a lot of people across the company. Really made some nice improvements in working capital. Really nice efforts on AP and AR. But I really want to note, this year, we were able to reduce inventory by over $120 million, really showcasing the efforts and the focus that we've had on supply chain excellence. Across the globe, we continue to focus on being great generators and great deployers of cash.\nIf we jump to Slide 13, you can see what we did with all that cash. We reduced debt by over $800 million in the quarter -- $800 million in the quarter alone. And since closing Meggitt, we have now reduced debt by over $3.4 billion. We had a target to reduce debt by $2 billion in the fiscal year. We hit that target. And if you look at our leverage ratios, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.1x and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.0. So it's exactly what we had forecast, and it really wraps up just a solid Q4 and a great fiscal year.\nSo with that, I'm going to hand it back to Jenny, and I'm going to get to what I know everyone is focused on, and that is our outlook for FY '25.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. At our Investor Day in May, we introduced the 6 key market verticals of our business that you see on this slide. This slide represents our FY '25 sales growth forecast for each market vertical, resulting in organic growth of 2% to 5%.\nWe are providing a realistic guide for fiscal year '25. At the midpoint of this guide, we have Aerospace at 8.5%, Industrial North America at 2%, and Industrial International at 1.5%. We are confident in growing EPS, achieving Meggitt synergies, and continuing our track record of expanding margins.\nI'll give it back to Todd to review the guide in a little more detail.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Jenny. So I'm now on Slide 16, and let me share some of the details of the FY '25 guide.\nReported sales is forecasted to be in the range of 1.5% to 4.5% or 3% at the midpoint. That will equate to approximately $20.5 billion in sales. That is really supported by outside support in our Aerospace businesses. Total sales for the company are modeled at 48% in the first half and then 52% and in the second half, so right in line with what we've historically done on sales splits.\nIf you look specifically at organic growth, we are forecasting organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%, or 3.5% at the midpoint. And we're expecting high single-digit growth from Aerospace, roughly 8.5%, and a gradual recovery in the Industrial markets throughout FY '25. For the North American businesses, we are forecasting organic growth of 2% at the midpoint. And for the International businesses, we are forecasting growth of 1.5% organic at the midpoint for the full year.\nIf you look at the mix on organic growth, it's 2.5% first half, 4.5% growth second half. And I will note that this guidance does include sales from the recently announced divestiture that Jenny mentioned. We are expecting that to close some time in the second quarter, and we will give an update once that closes to the impact it has on the company.\nWe are, based on June 30 currency spot rates, and we're forecasting that to be a slight headwind of about 0.5% or $100 million on currency versus prior year. Jenny mentioned margin expansion, 50 basis points of margin expansion is our plan. And in FY '25, we're going to get that by continuing to do exactly what we've done over the last couple of years that's really implement and advance The Win Strategy.\nAdjusted segment operating margin guidance is 25.4% at the midpoint. There is a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And segment operating income is split 47% first half, 53% second half. If you do the math on incrementals, we're expecting slightly at 40% incremental margins. That's a little bit higher than what we normally have had just based on the growth in Aerospace and, of course, continued Meggitt synergies.\nA few additional items on the guide. Corporate G&A is expected to be approximately $230 million. Interest expense is $450 million. That is a reduction of approximately $50 million from FY '24. And other expense is expected to be about $5 million.\nTax rate, we are modeling a 23% tax rate. And full year as-reported EPS of $23 or adjusted EPS of $26.65. Both of those figures are at the midpoint. And the range on those -- both of those ranges is $0.35 on the high end and the low end.\nAnd if you look at adjusted EPS, it is split 47% first half, 53% in the second half.\nIn respect to cash flow, for the full year, we are giving a range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is $3.15 billion at the midpoint. That will be approximately 15.3% of sales. And of course, we expect free cash flow conversion to be greater than 100%.\nIf you look at the far right column on this page, you'll see some specifics, specifically about Q1. And these are all at the midpoint. Reported sales, we are forecasting to be plus 1%. Organic growth is 1.5% positive. Adjusted segment margins of 25.2%. And adjusted EPS is expected to be $6.05. As usual, we've provided several other details for guidance in the appendix.\nIf you look at Slide 17, this is a very similar story to what we just did in FY '24. Segment operating income is the main driver of our EPS growth, that is $1.51 of EPS growth. We'll continue to have lower interest expense as a result of our great cash flow generation and our deleveraging efforts. That will add $0.34 to EPS.\nIf you look at the tax rate, that will be an unfavorable number. Just a reminder that that will be a 23% model tax rate. That is a headwind of $0.41, really compared to a favorable rate that we had in the full year of FY '24.\nCorporate G&A is slightly unfavorable, just $0.06. Other expense is $0.10 unfavorable, and share count is just another headwind of $0.07. But if you look at that all in, that's our walk to the $26 65 midpoint or 5% increase year-over-year.\nWith that, Jenny, I'm going to hand it back to you and ask everyone to reference Slide 18.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. As mentioned at our Investor Day and demonstrated in our results, this is a different Parker. We will add more than $10 to EPS and generate an additional 50% free cash flow by fiscal year '29. Our performance will continue to be accelerated from The Win strategy. We have a longer cycle and more resilient portfolio. We will experience growth from secular trends. And we will continue to be great generators and deployers of cash.\nNext slide, please. We are very proud to be celebrating 60 years on the New York Stock Exchange and will ring the closing bell next week, on Wednesday, August 14.\nI'll turn it back to Todd to get us started with Q&A.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nYes. Okay. Kevin, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A, and we'll take the first one in the queue. ."

Welcome to Parker-Hannifin Corporation's Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease note that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Leombruno, you may now begin your presentation.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob, and good day, everyone. As Rob said, this is Parker's fiscal year 2024 third quarter earnings release webcast. This is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. With me on the call today is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jenny Parmentier. We appreciate your interest in Parker, and we thank you for joining us today. .\nIf we move to Slide 2, you will find our disclosures on our forward-looking projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Actual results could vary from our forecast based on the items listed here. The press release, this presentation and reconciliations for all non-GAAP measures that we will discuss today were released this morning and are available under the Investors section on parker.com. We're going to start today with Jenny reviewing the highlights of our strong third quarter performance, and then she's going to highlight how the competitive advantage of our high-performance culture is getting our global team members to deliver consistent margin expansion.\nI will follow up then with some color on the financial results of the quarter, and I will provide some assumptions to our increase in the fiscal year '24 guidance. We're going to end the call with a Q&A session, and we'll try to take as many questions as we possibly can. Just a reminder, please try to limit your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed, so we can get to all of those in the queue. With that, I now draw your attention to Slide 3, and Jenny, I will hand it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Q3 was another quarter where the team delivered outstanding results executing the Win Strategy. Starting with safety, a 17% reduction in recordable incidents over prior Q3. Safety has been and will remain our top priority. Record sales of $5.1 billion in the quarter, with organic growth of 1.2%, record adjusted segment operating margin of 24.7%, that's a 150 basis point improvement over prior year with all segments expanding margins.\nAdjusted EPS growth of 10%, along with 12.6% year-to-date free cash flow margin. Aerospace demand remains robust and was again a significant driver of our performance in the quarter. Our transformed portfolio and strong performance are driving an increase to full year guidance. Next slide, please. Those of you who know us well know, this is the Win Strategy. This is our business system focused on the fundamentals. It is a proven strategy. We trust the process, and this is how we deliver results. Very simply put, this strategy works. I first used the Win Strategy when I joined Parker 16 years ago as a plant manager. I very quickly learned that it wasn't just words written on a piece of paper. I was trusted, empowered and expected to use the tools in the Win Strategy to improve my plan.\nI've since [indiscernible] as a General Manager, Group President and as an Executive Officer of the company. Based on a solid foundation of culture and values, we pursue 4 goals: engage people, customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. Engage people is the first and most important pillar. As I mentioned on the previous slide, safety is our top priority, and it sits in the first position of this first pillar.\nOne of the keys to our success is our decentralized operating structure. High performance teams at our 85 operating division utilize all the tools in the Win Strategy to deliver results. Our culture drives an ownership and entrepreneurial mindset, one that I appreciate it as a General Manager and respect today. We are excited to show you some examples of the Win Strategy in action at our upcoming Investor Day on May 16.\nNext slide, please. Embedded in the Win Strategy is our high-performance culture. This is a competitive advantage that has allowed us to build a better and more resilient Parker. The structure of high-performance teams increases engagement and commitment at all levels of the organization. This, coupled with a disciplined operating cadence drives top quartile performance. Our approach is strength based, focused on building relationships and team member development. This structure reinforces our customer centric mindset and drive continuous improvement across the enterprise.\nNext slide, please. Our people, our high-performance culture that I just spoke about, our strategy, the Win Strategy and our transformed portfolio have driven the performance you see on this page. This is a snapshot from FY '19 through our FY '24 guidance, 7% revenue CAGR from $14.3 billion to our FY '24 guide of $19.8 billion. 600 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin from 18.6% to our guide of 24.6%, 14% adjusted EPS CAGR and from $13.10 to our FY '24 guidance of $24.75 and 2x the amount of free cash flow dollars, $1.5 billion in fiscal year '19 and to our FY '24 guide of $3 billion. A lot of hard work. We are very proud of the global team delivering these results, and we have a very promising future ahead of us. And we're not done. I'll hand it over to Todd for the summary of our third quarter highlights.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. It's great to see those results. Let's take a look at the quarter. This is just a high-level financial summary for the company. As Jenny said, Q3 was another strong quarter for Parker. Once again, every number in that gold highlighted box is a Q3 record for the company. If you'll see total sales, we did grow -- it's up slightly from prior year. We reached $5.1 billion in sales. Organic growth was just over 1% positive, slight negative impact from divestitures. That's just 0.3%.\nOur sales and currency did shift to a slight headwind this quarter, not terrible at 0.6%, but it's the first time the sheer currency has been a headwind. If you look at the adjusted segment operating margins, that's an improvement of 150 basis points versus prior year. We did finish at 24.7%. And a similar story on EBITDA margins. We finished at 25.5%. That is an increase of 130 basis points from prior year. Moving to adjusted net income. We generated $851 million of net income. That is an ROS of 16.8%. And adjusted earnings per share were $6.51, and that's a $0.58 or 10% increase from prior year.\nNet income is also an increase of 10% from prior year. Q3 was really just a solid quarter when you look at the sales, when you look at segment operating income, when you look at net income and earnings per share, each one of those generated the highest levels that we produced this fiscal year. So a very strong quarter.\nIf we can move to Slide 9. This just shows the walk of that $0.58 or 10% increase in adjusted EPS. I'm really glad to say again, the main driver of segment operating income dollars increasing. We increased by $76 million in the quarter. That accounted for $0.45 of the EPS growth. That's nearly 80% of the EPS growth in the quarter. Again, Jenny mentioned this, but it's just impressive operating performance across the company, but specifically, the strength in our Aerospace Systems segment was again a main contributor this quarter.\nInterest expense is again favorable. That really is the result of our successful efforts to deleverage after the [indiscernible] transaction. Tax was favorable $0.06 versus prior year. Simply, that's just a few discretes that are certainly hard to predict. Corporate G&A was higher from prior year, but really, that's just more a result of prior year favorable items not repeating this fiscal year and you can see other expense and share count were just a little bit higher than prior year. So the theme really remains the same this quarter as it has in the first half of the year. Our team members are generating strong operating performance that is driving margin expansion, really in a tepid top line industrial environment.\nAnd our debt paydown efforts are really reducing our interest cost. So it's just great to see the team work together to generate those results. If we go to Slide 10, this is the segment performance. You can see we continue to see positive growth as a result of the higher concentration of aerospace in our portfolio. Margin expansion does continue across all of our businesses. That is great to see. Order dollars did remain strong against a very tough comp in the prior year. Order dollars did improve sequentially from last quarter. So we're happy to see that.\nIf you look at the North American businesses, sales volume reached $2.2 billion. Organic growth was down 4.6%, as you can see on the slide, but that was in line with our expectations. It was driven by softness in off-highway and transportation markets specifically. We did continue to see destocking throughout the quarter, but I will say it did continue at a decelerating rate. Despite the down volume, margins increased 120 basis points to a third quarter record of 24.1% in the North American business. This just really is a shining example of operation excellence and how the teams continue to see opportunities to drive margins even higher.\nOrder rates in North America did remain constant with last quarter. They finished at minus 4 in the quarter. If we move to the international businesses, you can see sales volume reached $1.4 billion. Organic growth was down 3.1% on those businesses. But again, that was in line with our guidance. If you look at EMEA, that was the most negative at negative 5.1 and just some contraction again in highway transportation and implant industrial markets. Asia Pac growth was minus 2.8%. China remains generally soft.\nLatin America is a strong point. They continue to be positive at 19% versus prior year. What we're really proud about is the team, even on that lower volume, expanded margins by 10 basis points, and they also generated a third quarter record of 23.5%. Focus remains on productivity improvements and cost controls in these businesses with orders in the international businesses at minus 8. In EMEA, we are seeing some choppiness on orders, while Asia Pac we are seeing some improvements. If we look at aerospace, aerospace delivered another stellar quarter for the company. Sales reached a record of $1.4 billion, that's the highest we've ever had in the aerospace business. Organic growth was 18% across every market segment we have in aerospace.\nThis is the fifth quarter of double-digit organic growth within Aerospace. Aftermarket strength continues to be outstanding. This quarter, we were up 26% in the commercial aftermarket area and operating margins are fantastic, reaching a new record, increasing by 320 basis points versus prior year to come in at 26.7%. Demand just remains robust, aftermarket strength continues and the team is just doing great driving margins ever higher.\nOrder rates in aerospace continue to be very strong at plus 15. So just great performance across all of our businesses. If we go to Slide 11, let's talk about cash flow. So first of all, I think most of you have probably seen this last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend payout of $1.63 per share. That is a 10% increase over the prior dividend payout. With that increase, this does increase our annual record of paying higher dividend dollars per year from 67 years to now 68 years, just an unbelievably impressive record.\nLooking at cash flow. We've got a record on cash flow of $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations, that's 14.6% of sales. That is a 20% increase over prior year. And I said it already, but it is a record. When you look at free cash flow, we did $1.9 billion that is 12.6% to sales and that also is a 22% increase versus prior year. The team really remains focused on being great generators and great deployers of cash. We are reaffirming our full year target of free cash flow dollars of over $3 billion, and we certainly are committed to free cash flow conversion of over 100 for the full fiscal year. So great performance on cash.\nLet's move to Slide 12. I'm happy to give an update on our deleveraging progress. We did reduce debt by over $420 million in the quarter. Since we closed the Mega transaction, it was just 6 quarters ago. We have reduced debt by over $2.6 billion. That, coupled with the continued expansion in EBITDA growth, we have reduced our leverage by over 40% just since the close. Both of those are ahead of our original commitment. And you can see on the slide here, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.3x and net debt is down to 2.2x.\nWe still feel confident that we will get the $2 billion of debt paid down in this fiscal year and we certainly are on track to achieve net leverage of 2x by June of this fiscal year, just in 2 months. So if we go to Slide 13, just some color on our guidance. We are reaffirming our full year organic growth midpoint and increasing our margin and earnings per share expectations for the year. Our reported sales growth for the year is expected to be 4% at the midpoint. And on organic growth, we are increasing aerospace once again. We're increasing it by 300 basis points to 15% for the full year.\nBoth North America and international diversified industrial businesses. Organic growth is now forecasted to be negative 2.5%. But for the company, full year organic growth remains the same at 1.5% positive. So you can see how aerospace is helping the portfolio on our top line. We're raising adjusted segment operating margins. We're raising that to 24.6. That's 30 basis points higher than prior guidance, and that now forces the full year margin expansion to be approximately 170 basis points versus prior year.\nCorporate G&A and interest, unchanged from prior guide. Tax rate is down a little bit, just really based on Q3 actual results. We expect that to be 22% now. Full year as-reported EPS has increased to $20.90 and full year adjusted EPS has increased to $24.75. Both of those are at the midpoint and there's a range narrowed to plus or minus $0.10 for the fourth quarter. Finally, if you look at the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS is expected to be $6.13 at the midpoint. So as usual, we've got some more specifics in the appendix if needed. And now I'm going to hand it back to you, Jenny, and I ask everyone to turn to Slide 14.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. A few key messages to close this out as we near the end of our fiscal year '24. Our high-performance culture built a better and more resilient Parker. We will continue to drive operational excellence through the Win Strategy. As mentioned a couple of times already, aerospace demand remains robust, and our transformed portfolio drives growth. And finally, Parker is and will continue to be a great generator and deployer of cash. .\nNext slide, please. We are looking forward to sharing our story at our investor meeting on May 16. I will be joined by our President and Chief Operating Officer, Andy Ross, our Chief Financial Officer, Todd Leombruno, and our Vice President of Investor Relations, Jeff Miller. Our key themes for the meeting are transforming the company, how we are positioned for growth from secular trends, operational excellence and financial performance. Thank you again for joining the call today, and I'll turn it back over to Todd for Q&A.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nRob, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A, and we'll take whatever you got first in the queue."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Diego, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Parker Hannifin's fiscal year 2024 second quarter earnings release webcast. As Diego said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. And I'm here today with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jenny Parmentier. We know that this is an extremely busy day for everyone, and we appreciate you joining us, and we appreciate your interest in Parker.\nOn Slide 2, you'll see our disclosures addressing forward-looking projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Actual results could vary from our forecast based on the items listed here. Our press release, this presentation and reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures were released this morning and are available under the Investors section at parker.com.\nThe agenda for today is Jenny starting with the highlights of our record second quarter. She's also going to reinforce how our portfolio, our team members and the Win Strategy, our business system, are driving margin expansion and position Parker for a very bright future. I'm going to add some color on the financial results and a few details on the increase to our guidance that we released this morning. And after that, we're going to open up the lines, and Jenny and I will take any questions from those in the queue.\nI now ask you to move to Slide 3. And Jenny, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q2 was a quarter of exceptional results, excellent operating performance driven by all of our team members executing the Win Strategy.\nStarting with safety. A 16% reduction in recordable incidents over prior Q2. Safety has been and will remain our top priority.\nRecord sales of $4.8 billion in the quarter, a 3% increase over prior year, with organic growth of 3%. Record adjusted segment operating margin of 24.5%, a 300 basis point increase over prior year, with all segments expanding margins. And adjusted EPS growth of 29%, along with 11.9% year-to-date free cash flow margin.\nAerospace strength was a significant driver of our performance in the quarter. We now expect to achieve $200 million in cumulative synergies in fiscal year '24, a $50 million increase to our original guide for this fiscal year. We remain committed to achieving $300 million in synergies by fiscal year '26. And our backlog remains resilient at $10.8 billion. We had a strong finish to the first half and, as a result, are increasing fiscal year '24 guidance, Todd will go over this later in the slide deck.\nNext slide, please. I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting the power of the entire Parker portfolio. We have a technology powerhouse of interconnected solutions that delivers value for customers in both aerospace and industrial markets. Today, 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy 4 or more of the technologies you see across the top of this page. And 2/3 of our portfolio product solutions that we have today enables clean technologies.\nNext slide, please. Parker has significant content on leading aerospace programs. We have a comprehensive product offering with proprietary design on premier programs. On the upper left-hand side of this page is our first half sales mix by application. You see a nice balance of commercial and military, as well as business jets, regional transport and helicopters. This diverse aerospace and defense exposure allows us to have multiple products and technologies on every major aircraft program globally, many of them seen along the bottom of this page. All of this adds up to be a compelling value proposition for all of our aerospace customers.\nNext slide, please. And equally compelling is our global distribution network, a competitive differentiator for Parker. 50% of our diversified industrial revenue is through distribution, a high-margin channel serving aftermarket and small- to medium-sized OEMs. Our distribution partners integrate Parker technologies that solve customer problems. They are truly an extension of Parker's sales and engineering teams.\nBuilding on the success of the North American distribution channel, we continue to drive an increasing revenue mix of 100 basis points per year in international markets. This past December, we held our North America national sales meeting for the first time since the pandemic. Nearly 100 distribution partners attended the meeting, along with Parker divisions and sales teams. It was great to have everyone together again. And despite the destocking we've been talking about for several quarters, the overall sentiment and tone was very positive for the future.\nNext slide, please. We continue to be very proud of our margin expansion progress. Our people, our business system, the Win Strategy and our portfolio have truly transformed Parker's performance. The progress can be seen in every segment on this page. In addition to our core strategies on lean pricing and procurement, Win 3.0 initiatives like Simple by Design, our focus on demand forecasting, zero defects, and productivity and automation will take us to 25% adjusted operating margin and beyond. Every strategy and tool in the Win Strategy expands margins.\nI'll now turn it back to Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jenny. I'm going to start on Slide 9, and I'm just going to really quickly go through the FY '24 Q2 financial summary. As Jenny mentioned, the second quarter was an extremely strong quarter for us. It was a great finish to the first half of our fiscal year. And once again, the team set an unbelievable amount of records for the quarter.\nIf you look at this slide, every number in that gold column is a second quarter record. We set new highs for sales, segment operating margin, EBITDA margin, net income and earnings per share.\nTotal sales growth was plus 3% in the quarter. All of that 3% was organic. And just a reminder, this is the first full quarter that we have Meggitt booked current in prior year periods. The net impact of divestitures and currency basically offset each other. Divestitures were slightly unfavorable at 0.3, currency was slightly favorable at 0.5. When you look at the margins, Jenny already mentioned this, but 24.5% was an increase of 300 basis points versus prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margin reached 25.7. That was an increase of 330 basis points versus prior year.\nIf you take a look at net income, we did $802 million on an adjusted basis. That is a 16.6% return on sales. That was a 30% increase versus prior year. And lastly, adjusted earnings per share, a record for the quarter, $6.15. That was up 29% from prior.\nJust an exceptional second quarter. And again, unbelievable margin expansion. And what I really like about it, it was very consistent across all of our businesses, as Jenny just shared on that last slide.\nIf you go to Slide 10, this is the earnings per share bridge. And this chart really shows what a high-quality quarter it was for the company.\nThe 29% in adjusted earnings per share, that amounted to an additional $1.39 of earnings per share in the quarter. The main driver of this continues to be excellent operating performance. If you look at segment operating income dollars, that increased by $173 million in the quarter. That accounted for just a little over $1 of that EPS growth. And that equated to 74% of the increased earnings per share in the quarter.\nClearly, Aerospace Systems was a major driver of improvement. But what is really impressive is both industrial businesses also contributed to the increase in segment operating income dollars.\nIf you look at tax, that was $0.18 favorable versus prior year, again, just driven by some discrete items. Other expense was favorable $0.12 versus prior year. That was mainly the result of currency changes and some favorable pension expense. Interest expense was $0.10 favorable versus prior. That really is a result of our successful efforts to reduce outstanding debt over the last 12 months. I'll talk about that in a little bit later in the deck. Corporate G&A and share count were just both slightly higher than prior year, just a net $0.03.\nAnd those are the components of the increase in adjusted earnings per share. Really, it's just strong margin performance across the company, continue with some great outstanding performance from the Meggitt business.\nIf you go to the next slide, excuse me, if you go to Slide 11, we'll talk about the segment performance. That's detailed on Slide 11. I couldn't be prouder of the broad-based margin expansion really driven by the Win Strategy. Jenny mentioned this, but our synergies are ahead of schedule. We did increase that synergy number.\nAerospace demand really remains very, very high. So just a nice consistent execution across our businesses, across all of our global team members. You can see that segment operating margin, 24.5%, at the bottom of the page, up 300 basis points. Incrementals were stellar at over 100%. And orders remain positive at plus 2 versus prior year, and backlog really remains resilient. Total backlog dollars did increase slightly sequentially as well. And Jenny mentioned this, but total backlog remains at near record levels. And aerospace activity remains especially robust.\nIf you look at the North American businesses, sales volume reached $2.1 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was down 1.5% versus prior year. That was driven by continued destocking, some channel rebalancing, and really some softness in off-highway markets. However, what is impressive out of the North American team is that adjusted operating margins did increase 240 basis points to a second quarter record of 24.2%. That was just really driven by excellent execution, some great efficiency improvements and really some tight cost controls. Orders in North America also remained consistent with the prior quarter. They remained at down minus 4.\nIf you look at the international businesses, sales were $1.4 billion, slightly positive versus prior year. Organic growth was essentially flat, which was better than we were forecasting. Organic growth in EMEA was positive at 0.7. Latin America was positive at 9.2. And Asia Pac did improve, it did come in at negative 2.5, really just being pulled down by the slower-than-expected recovery in China. But also what's impressive there is adjusted operating margins did expand 110 basis points in these businesses, and also finished at a second quarter record of 23%.\nThat international team continues to be focused on productivity improvements, expanding margins, and being very resilient across the segment even in a low growth environment. Very impressive results. Orders in the international segment did improve. If you remember, last quarter, they were minus 8. They did improve to minus 5.\nAnd finally, on Aerospace Systems, they delivered another standout quarter. Sales reached $1.3 billion, a 15% increase from prior year. All of that 15% is organic growth. And volume just continues to be driven by commercial aftermarket growth that was, in the quarter, up 25%.\nOperating margins reached a new record, increasing by 590 basis points to reach 26.5%. Really, the healthy volumes, the favorable aftermarket mix, outstanding performance from the Meggitt business really all contributed to drive these record margins.\nWe are increasing the synergies. Jenny went over that just briefly. Cumulative synergies were increasing from $150 million to $200 million. And order rates in aerospace continue to remain plus 21, which is very robust.\nOn the next slide, we'll talk about cash flow. Let's take a look at what we've done there. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.4 billion. That's 14% of sales. That is an increase of 26% versus prior year. Just fantastic cash flow performance.\nIf you look at free cash flow, that was $1.1 billion. That's up 11.9%, also increasing significantly, 29% increase from prior. Our cash flow conversion is year-to-date 86%.\nWe really have the team remaining focused on being great generators and great deployers of cash. You've heard us say that many times. Last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share. That is our 295th consecutive quarterly dividend. Just a nice, solid testament to our belief that we can be great generators and great deployers of cash.\nWhen you look at the full year, we are increasing our expectations for free cash flow. We've increased that range to $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. That's moving the midpoint up $150 million, to approximately $3 billion. And of course, free cash flow conversion will be over 100% for the full year.\nOn the next slide, let's take a look at our progress on deleveraging. We did reduce debt another $400 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, since we closed Meggitt just 5 quarters ago, we have reduced debt by over $2.2 billion now and we've improved our leverage by 1.4 turns, both ahead -- both of those figures are ahead of what we've originally committed to.\nIf you look at the metrics, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.4, net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.3. And we continue to forecast just approximately $2 billion of debt pay down in the fiscal year. And now based on the performance we've got year-to-date, we expect to achieve net leverage of 2.0x by June of 2024. Just great performance across the board.\nOkay. On guidance, just a few details on guidance. You saw the increase to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year organic growth midpoint and increasing our margin and earnings per share expectations for the year.\nOur reported sales growth for the year is forecasted to be in the range of 3% to 5% or roughly 4% at the midpoint, and they are modeled 49% first half, 51% second half. In respect to organic growth, we are raising the aerospace organic growth midpoint by 200 basis points to 12% for the full year. We are also raising the international organic growth midpoint by 100 basis points to minus 2. That's slightly better than what we gave you last quarter.\nThose increases are offset by a decrease in the North American organic growth midpoint by 200 basis points to minus 1.5. Full year organic growth for the entire company remains the same as last quarter at plus 1.5%.\nMoving on to margins. Adjusted segment operating margin guidance is being raised to 24.3 at the midpoint. That's up 70 basis points from prior guidance. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, that would be 140 basis points of margin expansion versus prior year.\nMeggitt synergies, we've talked a lot about that, we're moving that to $200 million. Corporate G&A, interest and other are relatively unchanged from our prior guide. Tax rate is tweaked just a little bit. We expect the full year to be 22.5%. That's really based on the performance in the first half. We expect the second half to be 23.7% from a tax rate perspective.\nFull year as-reported earnings per share increased to $20.30 and full year adjusted earnings per share has increased to 24 and 20. Both of those are at the midpoint.\nAnd finally, for FY '24 Q3 adjusted earnings per share, we expect that to be $6 even at the midpoint. And as usual, we've included some more specifics in the appendix.\nSo that's it on the increase to the guide. Jenny, I will hand it back to you and ask everyone to move to Slide 15.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. A few key messages to close this out. Q2, as we stated many times, was an exceptional quarter that closed a strong first half. We'll continue to drive positive results and accelerate our performance using the Win Strategy. Our portfolio and strengthened customer value proposition, along with growth from secular trends, will deliver organic growth of 4% to 6% over the cycle.\nWe remain committed to our FY '27 targets of approximately $30 earnings per share and greater than $3.5 billion free cash flow. We expect another year of record performance, and we have a very promising future ahead of us. We look forward to talking to you about our promising future at our investor meeting on May 16 of this year.\nBack to you, Todd?\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Diego, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A, and we'll take whoever is first in the queue."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Diego. Welcome to Parker's Fiscal Year 2024 First Quarter Earnings Release Webcast. As Diego said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer, speaking. Thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Jenny Parmentier, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President.\nOur comments today will be addressing forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 of this presentation provide specific details to our disclosures in respect to these areas. Actual results could vary from our projections based on the items listed here.\nOur press release, this presentation and reconciliations for all non-GAAP measures were released this morning and are available under the Investors section at parker.com. And they will remain available there for 1 year.\nToday, Jenny is going to start with some highlights of our outstanding first quarter. She will also reiterate how our portfolio transformation, along with strong aerospace secular trends, position Parker for a promising future. I will then provide some financial details on the quarter and detail our increase to our fiscal year '24 guidance. Jenny is going to wrap up. And then Jenny, Lee and I will take as many questions as we could fit in the hour.\nAnd with that, I would ask you to move to Slide 3. And Jenny, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q1 was a standout quarter, driven by a strong portfolio and our teams executing The Win Strategy.\nStarting with safety, a 16% reduction in recordable incidents. Safety has been and will remain our top priority. Record sales of $4.8 billion in the quarter, a 15% increase over prior year with organic growth of 2.3%. Record adjusted segment operating margin of 24.9%, a 220 basis point increase over prior year with all segments coming in above 24% and 26% adjusted EPS growth along with 11.4% free cash flow margin.\nThe combination of Parker and Meggitt delivered an outstanding quarter for aerospace and a strong start to the year. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our FY '24 guidance, and Todd will go over this later in the slide deck.\nNext slide, please. Many of you have seen this slide before. The transformation of our portfolio over the last 8 years has doubled the size of aerospace, filtration and engineered materials. As a result of this, from FY '15 to FY '24 guidance, you can see the obvious shift to a longer cycle and secular revenue mix. We have high confidence that by fiscal year '27, we'll have approximately 85% of the company in long cycle end markets and industrial aftermarket.\nNext slide, please. The mix shift that I just spoke of is evident in our strong backlog. For total Parker, backlog remains resilient. Coverage has doubled from 27% in fiscal year '16 to 54% today, and this has been consistent for the last several quarters.\nAerospace backlog is extremely robust. This coverage will support high single-digit growth well into the future. Industrial backlog coverage continues to be 2x what it was in the past, from mid-teens to low 30s. We now have longer-term visibility from the portfolio changing acquisitions with secular and longer-cycle exposure.\nNext slide, please. We have transformed the portfolio, and we have strong backlog. Let me remind you of the future sales growth drivers. The Win Strategy is our business system that delivers growth and financial performance. It is a proven strategy, and every tool in this system expands margins.\nMacro CapEx reinvestment is addressing the last decade of underinvestment as well as investments to strengthen and develop the supply chain. This will result in increased equipment spend and higher levels of automation.\nUnder innovation, our new product blueprinting tools and Simple by Design principles have increased our product vitality index, that is the percent of sales from new products, enabling faster growth and support of the secular trends. And as mentioned on the previous slide, the acquisitions we have made are great companies with higher growth rates, aftermarket and accretive margins.\nWe continue to benefit from the growth related to the secular trends. As previously stated, we expect multiple years of solid growth in aerospace, driven by both commercial and defense. And no matter what the energy source is, from diesel to electric to hybrid, the primary Parker content that we have today increases 1.5 to 2x with electrification.\nWith 2/3 of our portfolio supporting clean technologies, we are well positioned today, even better for tomorrow, and we are truly energy-agnostic. Again, all of this is giving us high confidence to grow differently than we have in the past and achieve our 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle.\nNext slide, please. Now 30% of our business, aerospace is a growth differentiator for Parker. And Parker and Meggitt are a powerful combination. This team has embraced The Win Strategy and is exceeding our expectations. We couldn't be happier with this acquisition.\nNext slide, please. From nose to tail, we have a comprehensive portfolio of products and services. Parker has a broad product offering for both airframe and engine applications. Meggitt brought new product and system areas, including braking, fire detection and suppression, thermal management, avionics and sensors and electric power. This breadth of technologies is enabling a more strategic relationship and discussions with our customers, both OEM and aftermarket.\nNext slide, please. This slide highlights the favorable aerospace secular trend we are experiencing now and will into the future. Taking a look at the sales mix at the top of the page, we are now 45% aftermarket, an 800 basis point increase with the acquisition of Meggitt. And we have a balanced portfolio with strong growth drivers in each of these 4 areas.\nAt the bottom of the page are the macro growth drivers. On the commercial side, we are expecting double-digit growth in aircraft deliveries and air traffic. On the military side, the Department of Defense budget increases. And our military aftermarket partnerships will drive mid- and long-term growth, a very promising future for aerospace.\nI'll now turn it over to Todd to go through the summary of our Q1 results.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. I'm going to begin here on Slide 11 and just touch on some of the financial results. Jenny mentioned this, our FY '24 is off to a very strong start, really speaks to the alignment across our global team.\nWe broke several records this quarter. We set records for sales and on an adjusted basis, segment operating margin, EBITDA margin, net income and earnings per share. If you look at the sales growth, it's up 15% versus prior year, obviously, strongly impacted by the net of acquisitions and divestitures. You look at that impact, that was a little over 11% positive to our growth.\nOrganic growth remained positive at 2.3%, and currency was actually a slight favorable 1% impact in the quarter. When you look at adjusted segment operating margin, it was 24.9%. That is an increase of 220 basis points versus prior year. And if you look at adjusted EBITDA margin, that was 24.8%, an increase of 150 basis points versus prior year.\nIf you look at adjusted net income, we generated $776 million in net income. And adjusted EPS was a record at $5.96. If you look at both of those items, it's a 26% improvement versus prior year.\nAnd we can't say this enough, it's our portfolio transformation and really consistent execution across the global team, just great work delivering a standout quarter here. And I'm really pleased to say that these results are consistent across all of our businesses.\nIf you can move to Slide 12, this just kind of details the 26% increase in earnings per share, that's $1.22 of improvement. What I really like about this chart, the main driver continues to be standout operating performance.\nWe increased segment operating margin dollars by nearly $250 million. That was $1.46 of our EPS growth. And while all segments contributed to growth, really the strength in our aerospace business was a major driver this quarter.\nIf you look at income tax, that was $0.17 favorable this year. Really, that is solely based off of a few discrete items that settled in the quarter. We did have some headwinds on the other expense line of $0.27 and also the interest expense line of $0.10. But I will tell you, both of those items are simply related to timing with last year's funding of the Meggitt transaction. We do not expect those to repeat going forward.\nAnd finally, corporate G&A and share count were just slightly [indiscernible] at $0.02 each, and that is -- really that is in line with what we guided to. So nothing of concern there. So that's the walk to the record $5.96 in EPS, and it really is just driven off a broad-based offering improvements.\nObviously, the Meggitt results are in there. The synergies are in there. And as you can see, strong record margins across all of the businesses, just great job by the team.\nOn Slide 13, we'll just talk a little bit about segment performance. Every segment delivered adjusted operating margins over 24%. That's the first time in the history of the company that, that has happened. And it was really, again, just driven by strong performance, good volumes.\nObviously, Meggitt synergies helped quite a bit, and really just the global team is very aligned. If you look at incrementals, we did 40% incrementals versus prior year, really proud of that number. And orders are positive at plus 2 versus prior year. And backlog coverage, as Jenny mentioned, really remains elevated. And again, aerospace activity remains especially robust on the order line. So just great work there.\nAnd then lastly, I would just say as we celebrate that 1-year anniversary with Meggitt, we're really very pleased that those businesses continue to outperform. It's been a great addition to the company.\nIf you look at North America specifically, sales volume is up 4.5%. We generated $2.2 billion of sales. Organic growth was slightly positive, just 0.5% there. And that was impacted by some destocking and channel rebalancing that we've kind of mentioned throughout the quarter.\nIf you look at adjusted operating margins, we did increase operating margins 150 basis points to 24.9%. And that was really just great execution and obviously cost controls. So great work there.\nAnd if you look at orders in North America, they did improve versus last quarter. They are minus 4. They did improve from minus 8. And backlog coverage in North America obviously remains strong as well. So great work to our North America team.\nIn the international businesses, sales were $1.4 billion. That is an increase of about 2.5% versus prior year. Organic growth in the segment was about negative 2. So that was down.\nOrganic growth in EMEA was positive 2, right? So that was a plus. Latin America, also very positive at plus 8. The impact of the segment was really driven by Asia Pacific, and that was about a negative 8 organic growth. And that's really just a result of mostly China softness that I think is well documented and also some tough comps that we had in the prior year.\nHowever, if you look at operating margins, even with that negative 2 organic growth, we expanded operating margins by 100 basis points. And the segment finished at 24.1%.\nSo our team members there are focused on productivity, cost controls. The team really expanded margins in a very, very tough environment. So just great, resilient performance across the segment there, very nice work.\nOrder rates do continue to be choppy. They did decline to minus 8. Really, that is conditions driven really out of Europe and China.\nThe standout for the quarter is our aerospace business, right? Just a stellar quarter from aerospace. Sales were $1.2 billion. That was an increase of 65% versus prior year. Organic growth, very robust at about 16%. And that was really broad-based, double-digit growth in all of the aerospace market platforms. So business is very strong there.\nOperating margins, unbelievable, a new record, increasing 610 basis points to 26%. Really, that was driven by healthy margins, rate increases at the airlines, strong aftermarket growth, really all those things contributing to great margin performance.\nI will note, we did benefit from a few small favorable onetime contractual settlements in the quarter. And we do not expect those to repeat throughout the rest of our fiscal year.\nAerospace orders, I already mentioned this, but plus 24 are very robust. Great future for the aerospace business.\nIf you move to Slide 14, just a quick look at cash flow. Our cash flow from operations increased 42% versus prior year. Cash flow from operations was $650 million. That's 13.4% of sales. Our free cash flow increased even more, 48% increase versus prior year, finished at $552 million for the quarter. That's 11.4% of sales, and free cash flow was 85%.\nFor the full year, we are committed to our strong cash flow generation profile. We are forecasting mid-teens cash flow from operations. And of course, we will extend our record free cash flow conversion of over 100% [indiscernible]. So great start to the year on cash flow.\nMoving to Slide 15. I just want to touch real quick on our leverage reduction. I think everybody knows we are focused on our leverage reduction commitment.\nWe reduced debt in the quarter by $370 million. And just since the Meggitt close, we've reduced that by over $1.8 billion and improved our leverage by 1.2 turns. Both of those numbers are ahead of what we originally scheduled.\nIf you look at gross debt to EBITDA, it's now 2.6 and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.5. And of course, we are still committed to forecast over 10 -- over $2 billion of debt paydown in FY '24. So great work there that [indiscernible].\nLooking forward on Slide 16, just some details on guidance. Basically, we are reaffirming our full year organic growth midpoint. We did incorporate September 30 currency rates. And we are increasing our margin and EPS expectations for the year.\nReported sales growth for the year is now forecasted to be in the range of 2.5% to 5.5% or roughly 4% at the midpoint. That split will be just as it always is, 49% in the first half, 51% in the second half.\nWe are raising our aerospace organic growth guidance 200 basis points from 8% in our prior guide, now 10%. So that's great to see that business performing so well.\nFull year organic growth is tweaked just a little bit. The company will remain at 1.5%. Currency is a small offset, which is now expected to be just a slight headwind to our prior guide.\nMargins, if you look at margins, we're raising our margin expectation to 23.6. At the midpoint, there's a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And if you look at what we're forecasting on a year-over-year change, we're increasing that expectation to 70 basis points of margin expansion versus prior year. It was 30 basis points in our prior guide.\nIncremental margins really just based off of the strong Q1 performance, we expect those to be around 40% for the full year. And if you look at the other items, corporate G&A, interest and other are relatively unchanged to what we guided to last quarter.\nTax rate for Q2 through Q4 we expect to be 23.5. So if you look at the full year, that will equate to about 23% on the tax line. And EPS on an as-reported basis is now $19.13 at the midpoint, and adjusted EPS is $23. And the range on both of those items is $0.40 plus or minus.\nSplit remains the same, 48% first half, 52% second half. And specifically for Q2, adjusted EPS is now expected to be $5.17 at the midpoint. And as usual, if needed, we have more guidance specifics that are included in the appendix, and that's all I had.\nJenny, I'll turn it back to you, Slide 17.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. And now I would like to recognize our colleague and friend, Lee Banks, during his last quarter earnings call. Lee will be retiring as Vice Chairman and President effective December 31, 2023. He joined Parker in 1991, has been an officer of the company since 2006 and a director since 2015.\nDuring Lee's tenure, sales grew at a 7% CAGR to nearly $20 billion. EPS grew from $0.36 per share in fiscal year '91 to $21.55 adjusted per share in fiscal year '23. Since 2015, total shareholder return was 292% versus S&P 500 industrial sector of 80%.\nAs if all of this isn't enough, I'd like to repeat a few of my comments from last week's shareholder meeting when we announced Lee's retirement. It's obviously not possible to overstate the tremendous positive impact Lee has had on our company, our businesses and our team members around the world.\nHis legacy and track record is nothing short of extraordinary. From leading our largest businesses to growing our global distribution network to championing and driving operational excellence to co-creating the recent versions of The Win Strategy and probably most importantly and what he's proud of is to recruiting, leading and developing many of our most talented leaders and beyond, Lee's set the bar for us for what good looks like and was a key leader in the transformation of Parker's performance and portfolio.\nLee, on behalf of all of us, we can't thank you enough. We will miss you. And we wish you and your family nothing but great health and happiness in your retirement.\n\nLee C. Banks\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Parker-Hannifin Corp.\n\nThank you, Jenny. Thank you, Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nLee, we know you're going to crush retirement just like you crushed [indiscernible].\n\nLee C. Banks\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Parker-Hannifin Corp.\n\nI've got a plan.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nAll right. Next slide, please. A few key messages to close this out before Q&A. Q1 was a great start to fiscal year '24. Our focus on safety and engagement will continue to drive positive results in our business.\nWe have a proven track record, and we're going to continue to accelerate our performance with The Win Strategy 3.0. It's been a successful first year with Meggitt. And the transformation of the portfolio is delivering a longer cycle and more resilient revenue mix, allowing us to achieve our FY '27 goals and continue to be great generators and deployers of cash. We have a very promising future ahead of us.\nBack to you, Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nDiego, we're going to open the call for Q&A. So we'll take whoever's first in the queue. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you so much, Donna. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Parker Hannifin's Fiscal Year '23 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Release Webcast. As Donna said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. And with me today for the webcast is Jenny Parmentier, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President.\nI think everyone knows we released our results and all of these slide materials this morning. Our comments today will address forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures. On Slide 2 of this presentation, you will find specific details to the disclosures that we are making in respect to non-GAAP financial measures and forward projections. And just as a reminder, actual results could vary from what we speak about today in this presentation based on all of the items listed here in these disclosures. Our press release, this presentation and all reconciliations are available under the Investors section at parker.com, and those will remain available for 1 year.\nToday, we're going to start with Jenny addressing some of the highlights of our strong fourth quarter and really what was a transformational fiscal year for Parker. She is also going to reiterate some reasons that show why Parker is so well positioned for the future. I'm going to follow up with just some color on how the quarter wrapped up and provide some details around our initial FY '24 guidance that we released this morning. Jenny will wrap up the call with some key messages, and then we're going to open up the lines for Q&A for Jenny, Lee or myself.\nSo now I'll ask you all to move to Slide 3. And Jenny, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q4 was a quarter of outstanding performance across all of Parker.\nStarting with safety. We remain in the top quartile with a 20% reduction in recordable incidents. Safety has been and will remain our top priority. We had record sales of $5.1 billion in the quarter, a 22% increase over prior year with organic growth of 6%. This is our second quarter above $5 billion in sales.\nWe achieved record adjusted segment operating margin of 24%, a 110 basis point increase over prior year. And as we discussed last quarter, our backlog coverage remains resilient at 55% and has increased 1% sequentially. The Win Strategy and portfolio changes have delivered a strong finish to a great year.\nNext slide, please. A great and transformational year. On the right side of the page, you can see highlights from fiscal year '23. Again, it all starts with our team. Top-quartile safety and engagement delivers these results. We now have approximately 30% of the portfolio in aerospace and defense, and we couldn't be happier with the progress of the Meggitt integration. The team is exceeding our expectations. And a record $3 billion operating cash flow, 22% higher than prior year, allowing us to make great progress in paying down debt. Todd will give you a few more details on this in his upcoming slides.\nNext slide, please. Many of you have seen this slide before. As you know, over the past 8 years, we have strategically reshaped the portfolio to double the size of aerospace, filtration and engineered materials. I'd like to draw your attention to the middle of the page for the FY '23 update.\nThe data line represents where we originally forecasted our longer-cycle and secular trends revenue to be at the end of the year. The aero and new solid line represent that we have realized a bigger shift to longer-cycle revenue. The combination of the portfolio changes and secular trends is already and will continue to create a profound shift in our revenue mix. We have high confidence that by FY '27, we will have approximately 85% of the company in long-cycle end markets and industrial aftermarket. This mix shift is further reason while we will grow differently in the future.\nNext slide, please. Diving a little deeper into our future sales growth drivers. The 5 buckets on this slide will allow us to achieve our FY '27 target of 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle. The Win Strategy is our business system. It delivers growth and financial performance. Every tool in this system expands margins.\nCapEx reinvestment is addressing the last decade of underinvestment as well as investments to strengthen and develop the supply chain. This will result in increased equipment spend and higher levels of automation. And under innovation, our new product blueprinting tools and Simple by Design principles have increased our product vitality index, that is the percent of sales from new products. This enables faster growth and support of the secular trends.\nThe acquisitions we have made are great companies with higher growth rates, aftermarket and accretive margins. We continue to benefit from the growth related to secular trends. We expect multiple years of solid growth in aerospace driven by both commercial and defense. And we are enjoying an increased bill of material on all electric passenger vehicles and continue to partner with our mobile customers on electrifying their equipment and helping them to achieve their carbon-neutral goals. And today, 2/3 of our portfolio enables these clean technologies. Again, all of this giving us high confidence to grow differently than we have in the past and achieve our 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle.\nNext slide, please. As a reminder, living up to our purpose, top-quartile performance and being great generators and deployers of cash is what drives Parker. This slide provides an update on living up to our purpose: enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. We are committed and on track to be carbon-neutral by 2040 and achieved a 20% carbon reduction in fiscal year '23. And we are proud to be in the first quartile of the Carbon Disclosure Project on climate change.\nPost pandemic, our teams were anxious to get back into the communities where we work and volunteered over 10,000 hours in fiscal year '23 to help serve others. And again, our clean technologies are critical in helping our customers achieve their carbon-neutral goals.\nNext slide, please. The combination of our growth drivers and living up to our purpose points to a very promising future for Parker. We are committed to our FY '27 targets of growing EPS from $21.55 to $30 and achieving 25% adjusted segment operating margin. Growth from secular trends, continued transformation of the portfolio with Meggitt and continuing to accelerate our performance with Win Strategy 3.0 will drive top-quartile performance and organic growth of 4% to 6% over the cycle.\nWe have entered fiscal year 2024 on a solid foundation. The guidance that we are sharing with you today reflects continued progress to these FY '27 goals. Todd will go through the quarter in the guide, and then I will be back with more comments on our guide assumptions and why we are still very bullish about the future and the 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle.\nOver to you, Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. If everyone's following, I'm going to start on Slide 10. And I'm really proud to say once again, every Q4 number highlighted in this gold box is a record for the company. It was really just an unbelievably strong finish to the fiscal year.\nI'm going to try to move quickly because Jenny already spoke to the 22% sales growth and the 24% segment operating margin. But in respect to sales, organic growth was 6%. When you take a look at the Meggitt acquisitions and the divestitures that we did in FY '23, the net addition for the quarter was 16%. And the good news here is on currency, the headwinds have moderated. It's now was just a slight a headwind of 0.4% in the quarter.\nOne thing I do want to note is adjusted EBITDA margins, 24.4%. That's an increase of 130 basis points versus prior year. And if you could tend you down the page, both net income and adjusted earnings per share did increase by 18% versus the prior year. Our adjusted net income was $791 million or a 15.5% return on sales, and adjusted EPS was $6.08 in the quarter. That is an increase of $0.92 or 18% versus prior year.\nInternally, we always stress how important it is to finish strong. And really, these results are just really a testament to the resilience of our global team. So thank you to everyone for a great Q4 and a great fiscal year '23.\nIf you move to Slide 11, this is just a bridge on how we generated that $6.08. This is a $0.92 walk. And I'm proud to say, again, you could see the biggest bar on this page is increased segment operating income. If you look at that, we increased segment operating dollars by $264 million. That's nearly 28% increase year-over-year. That added $1.63 of EPS to our total for the quarter.\nThere were a few headwinds below the segment that are really no surprise. Obviously, that interest is 100% related to Meggitt. That's consistent with what we've seen in past quarters. And income tax was favorable this year in the quarter. Even though we did finish favorable, it was a headwind of $0.19 compared to what we did last quarter.\nAnd if you think about that, last quarter, we did have a few onetime items that were related with the acquisition that were favorable and some higher discretes last year. Those were obviously nonrepeating issues this year. So the story on the walk is just really strong operating execution, and it's really across the board.\nIf you move to Slide 12, just some details on the segment performance. Every segment delivered positive organic growth this quarter, but they also delivered positive margin expansion, you can see across the board here. Incrementals were very strong, and all of these margins are records.\nAnd I'm also proud to say, even with the challenging comparisons, orders did increase from last quarter to a plus-3% versus prior year. And our backlog did increase 1% sequentially and did reach a record, $11 billion. So this is really the result of robust aerospace activity but also the changes to the portfolio that we spoke to throughout the year.\nJust jumping into the North American businesses. Sales were very strong, $2.3 billion. That was 5% organic. That's really right in line with our guide. Adjusted operating margins did increase 60 basis points to 23.5%, really just driven by excellent execution across those North American businesses. Incrementals also did improve sequentially, and that helped drive our margin expansion.\nOne thing to note, orders did turn negative to 8%, but that really still is against tough comps. We still have strong backlog coverage that we believe will continue to support growth. And customer sentiment overall remains positive in North America. So all in all, a great quarter and a great finish by our North American team members.\nIf you look at the international businesses, sales were $1.5 billion; organic growth, nearly 4%. Organic growth did remain positive in all of our international regions, really led by Asia Pacific, 8.5%, almost 8.6%. Latin America was 2.5% positive. And even EMEA, which we've seen some softness, did post a 1% positive organic growth.\nEven with all that said, margins did increase 90 basis points, finished at 23.3% versus prior year and really still continue to reflect consistent performance, productivity improvement, good cost controls and that increase in distribution mix that we've talked about periodically.\nOrders in the international business did improve from last quarter. They are still negative 1, but it is a nice improvement from last quarter. And again, from our international team members, great consistent performance, and I'm glad to see these results.\nIf you move to aerospace, this is really the story of the quarter, really a standout, just fantastic results all around. Sales are $1.3 billion, 16% organic. Total sales are a 90% increase versus prior year. That's really obviously benefiting from the Meggitt acquisition. But if you look at the business, commercial OEM and MRO continue to be very strong. Both of those businesses are growing at plus 20% and versus prior in the quarter.\nThe military OEM business did return to growth this quarter with high single-digit organic performance. That was really nice to see. And operating margins, a new record high, really increasing an impressive 160 basis points to 25.8%. Those strong margins reflect that growth in the commercial aftermarket businesses and really notably a nice favorable mix of spares versus repairs.\nSo you can also see the addition of Meggitt has also increased our aftermarket exposure. That was one of the compelling aspects of that acquisition. We're glad to see that materialize in the results.\nThe aerospace team is really doing a phenomenal job, obviously, dealing with growth. The integration is ahead of schedule and on track, and these results are really fantastic to see. It's really truth that Parker and Meggitt are really better together.\nIf you look at aerospace order rates, plus 28%, continues to be robust and then obviously, it's helping our backlog. Great performance across the segments.\nIf I jump to Slide 13, I just want to highlight our cash flow performance. We finished the year with extremely strong cash flow. It was a record in FY '23. We increased cash flow from operations 22%. We reached a record $3 billion of cash flow from operations. That's 15.6% of sales. Free cash flow, also very strong, $2.6 billion or 13.6% of sales. Our CapEx came in right where we were forecasting, 2%. And just as a note, because this was the closing of Meggitt, we did have some transaction-related expenses that were a drag to cash flow that was about 1% of sales. So those obviously aren't going to repeat next year. And we have set ourselves up extremely well to be great generators of cash.\nIf you look at conversion, free cash flow conversion for the year, 125%. And I just really want to thank our teams for the great work on working capital. We strive to be great generators, great deployers of cash, and reaching this $3 billion milestone is really the result of significant effort from our team across the globe.\nIf you go to Slide 14, you can see what we did with all that cash. We reduced debt by $850 million in the quarter. Since we closed Meggitt just this fiscal year in September, we have reduced our debt by $1.4 billion. Since announcing Meggitt way back in August of 2021, we have already paid down approximately 35% of the total consideration of nearly $10 billion. So very impressive work across the board by our team.\nIf you look at leverage, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA finished the year at 2.8%, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA finished the year at 2.7 -- excuse me, 2.7x. We've spoken about our great track record of how we are so dedicated to quickly deleveraging after the deals. And since closing the transaction in September, we have already reduced leverage by 1 full turn. So we're proud of that.\nLooking forward to next year, we expect to generate significant cash flow. We think we can reduce debt by an additional $2 billion in FY '24. And we are targeting leverage of 2x in early FY '25.\nOkay. So moving to guidance and putting FY '23 to bed. You could see what we are looking at here is Slide 15. And I'll start with the top line. Reported sales growth for the year is forecasted to be in the range of 3% to 6% or 4.5% at the midpoint. That equates to approximately $19.9 billion in total sales. If you look at the split, the first half is 49% and the second half is 51%.\nSpeaking specifically to organic growth, for the full year, we expect to be 1.5% at the midpoint. In respect to aerospace, we're expecting high single-digit growth in aerospace, a little over 8%. North America organic, we expect that to still be positive at plus 1%. And international, we are forecasting slightly negative at 2.5%. Those are all full year numbers.\nThe backlog that I just spoke of earlier does support our growth, so we feel confident in these numbers. And if you look at the breakdown, the guidance does assume acquisition sales, roughly $500 million from Meggitt, offset by $400 million of the divestitures that we did complete in FY '23. So the net impact is $460 million or about 2.5% of our total sales.\nI mentioned currency earlier based on spot rates as of June 30. We do expect currency to be a slight tailwind of 0.5% or roughly $100 million. So that is based on currency rates as of June 30. We still see margin expansion this year. 30 basis points is what we're forecasting for FY '24. That is all based on continuing to accelerate our performance across all of our businesses using The Win Strategy and, of course, delivering on Meggitt synergies that we have communicated.\nIf you look at adjusted segment operating margin, our guidance is 23.2% at the midpoint, and there is a range of 20 basis points on either side of that midpoint. If you look at operating income dollars -- segment operating income dollars, the split is 47% first half, 53% second half. And for the full year, we are forecasting incremental margins of 30%.\nA few other items in respect to guidance. Corporate G&A is $240 million. That's a full year number. Interest expense is $525 million. That is a $40 million reduction from where we finished in FY '23, really just based on our strong debt pay down. And other expense is $25 million. Full tax rate, we're guiding at 23.5%. That is without any discrete items that is really a continuing rate from operations, 23.5%. And finally, we expect full year as reported EPS of $18.55 or on an adjusted basis, $22.40. The range -- those are both midpoint numbers. The range on either side of those is $0.50, plus or minus. And the split, 46% first half, 54% second half. And just specifically for Q1 of FY '24, we are forecasting adjusted EPS to be $5.10 at the midpoint.\nLooking at cash flow. Full year free cash flow is expected to be between $2.6 billion and $3 billion. So we'll be mid-teens free cash flow, and our conversion will be over 100%. Also included in the appendix is subsegment guidance details and some other specifics that you might find helpful.\nIf I move to Slide 16, this is just a bridge and really highlights as follow, again, very similar to what's happened throughout this fiscal year. The organic growth, the acquisition sales, margin expansion and the $75 million of incremental Meggitt synergies for the year translate to an increase in segment operating income of $1.47. We will have less interest expense next year based on that debt reduction that we've done, but -- and that will add $0.23 to EPS.\nOur forecasted tax rate of 23.5% is a headwind of $0.26. But remember, we had a lot of favorable items in FY '23. We're not forecasting those to continue. We also had lower interest income. If you remember, we prefunded those -- the Meggitt transaction in June of last year. So we had interest income in the first quarter of last year. That was about $35 million.\nJust to note, that is reported in the other expense/income line on the business segment statement. That was a one-off benefit that obviously will not repeat in FY '23. That's a $0.21 headwind. The rest is just a forecasted $0.20 unfavorable to EPS, and there's just some really some nonrepeating items in there. And obviously, share count is also a $0.10 headwind that we hope to make up. So that's the long term FY '23 to FY '24. EPS at the midpoint is forecasted to be $22.40.\nSo with that, Jenny, I'll hand it back to you and ask everyone to move to Slide 17.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Just a few key messages to close this out. So FY '23 was a tremendous year with record performance. We have top-quartile safety and engagement, and that continues to drive results in our business. We truly have a great team. We have a proven track record, and we're going to continue to accelerate our performance with The Win Strategy 3.0.\nThe transformation of the portfolio is clearly delivering on longer cycle and more resilient portfolio, and this will allow us to achieve our FY '27 targets and continue to be great generators and deployers of cash.\nSo before we go into Q&A, I'd like to give you a few of our assumptions and comments on the guide. So obviously, aerospace is a real growth differentiator for Parker in fiscal year '24. We are projecting total aerospace growth at 17% with the acquisition sales for Meggitt and organic growth of 8%. We see strong mid-teens growth in commercial and mid-single-digit in military. Good story all the way around.\nWe have now had 2 years in a row of double-digit growth for industrial. But having said that, as Todd mentioned, industrial orders have been negative for the past 2 quarters. However, in North America, backlog coverage is still above 30%, which is roughly double what it has been in the past, and it will support the growth we have in the first half.\nWe do expect some destocking to continue, but overall sentiment from our customers is positive about steady demand and future growth. Obviously, there's more macroeconomic uncertainty for the second half, and we'll update you on that in future calls.\nWhile we did see an improvement in international orders from Q3 to Q4, this does include a benefit coming from some of those multi-period, longer-cycle orders and an easier comp from last year's China COVID shutdown. Again, the backlog coverage remains above 30%. But as Todd said, we are forecasting negative growth for the first half and full year.\nSince the last time we talked, we've seen some signs of Europe slowing. Customers are returning to those seasonal shutdowns where they do maintenance in their facilities, and we're starting to see some softness in some of the end and geographic markets as well as some weakening macroeconomic indicators. And although China had stronger growth in Q4 than Q3, recovery is slower than anticipated, and then we will face a tough comp in Q1 against prior year China COVID rebound.\nSo in summary, this is our thinking right now: strong aerospace growth, strong backlog on the industrial side, some near-term uncertainties and tough comps, but the future growth drivers that I went through on the earlier slide remain intact, and activity is at a high level. We are still very bullish about the future and our 4% to 6% organic growth target over the cycle.\nSo now I'll hand it back to Donna for Q&A."

Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Parker's fiscal year 2023 Q3 Earnings Release Webcast. As Chris said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer, speaking. And joining me today is Jenny Parmentier, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President.\nOur third quarter results were released this morning. And just a reminder, today, we will be addressing forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures. On Slide 2 of this presentation, you'll find further details to our disclosures in these areas. Actual results may vary from our projections based on some of the details that are listed on this slide.\nOur press release, this presentation and all reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section at parker.com, and they will remain available for 1 year. We're going to begin the call today with Jenny addressing highlights of the third quarter and really touching on how Parker is so well positioned for the future. I will follow with a brief financial summary and then review the increase to our guidance that we released this morning. Jenny will then wrap up with summary comments, and then Jenny, Lee and myself will address any questions from the queue.\nI will all ask you now to address yourself to Slide 3. And Jenny, I'll hand over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q3 was a quarter of outstanding performance across all of Parker.\nStarting with safety. We remain in the top quartile with a 17% reduction in recordable incidents. Safety has been and will continue to be our top priority. We had record sales of $5.1 billion in the quarter, a 24% increase over prior year with organic growth of 12%. The Win Strategy and portfolio changes have clearly delivered record performance, driving a full year guidance increase. We are increasing the quarterly dividend 11% over last year, and we are happy to report today that the Meggitt integration and synergies are ahead of schedule for fiscal year '23.\nMoving to Slide 4, please. We couldn't be more pleased with the enthusiasm and dedication of the talented Meggitt team, further evidence to the shared heritage and culture identified early in the acquisition process. From the start of the integration, safety and engagement has been top priority. We have the key leaders and structure in place to ensure performance into the future and the Win Strategy deployment is well underway. The team picture on the right of this page is from a recent Kaizen event held in the Park U.K. location. And at the end of March, we held a Win Strategy training session here in Cleveland with over 50 leaders from various Meggitt locations.\nThere are multiple examples of where the Win Strategy has already taken root and is being used to improve the business. We are confident in our assumptions around working capital opportunities and are already starting to see some of them materialized. We are increasing our FY '23 synergies from $60 million to $75 million, and we remain committed to achieving $300 million in synergies by FY '26.\nSlide 5, please. With the addition of Meggitt to our portfolio, we are well positioned for long aerospace cycle growth. We have significant content on premier commercial and military programs, all the right ones with a growing bill of material. These are long life cycle programs with a growing aftermarket well into the future. As a reminder, with the addition of Meggitt, our aerospace aftermarket has increased 500 basis points.\nWe are greatly benefiting from the recovery of the aerospace market. Commercial MRO and OEM is very strong and military is positioned to do well in the upcoming years. With the addition of Meggitt complementary technologies, we provide a comprehensive offering and a stronger bill of material that allows us to add value and help solve our customers' problems.\nWe have key technologies such as advanced sensors for more efficient engine control, thermal management systems for higher heat loads and lightweight materials for reduced fuel consumption, all of these enabling sustainable aviation. Aerospace and defense markets are now 30% of our sales. All of this adds up to significantly increased shareholder value.\nSlide 6, please. Many of you have seen this slide before as we introduced it last year at our Investor Relations Day. Over the last 8 years, we have strategically reshaped the portfolio to double the size of aerospace, filtration and engineered materials. The combination of the portfolio changes and secular trends is already and will continue to create a profound shift in our sales mix. By FY '27, we will have approximately 85% of the company in long cycle end markets or industrial aftermarket. This mix shift is further reason while we will grow differently in the future, and it is why we are committed to our FY '27 target of 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle.\nSlide 7, please. A lot of discussion, questions and inquiries lately on backlog. And as you can see by the chart on the left of this page, our backlog is at a record level. What is encouraging is that in Q3, we saw our backlog dollars increased 3% sequentially. Since FY '16, we've seen a 3x increase in backlog dollars and a 2x increase in backlog coverage. Very important to note here that we are constantly analyzing the backlog at the division and group level and staying close to our customers on the health of the backlog. We know from the past that it isn't bulletproof. But having said that, this consistent growth over time is an indicator that the portfolio changes are changing the company.\nSlide 8, please. As demonstrated by the strong performance in the quarter, and the increasing power of our transformed portfolio, I want to share a few slides with you on why Parker is built for the present and the future.\nSlide 9, please. Parker has a proven business system, the Win Strategy 3.0. Whenever I talk to anyone about the Win Strategy, whether it's a new Parker team member or someone externally, I'd say the same thing. Trust me. I've used it and it works. It is a system focused on the fundamentals. We trust the process, and we know that making the safety and engagement of our team members, our top priority consistently delivers results. Our Lean tools, Kaizen culture, supply chain and simplification initiatives have driven margin expansion and will continue to do so well into the future.\nOur increased aerospace exposure is delivering results today as well as our 800 basis points expansion of international distribution, which still has room for growth. Our innovation sales are 2x the previous decade. And we have a new annual incentive plan that incentivizes the right behaviors and driving intensity around profitable growth throughout the whole company. Nearly all of our 65,000 team members are on this plan as of this fiscal year. Now more than ever, we have better top line resilience.\nSlide 10, please. And the good news is we have significant opportunities ahead. As I mentioned earlier, approximately 85% of our portfolio will be longer cycle and more resilient. There are strong Meggitt growth opportunities well into the future, and we are confident in achieving the $300 million in synergies by FY '26. The Win Strategy 3.0 performance acceleration will further drive margin expansion and ensure we hit our FY '27 goals.\nAs I mentioned in our February call, the pandemic and subsequent increase in volume exposed some areas that we can further improve upon to become supply chain leaders. We will utilize new tools and strategies to respond to changing demand while increasing productivity and achieving best-in-class lead times. Simplify design has become a business fundamental and will continue to drive us to design excellence by reducing complexity and overall product costs, thus helping to further expand our margins.\nWe're very excited about 0 defects. It's still early days. It exposes the hidden factory, improves quality, reduces cost, expands margins and most importantly, provides a better overall customer experience. And with all of the announced and already initiated Meggitt capital projects in addition to the secular trends, we will grow differently in the future.\nI'll now hand it over to Todd.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. Just for reference, everyone, I'm going to start on Slide 12 with just the Q3 financial summary. It was a stellar quarter for the company. Every number on this page highlighted in the gold box is a record for Q3, every single number. And Jenny did mention this, but we did surpass $5 billion in sales for the first time for a quarter in the history of the company. .\nReported sales were up 24% versus prior year. Organic sales were very robust at approximately 12% in the quarter, and that did extend our string of double-digit organic growth quarters. The net of acquisitions and divestitures did have a favorable impact on sales. That was approximately 15%. And currency still remains negative, but it's basically exactly as we forecast. It's minus 2.4% impact for the quarter and that is obviously unfavorable to prior year.\nWhen you look at adjusted segment operating margins, we did exceed our forecast. We finished at 23.2% for the quarter. That's an increase of 50 basis points versus prior year. It's the first time in history of the company that we surpassed 23% for a full quarter. So impressive results really across the board.\nWhen you look at dollars on segment operating margin, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in segment operating margin dollars. That itself is a 27% increase from prior year. And it happens to be the second quarter in a row that the company has generated over $1 billion in adjusted segment operating dollars.\nWhen you look at EBITDA, another record here. We surpassed 24% for the first time. In the history of the company, we finished at 24.2% and adjusted net income of $772 or 15.2% ROS, was an improvement of 22% versus prior year.\nAnd finally, when you look at EPS, adjusted EPS nearly $6, $5.93 for the quarter. That was an increase of $1.10 or 23% compared to prior year, just outstanding execution for the company for the quarter.\nWhen you look at sales, segment operating margin dollars, net income and earnings per share, every single one of those was an increase of greater than 20%. I can tell you, I'm just immensely proud of our team for the record performance. Meggitt is really truly adding value to the company, and the company is just executing soundly across the board.\nIf you go to Slide 13, this is just a walk on that $1.10 improvement of EPS year-over-year. And I mentioned on the last slide, the biggest driver of that is our increase in segment operating income dollars. We did basically an additional $250 million in segment operating income. That 27% increase. That added $1.50 to EPS year-over-year.\nWhen you look at the corporate G&A and other, that was a $0.23 favorable EPS impact that was primarily driven by lower salary and other benefit costs. Interest, as you all know, is a headwind. That was a $0.54 headwind, but 100% of that is attributed to the Meggitt acquisition and of course, what's going on in our rates.\nYou look at income tax that was $0.09 unfavorable. Really, it's driven by some prior year favorable items that were discrete that aren't repeating this year. And really, that's the walk to the $5.93. It's really a stellar number, record 23% increase.\nIf you go to Slide 14 across the segments, you can see, as I mentioned, it's really just across the board solid performance. Organic growth was a double-digit positive in every segment. We exceeded our margin expectations across the board and our legacy businesses really perform soundly with incremental margins above 30% in every single segment.\nBeginning this quarter on orders, we finalized the Meggitt structure. We felt good about that. And going forward, we are including Meggitt orders in both the prior and current period for comparison purposes. And we really feel that, that better reflects the transformed portfolio that Jenny mentioned earlier. So all in, orders remain positive despite really some tough comps versus prior year and finished at plus 2%.\nDemand remains really broad-based across most of our markets. And Jenny also mentioned this, but I just want to reiterate, the dollar value of orders in the quarter was certainly the highest that we've had in FY '23, and it did grow 9% sequentially from Q2. And of course, the backlog obviously is up 3% sequentially as well. So our team members are really just executing well to meet our customer expectations and really focus on delivering top quartile results.\nIf you look at the North American businesses, sales really strong at $2.3 billion. Organic growth was just under 12%. Adjusted segment operating margins nearly 23%. And if you remember, there is a dilutive impact on some of the Meggitt businesses that are in the Industrial North American businesses, but like I said before, the legacy business has really outperformed and strong sales growth in supply chains, improving gradually and really just great incrementals across those base businesses and really strong backlog and that demand is very solid across all of our North American businesses.\nInternational really outperformed in the quarter. Sales were $1.5 billion. Organic growth exceeded our expectations and finished at just about 10% organic growth versus prior year. Organic growth in the International segment was positive in all regions. EMEA was plus 11%, Asia Pac 8.5%, Latin America 8%. So all positive in every single region in the International segment.\nAdjusted operating margins were up 70 basis points, finished at 23.4%, really benefiting from that volume, that strong organic growth, but really some focus on cost control and productivity improvements really helped leverage result in the International segment this quarter. Overall, this really strong performance across every region.\nAnd then finally, aerospace, secular trend we've talked a lot about. Sales were $1.2 billion. That's almost 90% increase from prior year. That is obviously clearly driven by the Meggitt acquisition. But organic growth led the company in aerospace at 14.5% versus prior year. And really just strong across the board, OEM and MRO commercial businesses, sales and orders are very strong, both being mid-20s positive. And interesting, this quarter, military OEM returned to flat versus down from prior quarter.\nOperating margin is extremely sound, 23.5%. That's 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. Jenny mentioned it, but the Meggitt integration is going extremely well. Synergies are ahead of schedule. We did raise our synergy estimate for the quarter, $15 million and performance in those businesses continue to impress.\nOrder rates in aerospace, obviously very strong. You look at that order number of plus 25%, but both strong in commercial and military end markets. Just really sound operational performance across the company, no weak spots at all.\nMoving to Slide 15, just talking about our year-to-date cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations was 12.8% of sales. $1.8 billion of cash generated so far this fiscal year, that's 16% over what we did last year. Free cash flow is 10.9%. Our CapEx remains right at 2% like we have been forecasting. There are some onetime transactions that were the result of the Meggitt transaction. That impacts our cash flow by 1.5 points. So without those transactions, those numbers I just gave you would be 1.5% better. And free cash flow continues to be greater than 100%. We're at 111% year-to-date. And just I want to reiterate, for the full year, we continue to forecast cash flow from operations and free cash flow conversion of over $100 million and that free cash flow would be mid-teens for the year.\nIf we go to the next slide, just touching on capital deployment and some leverage. We did increase our quarterly dividend. Our Board approved this last week to an 11% increase. The dividend payout is now $1.48. That is in line with our stated target of being in the range of 30% to 35% of our trailing 5-year net income. And the increase this quarter does increase our annual record of increasing annual dividend paid from 66 years to 67 years. So long-standing record that we intend to keep.\nOn leverage, we did make some significant progress reducing leverage this quarter. We paid down approximately $650 million in debt in the quarter. If you look at our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, it was 3.2x. That's down from 3.6x last quarter. So 0.4 turns from Q2. And if you look at the net debt to adjusted EBITDA, finished the quarter at 3.1x. That's down 0.3 turns from Q2. So we are pleased with the deleveraging progress. We are on track and we continue to target our leverage commitment of 2.0x, and we are committed to delivering on our commitments there.\nLooking at Slide 17 and guidance. Obviously, we increased our guidance this morning. We have incorporated obviously the strong performance from Q3, but we've also increased our expectations for Q4. Full year sales growth at the mid point increases to 19% versus prior year with organic moving up to 10%. That's up from 7% last quarter.\nWhen you look at the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect that to be about 12%. That's just up slightly from 11.5% last quarter and currency remains a headwind, no change to our prior guidance, but the full year, we expect it to be a minus 3.\nWhen you look at adjusted segment operating margins, we've increased our full year guide by 40 basis points. We now are forecasting 22.5% for the full year. And the midpoint of adjusted EPS is raised to $20.75 for the full year with a range of plus or minus $0.15.\nJust some specific details for Q4. We expect organic growth to be approximately 4% in the quarter and segment operating margins to be approximately 22.6%. And finally, EPS for the quarter, we are forecasting $5.32 and at the midpoint, same range wrapped around that. And we've also included guidance by segment and several other details that could be useful for your models in the appendix.\nSo with that, just a really solid quarter. Glad to increase our guide. And with that, Jenny, I'll hand it back to you and ask everyone to reference Slide 18.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. As discussed today, Parker has a very promising future. Our highly engaged team is living up to our purpose as evidenced in the results. We will continue to accelerate our performance using the Win Strategy 3.0. And as mentioned several times, our portfolio transformation is making us longer cycle and more resilient. This will allow us to achieve our FY '27 targets and continue to be great generators and deployers of cash. We remain committed to top quartile performance. .\nNext slide, please. A quick look at our upcoming events for the rest of the calendar year. And with that, Chris, we are ready for questions."

Welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Corporation's Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Parker's fiscal year 2023 Q2 Earnings Release Webcast. As Chris said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. And joining me today is Jenny Parmentier, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President.\nOur second quarter results were released this morning and before we get started, I just want to remind everyone, we will be addressing forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 of this presentation details our disclosures, our disclosure statement to issues in these areas. These forward-looking statements detailed issues that could make actual results vary from our projections.\nOur press release, this presentation and all reconciliations for non-GAAP measures are now available under the Investors section at parker.com and will remain available for 1 year. We're going to start the call today with Jenny addressing some focus areas for the company as she takes on the role of CEO. She will then address some highlights for the quarter, which we just released this morning, and then I'll follow up with a brief financial summary and then review the increase to our FY '23 guidance that we issued this morning.\nJenny is going to wrap up with a few summary comments. And then Jenny, Lee and I will take as many of your questions as possible. I now ask you to reference Slide 3. And Jenny, I will hand it over to you.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCEO & Director, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. As Todd said, before we get into the quarter results, I'd like to remind everyone what drives Parker and give you some insight on where we'll be focusing.\nMoving to Slide 3. New CEO Same 3 drivers: living up to our purpose, continuing to be great generators and deployers of cash and achieving top-quartile performance versus our proxy peers.\nSlide 4, please. Safety, purpose and engagement are the foundation of top-quartile performance. As I mentioned to all of you in the December call, we are committed to delivering the Meggitt cost synergies of $300 million, and we're very pleased with the progress to date. We've said before, it's still early innings for Win Strategy 3.0, and we will continue to utilize it to accelerate our performance. Our culture is one of continuous improvement as evidenced by past performance and results we will deliver well into the future.\nAnd we are fully committed to achieving our FY '27 targets that we rolled out at Investor Day last March. All of this will allow us to continue with the transformation and ensure a very promising future for Parker.\nMoving to Slide 5, please. You've seen this before, Parker has a proven strategy. The Win Strategy is and will remain our business system. It is a system focused on the fundamentals. We trust the process, and we'll continue to get results from it as we have in the past.\nSlide 6, please. So where will Win Strategy 3.0 accelerate our performance? Well, it always starts with our people. Safety is number 1 and it always will be. Our goal is 0 incidents, and we believe it is possible. We brought a lot of new people into the business over the last couple of years, and we have the opportunity to double down on the training and chartering of high-performance teams and leaders. This will further strengthen our culture of continuous improvement and our brand of Kaizen well into the future.\nMoving over to customer experience. We have an opportunity to do even better with the digital customer experience. Anywhere from how we interact with our customers on quotes and orders, to the availability of digital products and the use of artificial intelligence for demand forecasting with both our customers and our suppliers. It's early days for our 0 defect initiative as well. This obviously drives better quality and overall customer satisfaction. This is the exact same approach that we took with 0 safety incidents. 0 defect is possible. It starts with engaging our people around robust products and capable processes. Doing this right exposes the hidden factory, improves quality, reduces cost and thus expands margin.\nBest-in-class lead times have been part of our Win strategy for many years. And coming out of the pandemic and subsequent increase in volume, we see even more opportunities to improve lead times and become supply chain leaders. Our customers deserve this level of service and all of these are strong enablers of growth. Profitable growth is a combination of performance and portfolio changes, which we have demonstrated. Strategic positioning is a tool used by our general managers to segment their business and position them best in their markets and with their customers. This process and cadence will continue to drive the critical thinking about growth in the division and closest to the customer.\nWe are obviously seeing the benefits of the transformed portfolio, and we will continue to seek out those opportunities that will enhance the transformation. The most significant CapEx spending in decades will bring growth to Parker with all the technologies we have supporting the secular trends today and for many years to come. And -- we have an annual cash incentive plan, which incentivizes the right behaviors and drives a real intensity around growth.\nMoving over to financial performance. We have a proven set of simplification tools, which will continue to help us reduce complexity and cost. House in this area is our simple by design process, which you've heard us talk about a lot. This has become a fundamental -- a business fundamental across the corporation. We have a robust process around value pricing, and we'll continue to strive for margin neutrality in these inflationary times. We will also double down on training the principles of Lean. This is the foundation of our continuous improvement culture and it drives safety and productivity in all of our operations.\nYou've heard us say many times over the past few years that while not immune to the chaos of the supply chain, we fared better than others due to our dual sourcing initiatives and our local-for-local strategy. The pandemic and subsequent increase in volume exposed some areas that we can further improve upon to ensure that we become supply chain leaders. Our teams are looking to further enhance the visibility of the changing demand picture and utilize some new scheduling tools that will drive efficiency in the operations and those best-in-class lead times that I just mentioned. Focusing on these areas and Win Strategy 3.0 will help us to achieve top-quartile performance.\nSlide 7, please. Our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. We will maintain our record on dividend payouts and target a 5-year average payout of 30% to 35% net income. We will target 2% of sales on CapEx to fund organic growth and productivity. The 10b5-1 share repurchase program will remain in place and our near-term and top priority is to delever post the Meggitt acquisition. We will keep our acquisition pipeline healthy and we'll continue to build relationships for future acquisitions.\nSlide 8, please. Q2 was another quarter of excellent operating performance. We saw a 16% reduction in safety incidents versus prior year, further supporting our ability to reach 0 incidents. Sales came in at $4.7 billion, a 22% increase to prior with organic growth coming in at 10%. Strong segment operating margin across all segments has led us to a full year guidance increase and we are very happy with the progress of the Meggitt integration. All activities and synergies are on schedule.\nMoving to Slide 9. We'd like to share some recent highlights on the integration. Key leaders from both Parker and Meggitt are leading over 20 teams that are creating a lot of value in integrating the functions. Engagement with the team members and the customers that had widespread activity in all locations and wind strategy training and implementation is well underway. Just to note here, we have a proven track record of delivering synergy targets, and this acquisition will be the same. The teams are following the integration playbook that has been developed over the last several acquisitions, and I am sure they will add some new best practices to it as well.\nSlide #10. So we are on track to achieve the $60 million in synergies by the end of this fiscal year, and the graph on the left illustrates our path to $300 million in synergies and adjusted EBITDA margins of 30% by FY '26. Synergies are represented in blue and the cumulative costs to achieve are in gold. On the right side of this page, this quadrant depicts the use of the overall Win strategy to achieve the synergies and ensure operational excellence into the future. Starting with the top left, Safety, Lean, Kaizen, high-performance teams all make up our brand of Kaizen and will drive the engagement and continuous improvement well into the future.\nSimplification is a major area of focus for the integration teams. This is where we look at structure and org design. We use our 80-20 complexity reduction tool, and we implement simple by design principles. All of this drives real ownership and decision-making at the division level, further empowering the team to drive results.\nMoving over to SG&A. We've had the realization that there's a lot of opportunity moving Meggitt from a centralized structure to Parker's decentralized structure, driving that overall decision-making to the local level and improving overall speed. With this acquisition, footprint optimization is very minor. Remember, we have complementary technologies with this acquisition and not a lot of overlap at the plant level. And with supply chain we will optimize pricing, terms and conditions, direct and indirect material spends as well as logistics. Again, off to a great start, very pleased with the performance on quarter end.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Todd for a summary of our Q2 results.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Jenny. That was great. Okay. So I'm going to begin on Slide 12 with the financial results. I can't tell you how excited the team is. This is the first full quarter that includes Meggitt in our results. It also is the first full quarter that we do not have aircraft wheel and brake in our results. So the year-over-year comparisons are a little bit more complicated than usual.\nBut you see the top line sales increased 22% versus prior year. That clearly is a record for us at $4.7 billion. Organic growth continues to be extremely healthy and was just over 10% in the quarter. That does extend our string of double-digit organic growth quarters. Although better than forecasted, the currency headwinds do continue. The currency impact to sales was unfavorable by 4% in the quarter versus prior year. And when you look at the net of the Meggitt acquisition and the aircraft Wheel and Brake divestiture, that was a positive 16% to our sales in the quarter.\nLooking at adjusted segment operating margin, we exceeded our forecast, and we finished at 21.5%. And if you look at adjusted EBITDA margins, that was even stronger at 22.4%. And just as a reminder, we mentioned this last quarter, we do expect Meggitt to be just slightly dilutive to overall margins in this first stub-years as we generate those synergies that Jenny just spoke to.\nLooking at adjusted net income, we did $619 million or 13.2% ROS. That is an improvement of 6% versus prior year, and adjusted earnings per share were $4.76. That's a Q2 record and an increase of $0.30 or 7% compared to the prior year. Overall for Q3, we are extremely happy to have that first quarter of Meggitt in the books to see that sales increase by 22% and obviously, see the positive net income and EPS growth. So just really happy with the results of the quarter.\nIf we jump to Slide 13. This is just going to be the visual elements of that $0.30 EPS improvement and again, I'm really happy to say the driver of this is the additional segment operating income. We generated $180 million or 22% additional segment operating income versus the prior year. If you look at that, that added $1.8 to EPS for the quarter. Interest expense, as expected, is a headwind. It's a $0.51 headwind. That was a little bit higher than we were expecting just with the movement in rates, 100% of that entire $0.51 is related to the Meggitt transaction and what's going on in the rate environment. Other expense was $0.12 unfavorable. That was primarily driven by year-over-year changes in currency rates and income tax is a drag of $0.14, really because last year benefited from a number of discrete items that were favorable. And of course, this year, we have some of these transaction costs in the quarter that are not deductible. Everything else nets to just $0.01. And if you look at all those items, that makes up our $0.30 increase to that record $4.76 earnings per share, and we're really happy with that.\nIf you jump to Slide 14 and just looking at the segments, once again, every segment was positive organic growth in the quarter. We exceeded our margins across the board. Every segment exceeded our expectations on margins. Orders remain positive despite some pretty tough comps in the prior year and for the total company finished at plus 3. And really, demand does remain robust across all the markets we serve. Our team members really are working hard to meet customer expectations. And the result is that record sales that we just generated in the second quarter. If you look specifically at the North American businesses, Sales are extremely strong at $2.1 billion. Organic growth in that segment is 13.5%. Adjusted operating margins did increase 50 basis points in North America. They finished at 21.8%, that is a record and just really healthy volumes and gradually improving supply chain really helped drive performance in those North American businesses.\nOrder rates are positive at plus 2 and that really matches our strong backlog and really that broad-based demand that is consistent across North America. So special thanks to our team members in North America for their record performance.\nLooking at the international businesses, sales were $1.4 billion. Organic growth there, almost 9% from prior year. And across all of our regions in the International segment, we were positive from an organic growth standpoint. Margins remained high at 21.9%. This is slightly down from prior year, really due to currency, a little bit of product mix and some China COVID-related headwinds, just specifically in China. Order rates are minus 4. They were positive last quarter, but that did have a bit of a rebound, if you remember, from the COVID-related shutdowns in China. So we're watching that very closely.\nAerospace Systems, obviously, huge sales, up 84%. They did exceed $1 billion for the first time, and that obviously is clearly driven by the addition of the Meggitt businesses in our Aerospace Systems segment. Organic growth in Aerospace was almost 5%. Really strong OEM and MRO commercial activity in that segment, both from sales and orders being mid-teen positive on the OEM side of it and military OEM remains negative as we expected. Operating margins were 20.6% in that segment. That is up 70 basis points from last quarter and better than we forecasted. And really, the Meggitt integration, the performance of the businesses, the synergies, like Jenny had mentioned, totally on track, and we're really happy with that. When you look at Aerospace orders, they are plus 22%. We talked for the last couple of quarters about that bad comp we had with the military orders we've now -- we've passed that comp. So you can see the orders are 22%. We're really happy with that. Great performance across all of the businesses this quarter. Great job, everyone.\nIf we go to Slide 15, this is just cash flow. This is our performance on a year-to-date basis. The mega transaction, we've talked about this last quarter, there's a drag to cash flow just based on some of those transactions costs. They did impact CFOA and free cash flow by roughly 2%. But even excluding that, if you look at the numbers as reported, cash flow from operations is 12.1% of sales. We did surpass $1 billion in cash flow from operations on a year-to-date basis and our free cash flow is 10% of sales. Our CapEx, as we have communicated, just slightly over 2% for the year, and free cash flow conversion is 114%. I think everyone knows us pretty well. Our cash flow is always second half weighted and we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations and certainly, free cash flow conversion over 100% for the full year.\nIf we jump to Slide 16, just a few comments on capital deployment. I think everyone saw that last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend payout of $1.33 per share. That is our 291st consecutive quarterly dividend, and it is certainly in line with those targets that Jenny mentioned earlier.\nOn leverage, we did make progress on reducing our leverage. If you look at gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, that was 3.6. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.4. Both of those metrics improved 0.2 turns from Q1. So that EBITDA is on a trailing 12-month basis. And just a reminder, that only includes Meggitt EBITDA from the date of close, so roughly 3.5 months of mega EBITDA. And I'm proud to say we've now applied over $2.2 billion of cash towards that Meggitt transaction. And we're really fully committed to our deleveraging plan, and that plan remains on track. So good progress there.\nOkay. So moving to guidance on Slide 17. You saw we did increase our guidance this morning. We are providing this as usual, on an as reported and on an adjusted basis. And if you look at the sales range, we are increasing that. We're increasing the range from 14.5% to 16.5% or from, excuse me, 14.5% to 16.5% or 15.5% at the midpoint. More importantly, organic growth, if you look at our organic growth for the full year, we are increasing that to 7%. That is up 1% from 6% last quarter. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We're moving that up just slightly to 11.5%. That was 11% last quarter. And while currency is still a headwind, we expect that to be less bad. We now forecast that to be a 3% impact to sales negative. And that's down from what we were forecasting last quarter at negative 4.5% and that is using spot rates as of December 31, like we normally do.\nWhen you look at adjusted segment operating margins for the full year, we are increasing that full year guide by 20 basis points to 22.1%, and that is at the midpoint, there's a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And just a few additional items to note. If you look at the interest expense, that is now up to $555 million. That was $510 million last quarter. That does include the changes in the interest rates that just were announced yesterday and really what we forecast them to do in the upcoming months.\nCorporate G&A is $204 million and other income is really an income of $18 million. Both of those numbers are virtually unchanged from our prior guide. If you look at our tax rate, just based on where we're at now, halfway through the year, we believe that will be 23.5% for the full year. And adjusted EPS is now raised to $19.45, that's a $0.50 increase from our prior guide and there is a range around that or plus or minus $0.25.\nSpecifically, for Q3, organic growth is expected to be nearly 4%. We raised that from our prior guide and adjusted EPS is expected to be $4.86 at the midpoint. And finally, adjustments in the forecast at a pretax level are listed here on this table for the remainder of the year, together with acquisition-related expenses incurred. So that's the details on guidance.\nIf you go to Slide 18, this is again just a little bridge on that. You can see where we start. Our prior guide was $18.95, that strong performance in Q2. We're rolling in that $0.45 beat. We are increasing segment operating income by $0.35 for the remainder of the second half. And I just wanted to note that $0.25 of that is due to the less bad currency rates. If you remember last quarter, we knocked that down a little bit based on where rates were at the end of September. We've now moved that back a little bit, and there's a little bit more based on the organic growth increases, and that is $0.35.\nInterest and tax still continue to be a bit of a headwind. You can see the interest expense is $0.20 headwind and income tax for the second half of the year is just $0.10. Add it all together, we get to $19.45 at the midpoint, and that is the changes to our guidance.\nSo with that slide, I will ask you to focus on Slide 19. Jenny, I will hand it back over to you for summary comments before we go to Q&A.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCEO & Director, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. So we have a very promising future. We have a highly engaged team that's living up to its purpose. We'll continue to accelerate our performance with Win Strategy 3.0. We are seeing the benefit of our strategic portfolio transformation, and we will continue to be great generators and deployers of cash.\nAnd with that, Chris, I think we're ready for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Parker's fiscal year 2023 Q1 earnings release webcast. As Jonathan said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. And joining me today is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; our Vice Chairman and President, Lee Banks; and our current Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer elect, Jenny Parmentier.\nWe will be addressing forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures today. Slide 2 provides details to our disclosure statement in these areas. Actual results could vary from our projections for the items listed in these forward-looking statements and also detailed in our SEC filings.\nThe presentation today will address non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations for those non-GAAP measures are available in this presentation and all of this is available on the Investors section at parker.com and will remain available for 1 year.\nTom is going to begin the call today with a couple of highlights on the quarter and also provide an update to the Meggitt integration. I'll follow with a brief summary on the financials and review the increase to our guidance that we issued this morning. And then we'll touch on the leadership transition that we announced last week, and we'll finish the call with Q&A.\nSo if I could ask you to reference Slide 3, and I'll hand it over to Tom to begin.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today.\nWe had an impressive first quarter of 7 -- first quarter record sales, net income, EPS and several margin records. And we closed the Meggitt acquisition, which was a big accomplishment. So if you look at this slide, the first bullet, safety is our top priority. We leveraged the high-performance teams, Lean and Kaizen.\nWe had a 17% reduction in incidents versus the prior year. If you look at that on a safety incident rates, there would be a number of incidents per 100 team members, that will put us in the top quartile versus our proxy peer group, which is fantastic results.\nSales were $4.2 billion, an increase of 12% versus the prior year. Organic was very strong at a plus 14% versus the prior, and we had strength across all regions and segments. Segment operating margin was 19.8% as reported or 22.7% adjusted. We had a 70-basis-point improvement versus prior year, again, excellent improvement in pretty tough conditions.\nAs I mentioned, we completed the Meggitt acquisition integration, is well underway. We're off to a good start. I'll talk more about that in a second. So if you look at the quarter and really the last several years, is that takeaway that you see in this slide, The Win Strategy, the Portfolio Changes working together to deliver record performance.\nGo to Slide 4, some pictures from day 1. We showed you some of these in our last call, but it was a great day 1. We had Parker executives at every Meggitt site globally, 34 sites around the world. Very positive meetings, and we're off to a good start putting these two companies together.\nIf you go to Slide 5, I went through this in a fair amount of detail on the September 28 investor call, but just to orientate you on the page on the left-hand side, the blue bars of the synergies, gold is cost achieved. This is by fiscal year, it shows you the walk to a $300 million worth of synergies in FY '26. That would take us to approximately 30% adjusted EBITDA margin over a period of time, so a significant improvement in profitability.\nOn the right-hand side, is really the how, how we'll get to $300 million synergies. And again, I went through that in a lot of detail. Suffice it to say, it all sits underneath the umbrella of The Win Strategy. Those four boxes that you see underneath there. And we've had -- we're now 7 weeks into it. I've had a chance to spend time with the teams. I feel very good about our ability to deliver these synergies.\nIf you go to Slide 6, really, the combination of the portfolio changes that we've made so the doubling of Filtration, doubling of Engineered Materials and the doubling of Aerospace over the last 8 years. If you put that together with our technology offering, which is very much aligned to the secular trends of today and the future aerospace, digital, electrification and clean technologies, that combination is going to have a profound shift in our sales mix. And that's what you see illustrated on these pie charts at the bottom here.\nSo if you look at where we were in FY '15 and you go out to FY '27 on an illustrative basis, you'd see we have 85% of the company, either industrial aftermarket or a longer cycle. That mix shift is what has allowed us to change our FY '27 target on growth to grow 4% to 6% organically over the cycle.\nGo to Slide 7. If I was only allowed one slide on these earnings calls, this would probably the slide I could show it up. It demonstrates that the company is distinctively different and better over quite a period of time here. So on the left is adjusted EPS, and we've updated that for the FY '23 guide, you see the $18.95 at the midpoint. And the adjusted EBITDA margins on the right-hand side, an almost 800-basis-point improvement over this period of time.\nThis slide really speaks for itself. It's hard to make metrics go at a 45-degree angle to the right, but it's a fantastic job by our people, portfolio changes and the strategy of the company. Arguably, the most improved industrial company over this period of time and a great company to invest in.\nAnd with that, I'm going to hand it over to Todd to talk more about the quarter.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThanks, Tom. I'm going to start on Slide 9. Obviously, it was an impressive quarter. Tom mentioned that. It's a really strong start to our fiscal year. And our team members just really globally continue to execute and deploy The Win Strategy, and we're very proud of the results that they were able to put up.\nTom mentioned this, but sales are up 12.5% versus the prior year. That was a record of $4.2 billion. The organic growth in Q1 was extremely strong, 14%. Everyone is seeing the strengthening of the dollar, and that has created a currency headwind for us. That's about 5.5% of sales. And we're very happy that we closed Meggitt. We also closed the Aircraft Wheel and Brake divestiture. All in, net of that, it added 4% to our sales for the quarter.\nAdjusted segment operating margins, 22.7%. That's an increase of 70 basis points from prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 23.3%. That's an even bigger increase. That's a 120 basis points up from prior year. And really, this year-over-year margin, both the adjusted segment operating margins and the EBITDA margin improvements, really just demonstrate the power of Win Strategy 3.0.\nWhen you look at adjusted net income, the number is $616 million, that's a 14.5% ROS. Adjusted earnings per share is $4.74. That is a Q1 record. It's up $0.48 from prior year, and that's really despite some currency headwinds that we saw in the quarter. Both adjusted net income and earnings per share have increased 11% versus prior year.\nI would say -- I just want to make a couple of notes. There were a number of several onetime items incurred this quarter as a result of the Meggitt acquisition and the Wheel and Brake divestiture. We've included a reconciliation to all those items in the appendix. Those are mostly over but some large onetime items. And I really want to thank our global finance and accounting teams for getting all this done with just 2 weeks of ownership and closing the quarter really well. So all in, this is a really a fantastic start to our fiscal year.\nIf you go to Slide 10, this is just a bridge on the year-over-year EPS improvement. I've already mentioned it, but the strong Q1 operating performance, obviously, the main driver there. We generated $133 million or 16% additional segment operating income Q1 versus Q1 last year. That equated to $0.80 of the earnings per share improvement. Incrementals were extremely strong, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Total company did about 36% incrementals.\nWhen you look at everything else, the net of corporate G&A, other tax and shares outstanding, all of that nets to $0.03. And you can see the big line there, interest expense is $0.35 headwind. But 100% of that is related to the Meggitt acquisition, and we knew that, that was going to be a headwind. So all in, that's $4.74, that's 11% increase from prior year.\nIf we go to Slide 11, just looking at the segments, you can see organic growth, again, very strong in the quarter. Orders remained positive in every segment, despite some notably tough comps versus prior year. Total company orders are up 5%, and we continue to see broad-based demand across all the end markets that we serve.\nStrong incrementals drove that margin expansion, that 70-basis-point margin expansion versus prior year. And again, our team members just really continued to be agile in the current environment, and I'm very proud that they were able to generate record sales and operating margins.\nLooking at North America, the organic growth was extremely strong in North America. Nearly 18% sales came in at $2.1 billion, significant margin expansion, 200 basis points over prior year, that reached 23.4%. Volumes obviously were a big driver here. But again, we've talked over the last couple of quarters about the specific regional supply chain challenges. Our team has just been very resilient, working on our operational efficiencies, and that really is the main driver on driving this strong margin performance.\nIncrementals in North America, ex acquisitions, was 38%. Orders are positive at plus 3. And again, just operating in all cylinders in North America broad-based demand.\nLooking at the international businesses. Organic growth, again, strong there at 12% organic growth. Sales reached $1.4 billion. Organic growth was positive low to mid-teens in every region in our international businesses. And adjusted operating margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year and reached 23.1%. And again, that's all in light of some currency headwinds that obviously more heavily impact this segment.\nOur Asia Pacific team continues to outperform. We've talked about that. They have done a great job recovering from those shipment delays that were a result of COVID shutdowns, and we feel that, that is kind of mostly played out in Q1 here. Orders are positive in the international business to plus 6. And that clearly reflects a rebound, obviously, from China as well.\nLooking at Aerospace Systems. Sales are $746 million now. That's obviously up 26%. If you remember, about 82% of the Meggitt transaction does get reported in this segment. There's about $150 million of sales for Meggitt in Q1 in our Aerospace Systems segment. That makes up 19.5% of the sales increase. But if you look at organic growth, very strong there as well, 7.4%. We just continue to see a strong OEM and MRO commercial volumes continuing throughout the year.\nWhen you look at operating margins, that was impacted really by Meggitt coming in, Wheel and Brake coming out and then there were some nonrecurring program timing charges that were in respect to our OEM business. So all in, that's a onetime issue, and we don't see that continuing going forward.\nIf you look at Aerospace orders on a 12-month rolling basis, it's plus 5. But you remember, we've talked about these multiyear military orders. That will anniversary next quarter if we adjust for that, orders were positive 29% in Aerospace. And Aerospace dollars continue to remain at extremely high levels. So all in, great performance across all of our segments. We're really happy with the way the team has outperformed there.\nLooking at cash, another good story here. If you look at our cash flow from operations, that was 10.8% of sales. Free cash flow was 8.8% of sales. Our CapEx did hit 2% as we have been signaling and free cash flow conversion was 96%. The transaction costs that we've talked about did impact CFOA and free cash flow pretty significantly in the quarter, it's about 450 basis points of impact. Those will minimize as we go on throughout the year, but I just wanted to call it out that, that was a drag in our Q1 cash flow. We do still expect free cash flow for the year to be in the mid-teens, so no worries on that.\nOn Slide 13, I just want to give you a couple of updates on the capital deployment. I'm sure everyone has seen this. Last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend payout of $1.33 per share. That is our 290th consecutive quarterly dividend payment and our record of continuing to increase the dividends paid is now at 66 years.\nAnd I want to address leverage because I know that's a number that's been on people's mind. At the end of Q1, leverage now reflects all Meggitt-related debt for the transaction. If you look at our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA at 3.8%, net debt is 3.6%. And those numbers are presented on a trailing 12-month basis, and they do not include any Meggitt pre-closed EBITDA. So that is basically base Parker adjusted EBITDA, doesn't really include any Meggitt EBITDA, and we fully expect that to improve as we go throughout the year and we start to include that Meggitt EBITDA.\nWe are fully committed to our delevering plan, and I'm really proud to say since we made this announcement last August or really August of 2021, we've applied over $2 billion of cash towards the purchase price of Meggitt. So great work on that.\nOkay. Looking at guidance, you saw this. We are now including the Meggitt acquisition, and we are excluding the Wheel and Brake divestiture in our guidance. We're providing this on an as-reported and an adjustment basis. And Tom mentioned this, we're increasing the sales growth range now to a range of 11% to 14% or 12.5% at the midpoint. Organic growth forecast has been increased to 6% at the midpoint.\nAcquisitions net of that divestiture is going to be plus 11. And we do see currency being a larger headwind now. We are now increasing that unfavorable impact of currency of 4.5% and that is using spot rates as of September 30.\nWhen you look at adjusted segment operating margins, the range is now 21.7 to 22.1 or 21.9% at the midpoint. So that is all-in, includes Meggitt and excludes Wheel and Brake obviously, our strong Q1 performance.\nJust a few other items to note. On an adjusted basis, corporate G&A is expected to be $207 million. Interest expense, that's all in, including everything from Meggitt is $510 million. And the other income expense line is actually going to be income of $23 million for us. Really no change to the tax rate. We expect that to be 23%.\nAnd you can see the full year as reported EPS is now $13.20 at the midpoint or $18.95 adjusted and there's a range of $0.35 on either side of that. And just looking a little bit more forward into Q2, we see adjusted EPS to be $4.46 (sic) [$4.31] at the midpoint for our second quarter.\nLastly, all the adjustments that we've been talking about on a pretax level are listed in this table, which now includes at least the current estimate we have for the Meggitt-related intangible amortization of 220. So you can see the total is now 520. And it also includes integration costs to achieve, specifically for Meggitt of $70 million for the remainder of the year.\nEspecially with the acquisition expense to date, we've adjusted for all of those. The majority of those are over, but we will adjust those as they come through.\nOkay. Last, on the guidance bridge, let me just give you some details to that. Obviously, we started the year with our initial guidance of $18.50. We had the call at the end of September, which included Meggitt and excluded Wheel and Brakes. So that was another $0.33 of additional EPS that we saw for the year that got us to the $18.83.\nReally our strong Q1, there's a little bit of moving pieces here because of Meggitt coming in and Wheel and Brake coming out. We calculate that to be about a $0.54 beat to our original guide. And for the remainder of the year, we've really increased the Q2 organic growth just slightly, and we've held the second half to exactly what we said in our original guidance.\nWe have incorporated the recent currency rates and their estimated impact on the segment operating income. Right now, we feel like that's a $0.42 headwind. Really, there's nothing else notably changed to our guide for the full year. And all in, we increased our full year adjusted EPS guide to $18.95 at the midpoint.\nSo with that, I'll hand it back to you, Tom, and it's all yours.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd.\nSo on Slide 16, we've got the leadership transition. As you saw last week, we announced several leadership changes. In coordination with the Board, I have been planning my transition for many years. I happen to be turning 64 years old tomorrow. It's my birthday. So my early birthday present is my last earnings call. So I've been CEO for 8 years and believe this is the right time to step down from the CEO position effective end of this calendar year.\nI've always had 8 years in my mind. I've used kind of the 2-term US President as kind of the length of tenure that I thought felt about right. And so now is the right time for me to step aside. To help facilitate a smooth transition, I plan to continue as Executive Chairman from January 1 of next year to December 31, 2023. At which time, I plan to intend to retire from Parker and the Board.\nIt's truly been an honor to lead this great company. And if you'll indulge me, I have a few thank yous I wanted to mention. First, our shareholders that are listening in. Thank you for the confidence you've shown me to lead the company on your behalf. My thanks to the Parker Board of Directors for just great advice counsel not just to me, but to our management team.\nTo the analysts who pretty soon are going to ask me lots of questions. Thank you for an open and constructive and a transparent relationship. I've known a number for many years. I've always appreciated the relationship. To all the Parker team members, just incredible people who take ownership in everything that they do. It's our culture, it's our people that are the secret behind our success. To the Parker leadership team. Without a doubt, the best leadership team that I've had a chance to work with. It's a very deep and talented team that our shareholders take a look to create comfort in.\nAnd to the office of Chief Executives, people who are sitting around the table with me today, Lee, Jenny, Todd and now Andy, thank you for helping me to lead the company. Business leadership is a team sport, and I appreciate their help. And special thanks to Lee. For 19 years, we've been business partners. We talk to each other and together, we hope Parker to be a better company. I really appreciate that's Lee is going to continue on as Vice Chairman and President. Going into the new year, I think it's going to be a big help to the team.\nIf you go to Slide 17, one of the most important responsibilities of the Board and myself is CEO succession planning. As you saw, the Board elected Jenny Parmentier is our next CEO, effective January 1. Jenny will report to the Board of Directors and be a member of the Board as well. Jenny is currently Chief Operating Officer, has been a Group President Twice and General Manager twice. She's a great person and a great leader, proven track record of success, and I have complete confidence in Jenny to lead the company in the future.\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to Jenny to make a few comments and finish the presentation.\n\nJennifer A. Parmentier\n\nCOO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom. I am honored and proud to be appointed the next CEO of Parker Hannifin and very excited about our future. I'm grateful to both Tom and Lee for the support and mentorship over the last several years and to our Board of Directors for their confidence in my leadership.\nMoving to Slide 18. Effective January 1, this is the office of the Chief Executive. Lee, Todd and I have been part of this team for some time, and we welcome Andy to the role of Chief Operating Officer. Andy will report to Lee as I do now in my current role. This is a seasoned leadership team that has been part of the company's transformation and an integral part of developing and implementing Win Strategy 3.0. This team will continue to deliver record results well into the future.\nMoving to Slide 19. As I look to the new calendar year and the second half of our fiscal year, my priority is to build upon the success of Parker's transformation. We are focused on integrating Meggitt into the Parker family, achieving the synergies we've committed to and delivering a record FY '23. Win Strategy 3.0 will continue to accelerate our performance across the company and our portfolio transformation, coupled with the secular growth trends, makes us more than confident in achieving our FY '27 goal.\nBefore we go back to Todd for Q&A, Lee has a few comments.\n\nLee C. Banks\n\nVice Chairman & President, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. I know everybody is anxious to get to Q&A. We're going to get there quickly, but we've got one more thank you to have happened here. So Tom, on behalf of 60,000-plus teammates around the world, our management team and really from myself, thank you for 8 exceptional years as leadership and our Chief Executive Officer.\nWhen you came into that role, you had a great vision. And you boil that vision down to 3 key deliverables. You said we're going to be the safest company in the industry, and we're going to have the highest engaged team that thinks and acts like an owner. Since your time in office, we've reduced our incident rate by 73%, and we annually qualify and measure as one of the top engaged workforces amongst our peers.\nYou mentioned it in your slides earlier, you drove us to be a top quartile financial performer. Nearly 800 basis points increase in EBITDA margin during your time and a 2.7x increase in adjusted earnings per share. And lastly, I remember us talking about this, we're going to be great generators and great deployers of cash.\nExcluding today's numbers, your time and office, we've increased the enterprise value of this company by $30 billion, $48.8 billion. Total shareholder return, not including today, 180%. And dividend increase, quarterly dividend increase, a 111% increase from $0.63 to $1.33. Capital deployed during this time period, $25 billion. But I think most importantly, Tom, is you're leaving us with the company, not only in management, talent but portfolio. It's structured to have its best days ahead of it. So with that, thank you very much.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nLee C. Banks\n\nVice Chairman & President, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nAnd now we'll turn it over to Todd.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nShould I have retired sooner?\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nAll right. Jonathan, we're going to go to Q&A. I'll let Tom catch his breath here a little bit, but I want to make one clarification. I called out an incorrect number on our Q2 EPS. I read last year's number. The number that we're looking for, for FY '23, Q2 was $4.31 at the midpoint.\nSo with that, Jonathan, we are ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to you."

Welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Parker's fiscal year 2022 Q4 earnings release webcast. As Carmen said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer, speaking. And as usual, with me today are Tom Williams, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, Vice Chairman and President.\nToday, our discussion will address forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 of the presentation provides details to our disclosure statement in these areas. Actual results may differ from our projections due to uncertainties listed in these forward-looking statements and detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP measures, along with this presentation, have been made available under the Investors section at parker.com and will remain available for 1 year.\nIn respect to the Meggitt transaction, while we expect this transaction to close in Q1 of fiscal year 2023, that's our current quarter, we are still down by the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code in respect to discussing certain details. We do plan to hold an investor call shortly after the close to provide expanded color on the transaction once the regulations allow.\nFor the call today, we'll start with Tom discussing the fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2022 full year results. And I'll follow with a brief financial summary and review some of the assumptions around our initial fiscal 2023 guidance that we issued this morning. After that, we'll finish the call with the Q&A section for any questions you have for Tom, Lee or myself.\nSo with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you and ask everyone to refer to Slide #3.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everybody, and let me welcome everybody as well to the call.\nStarting with Slide 3. We had a great quarter. It was absolutely a dynamite record performance, great execution by the team around the world. The first two bullets really is what drove our success. Safety has always been our top priority. We're leveraging high-performance teams. Think of that as how we are organized around the world and how we engage and involve our people. Lean is how we run the factories and Kaizen is our culture of continuous improvement in how we go about making things better.\nWe also just conducted our 2022 engagement survey. We were able to capture over 90% participation of our people around the world, asked them questions around empowerment and engagement. And we got great results. We got results that put us in the top 8% of industrial companies. And it's really these first two bullets that's driving an ownership culture within the company, driving an ownership of results and our business performance.\nGoing down to the third bullet, sales were $4.2 billion. It's an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Organic growth was 10% versus the prior year, so excellent quarter organically.\nSegment operating margins was 20.9% as reported or 22.9% adjusted. So that's a 70 basis points better than prior year. This is really excellent margin expansion in the face of all the challenges that you're fully aware of, supply chain inefficiencies, inflation, and of course, the China COVID lockdowns.\nSo just really outstanding performance in a very difficult environment. Lots of records and my thanks to the global team for all their hard work.\nIf we move to Slide 4, talking about the full year, came in at $15.9 billion in sales, 12% organic growth versus the prior year. So a really big year for us organically. Record segment operating margin, 20.1% as reported or 22.3% adjusted. That was 120 basis points better than the prior year. It really speaks to the robustness and the agility of our business model. Operating cash flow was $2.4 billion, and that represented 15.4% of sales. So a mid-teens CFOA with growing sales, which was very commendable.\nAnd then, of course, all of you hopefully are aware we announced our FY '27 targets in the March Investor Day, and I'll just summarize. It was bigger growth, bigger margins, bigger cash flow targets, and we're confident in our ability to get there in the future. So a transformed company with a promising future.\nWhat drives us is on Slide 5. It's what's been driving us in the past, present and will drive us in the future. First is living up to our purpose, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. Being great generators of cash as evidenced by the mid-teens and CFOA that you saw, and great deployers of cash by our pending Meggitt acquisition. And then being a top quartile company and how we perform versus our peers.\nWhich really goes to Slide 6. What I'd like to show to this slide, it's updated now for FY '22 numbers. And really the reason for showing it is objective evidence that our company is significantly different, significantly better than it's been in the past.\nOn the left-hand side is adjusted EPS, and on the right-hand side is adjusted EBITDA margin. And I think the pace of improvement speaks for itself. You can look at this chart, everything is moving high into the right and it's really great progress.\nIn particular, if you look at '21 versus '22 on EPS, going from $15.04 to $18.72. That's a gain of $3.68. It's the largest year-over-year dollar gain we've had on EPS in the history of the company. So it was a 24% improvement.\nOn the right-hand side, almost 800 bps of EBITDA margin improvement, which is fantastic. And if you look at these two improvement trends side by side, arguably the most improved industrial company out there over this time period, and I'm hoping for the shareholders, a great company to invest in as well.\nGoing to Slide 7. I like the picture here, we're trying to symbolize that we're coming in for a landing here on Meggitt. We're close to the end. We expect to close sometime in Q1, our current quarter FY '23. The only remaining regulatory approval is the U.S. Department of Justice, which we expect to complete sometime in the quarter. And following the U.S. DOJ, it's customary to go to court in the U.K. to get final approval, which we expect also in the current quarter.\nThe timing here is perfect. We're adding a transformational acquisition, doubling aerospace at the beginning of a commercial aerospace recovery and with the synergies in front of us to help us grow the top line and the bottom line. And as Todd mentioned, we'll host a call after this closes to bring you up to date on Meggitt and to update our guidance.\nMoving to Slide 8. We're going to talk a lot in the Q&A about FY '23 sales guidance, I'm sure. But I wanted to highlight the future growth drivers that we talked about in the March Investor Day, these growth drivers remain intact. I'm just going to walk you briefly through the five columns that you see here.\nThe first is our business system, The Win Strategy. It's about the things we can do ourselves to grow differently organically. It's about innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth, incentive plan changes that we're making and simplify design.\nGo to the next column, the CapEx, changes that we expect over this time period, we think this will be a very constructive time for industrials. There's going to be a need to invest in supply chain development, tool sourcing, automation, all things that are going to be very helpful and needed to for Parker products.\nRegarding channel restocking, and particularly here, I'm referring to the distribution channel, it's improving, but there's still a ways to go. And I think our partners will probably be somewhat cautious as they add inventory. But as we go out the next several years, they're clearly not at the inventory levels they'd like to be, so that's additional tailwind.\nThe acquisitions are transformational. They've reshaped the portfolio, doubling filtration, doubling engineered materials, doubling our aerospace business once Meggitt closes and really reshaping the portfolio to be much more longer cycle, accretive, more resilient.\nAnd then our linkage to the secular trends around the world, aerospace, digital, electrifications and clean technologies are all going to help us grow it differently.\nSo there's targeted organic growth by FY '27, 4% to 6%. We think industrials and Parker in particular is going to be a very attractive space over the upcoming years.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Todd to talk more about the quarter.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tom.\nI'm going to start on Slide 10. This is just a year-over-year comparison of our Q4 financial results. And as Tom said, really proud of our team members for just delivering across-the-board record results against the backdrop of several continued global challenges.\nSo as Tom mentioned, the sales was up 6%. We did hit a record sales number of $4.2 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was double-digit at 10%. I think everyone is following these currency rates, the strong dollar drove currency headwinds for us. It was minus 4% impact to sales. Our backlog remains healthy. It did increase 21% versus the prior year, and over 90% of our markets are in growth phase. So we're very happy with that. Two markets to note, commercial aerospace and North American industrial markets are two that really remain very robust.\nAdjusted segment operating margin was 22.9% for the quarter. That's a 70 basis point increase versus the prior year. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.1%. That's a 100 basis point increase from prior year in the quarter. Both these margin numbers, segment operating and EBITDA margins, exited the year at the highest levels of our fiscal year. So really happy with the strong finish that the team put forth in Q4.\nWhen you move down to net income, adjusted net income was $671 million. That's a 16% ROS, which just also happens to be a 16% improvement from prior year. And again, I'll just note due to the continued strengthening of the dollar, specifically versus the pound, we did record a pretax noncash charge in the quarter for $619 million. That is related to the Meggitt deal-contingent currency contracts.\nAnd I just want to remind everyone that these contracts we entered into these contracts really to eliminate currency exchange rate risk associated with the purchase price of the Meggitt acquisition. And the total expected U.S. dollar outlay related to the transaction included in these contracts is neutral to the transaction consideration we announced last year.\nSo moving on to EPS. EPS is great, $5.16 on an adjusted basis, that is a record, It is an increase of $0.78 or $0.18 or 18% versus prior year, really strong results there. And I really just commend our team for the strong finish for the fiscal year.\nIf you move to Slide 11, this is just a bridge. This details some of those elements of the $0.78 improvement. We did generate 35% incremental margins. That was really aided by our margin expansion, but more significantly, just very solid execution across every one of our businesses.\nAdjusted segment operating income increased by $80 million or 9% versus the same quarter last year. That accounts for over 60% or $0.47 of the EPS improvement that we had in Q4.\nIf you net corporate G&A, interest expense and other, all that amounts to just $0.01 favorable. And we did have a few discrete tax settlements in the quarter. That drove a lower income tax expense, that did calculate to a $0.24 positive impact to EPS, and that was specifically in our fourth quarter.\nAnd then finally, just a slight reduction in the number of shares outstanding accounted for a favorable $0.06 to EPS. So all in, that's the 18% increase in adjusted EPS or our $5.16.\nIf you move to Slide 12, I'll talk a little bit about the segments. Across the board, very strong performance here, 35% incremental margins. We increased segment operating income really across the board, and it's really just nice to see positive organic growth in every segment. That growth continues to be very broad-based.\nOrders for the total company ended up positive 3%. And that really is against a backdrop of increasingly more challenging comps. And the team really remains agile in this current supply chain and inflationary environment. We're happy with our actions. It is materializing in results, in the financial statements and just really proud of all the effort that's going on here. All of this gives us performance or confidence in our performance that we will achieve our FY '27 targets that Tom mentioned, we just announced just back in March.\nSo if I jump into the businesses in North America, very strong organic growth, 15% versus prior year. Sales reached $2.1 billion, adjusted operating margins increased 40 basis points. Our North American team achieved 22.9% ROS. And really, we've talked about this all year. They continue to manage well through a more difficult regional supply chain environment, so just kudos to them.\nIncrementals in this segment was about 25%. So we're happy with that, with all the headwinds. And really, orders continue to impress at plus 10%. In the North American segment, our backlog is up 50% this prior year, and it did grow 5% sequentially from Q3.\nMoving on to international. International sales, $1.4 billion, organic growth just above 5% for that segment. Organic growth in EMEA and Latin America was mid-teens positive with Asia Pacific, mid-single digits negative. Obviously, that was driven by the shutdowns in China based on the COVID outbreak.\nBut margins, if you look at margins, margins were 22.4% and still increased 30 basis points from prior year despite all that -- all those challenges. And really just tremendous effort from our Asia Pacific team. We forecasted $100 million negative sales impact based on the shutdowns at the time we talked last quarter. The team really outachieved and that ended up being only a $50 million impact for the quarter, and it was really a strong month in June. So much appreciation to our super dedicated Asia Pacific team. They really went above and beyond to serve our customers.\nInternational order rates did inflect to a minus 4%, which did reflect some short-term impact from those shutdowns in China, but great overall performance by the international team.\nLooking at Aerospace, another strong quarter from Aerospace. This is the best organic growth and margin performance that, that segment has had all year. Sales were $676 million. Organic growth is about 8%. Commercial businesses in both the OEM and MRO markets are very, very strong. And the operational margins increased 260 basis points and finished at an impressive 24.2%.\nThose Q4 margins did benefit from a favorable mix, aftermarket mix and lower-than-expected NRE expenses that were really just due to some program timing.\nSo this is really a record margin performance for that segment, and I still note that we are still below pre-COVID sales levels. So we're very happy with the cost controls and the execution in our Aerospace business.\nA note on orders. Aerospace orders are showing flat. But if you remember, we've talked about this. We did have some very significant military orders that we booked in Q2 of our FY '22 and that continues to make our 12-year comparisons difficult. If we exclude those items, Aerospace orders were positive 24% for the quarter. And our Aerospace dollars in respect to orders continue to remain really strong. So overall, segment performance, very, very strong, and I'm proud of our teams. It's really a testament to our strategy and our purpose.\nSo if we jump to Slide 13, cash, we had an unbelievable cash flow generation quarter in Q4. It was really stellar. We did exceed the forecast that we gave at Investor Day for both cash flow from operations and free cash flow by about $100 million for the full fiscal year. Tom mentioned this, but we generated $2.4 billion in cash flow from ops. That was 15.4% of sales. Free cash flow was $2.2 billion or 13.9% of sales. And obviously, the conversion is 168%.\nWe really have been managing working capital very diligently throughout the year. As our year progressed, that use of working capital began to normalize across the company. If you look at this year, the change in working capital was a 1.6% of sales use of cash. If you're comparing that to prior year last year, that was a [1.0%] source of cash.\nSo we are very disciplined. Our teams are focused on generating top quartile cash flow performance and again, we're really confident that we can achieve that FY '27 target of 16%.\nJust a few comments on leverage at the end of the quarter. Gross debt to EBITDA was 4.7, net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.5. That increase from last quarter is really a result of our issuance of $3.6 billion of bonds that we will use to fund the Meggitt transaction. That cash is sitting in escrow. It is on our balance sheet listed as restricted cash. If we exclude that restricted cash, our net debt to EBITDA at the end of June was 2.0x. So happy with the reduction there. The spike is just really preparing for the Meggitt transaction.\nAnd just one final note on our strong cash flow performance. We've already used $1.5 billion of cash that we've generated this year to fund the Meggitt transaction. So we are really happy with our position on that and we're looking forward to getting to close and welcoming all the Meggitt team members into Parker-Hannifin.\nOkay. If we go to Slide 14, guidance, this is just some detail on the guidance we released this morning. As usual, we're providing this on an as reported and an adjusted basis. And I think everyone got this, but just to be very clear, while we expect that Meggitt transaction to close in this quarter, we have not included any sales or earnings in our guidance number.\nHowever, we have given you color on the interest expense that is already committed for Q1. And I'll give you some more color on that in a second. So no sales and earnings, just the Q1 interest that we have already committed to in our Q1.\nSo if you look at sales, reported sales growth for the year is forecasted to be flat to 3% and or 1.5% positive at the midpoint. Organic growth is obviously better than that. It's expected to be 3.5% at the midpoint with a range of 2% to 5% on that.\nAs usual, we're using currency rates as of June 30. We do forecast currency to be a headwind this year. It will be about a 2% headwind to sales versus the prior year. And as usual, if you look at the split, our sales are 48% first half, 52% in the second half.\nMoving on to segment operating margins. Our as reported segment operating margin guidance is 20.4%. On an adjusted basis, that's 22.5%. That's at the midpoint. We have a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And the split of segment operating income is 47% first half, 53% second half. We are forecasting incremental margins to be 30% for the full year.\nAnd just to give a little bit more clarity on a few additional items. Corporate G&A, we expect to be $204 million in FY '23. The interest related to the legacy company, so this is excluding Meggitt interest, is expected to be $228 million. And that Meggitt-related interest that will cover Q1 only is $42 million or roughly $0.25 of EPS. We will give you an updated interest expense number once we schedule that update call that we have post close on Meggitt.\nOther income and expense is expected to be $14 million and as usual, any acquisition-related expenses that are associated with the Meggitt transaction, we'll continue to book those as incurred. We're not going to guide for those, we will just adjust those out as they incurred.\nWe do expect the tax rate from continuing ops to be 23% next year, that is essentially what our continuing ops rate was this year. That does not include any discrete items that may be favorable or unfavorable.\nAnd finally, we expect full year EPS on an as-reported basis to be $16.53 at the midpoint or $18.50 adjusted. And the range on both of those figures is plus or minus $0.40. EPS is split 46% first half, 54% second half. And just a little color on Q1. We foresee Q1 adjusted EPS to be $4.13, and that's right at the midpoint. And then just a little color on those adjustments. It's really just the acquired intangible asset amortization, which is now $300 million, and expected business realignment charges of $35 million. So we tried to give a lot of color there. We hope that, that was helpful.\nSlide 15 might give a little bit more color. This is just the bridge and really, the highlights here. It's really just continued strength and demand across the board. Obviously, our productivity initiatives and our expectations across all of our operations, increase of segment operating income on a year-over-year basis. The total is $0.49 EPS of increase. And I just want to note that, that does include an estimated headwind of approximately $0.40 based on currency. So in a constant currency, obviously, that $0.49 would be $0.89, but we're incorporating that $0.40 currency headwind, so we get a $0.49 increase in segment operating margin.\nWhen you look at corporate G&A, that legacy interest and any other items, those are all forecasted to be favorable to prior, those actually help us by $0.09. And then again, that forecasted tax rate of 23% creates a $0.55 headwind compared to that lower tax rate that our actual rate was in FY '22.\nAnd I just would note there on that, our FY '22, we always have discretes. We don't try to forecast them because they move around so much. But our FY '22 did have a higher-than-normal amount of discrete items. So that's just a little color on there.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we've included that interest expense. You can see the bridge there. It's $0.25, it's $42 million. That is the Q1 amount only, and that's how we walk from our FY '22 finish to legacy $18.75, or including that $0.25 of Meggitt, $18.50.\nSo with that, that's my color on guidance. Tom, I'll hand it back to you and ask everyone to move to Slide 16.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nSo just to wrap things up before we open up Q&A. It was a record FY '22, probably easier to say what was not a record, there were so many records to speak of. A challenging environment, just my congratulations to the entire global team for just a job well done. It's been our people, the portfolio changes and the second bullet there, the changes we made on The Win Strategy specifically on Strategy 3.0 that have driven over this period of time 800 basis points, almost 800 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion.\nWe're positioned to perform well in FY '23, and it's really because of the remaining items you see on this page the last three bullets. The portfolio is dramatically different, reshaped from where it was in the past with Meggitt closing in this quarter. Very few companies are going to be in a position to add a great company tied to future growth and synergies that we will be able to do.\nAnd then we're positioned for growth with the secular trends, aero, digital, clean tech and electrification. So hopefully, you feel, as you've seen in our numbers, a transformed company with a promising future.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Carmen to open up to Q&A."

Welcome to the Parker Hannifin Corporation's Fiscal Year 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now it is my pleasure to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining. This is our fiscal year 2022 Q3 earnings release webcast. As Paul said, this is Todd Leombruno. I am Chief Financial Officer. And as usual, with me today are Tom Williams, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President.\nToday, we are going to discuss forward-looking projections and also, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 in our deck details our disclosure statement on these areas. Actual results may differ from our projections due to uncertainties listed in these forward-looking statements, and those are detailed in all of our SEC filings. Reconciliations for all the non-GAAP measures, along with this presentation, have been made available under the Investors section on parker.com, and those will remain available for 1 year.\nI'd like to remind everyone before we begin that we are still bound by the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code in respect to discussing certain details of the pending Meggitt transaction.\nAs for the call today, as usual, we'll start with Tom discussing some key items for the quarter. I'll follow up with some additional color on our Q3 results and detail the increase to our guide that we issued this morning with all of our press releases. We'll finish the call with any questions you have for Tom, Lee or myself.\nAnd with that, we are now on Slide 3. And Tom, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Welcome, everybody, to the call today. Appreciate your participation.\nIt was a record quarter, record quarter for the quarter and record quarter for all time in a lot of key metrics and was delivered against very difficult circumstances that required exceptional agility and performance by our global team.\nI know we all lived through it, but just as a refresher of what happened in Q3, we had the Omicron spikes, which drove absenteeism; we had supply chain challenges; inflation; China COVID shutdowns; and the Ukraine war. So just your basic average quarter. Obviously, I'm being sarcastic, but obviously, not ideal conditions. And what was remarkable against that backdrop, we turned in a number of all-time records, as I mentioned. And my thanks to the entire team for this great performance and resilience in these times.\nSo a couple of comments about the quarter on Slide 3. Safety is our top priority. We continue to be top quartile when you look at our performance on safety incidents versus our peers. We're doing that through our high-performance teams, which is how we run the factories and the warehouses, and a culture of Kaizen. And as I've mentioned before to shareholders, there's a very strong linkage between safety, engagement and business performance. If you look at those 3 metrics for us over the last 7 years, they're all going in the same direction.\nOur sales growth was 9% versus the prior year. Organic was a positive 11%, so that was very nice. We eclipsed $4 billion in sales for the first time in the history of the company, first time over $4 billion in a quarter. That was a great milestone. We had strong demand against virtually all of our end markets. Segment operating margin was 20.3% as reported or 22.7% adjusted. That was 130 basis points better than prior year. So expanded margins, 130 basis points in the kind of conditions that I started the call with, just remarkable performance.\nWe increased the quarterly dividend 29%. That is the largest increase in our history and clearly signals the confidence that we have about Parker for the future. We have some temporary things, which we highlighted in the future slides here, that Todd will go over about the Q4 impact related to China COVID shutdowns. The comment here I just want to make is that that's a temporary thing. How long it goes, it's hard to predict, but we expect to come up to full production sometime in Q1, and that will make up this delta that we're experiencing to Q4 during the course of the rest of FY '23.\nAnd maybe to clarify, if you're looking at our -- what we're talking about China versus what some of our peers are, we only have 60 days left in our fiscal year. So it's very hard for us to make that up in rest of the fiscal year, but we clearly feel confident that we'll make it up in FY '23.\nIf you look at these results, it's the Win Strategy, as the portfolio changes, it's the fact that the company is now much longer cycle and a better performing company.\nOn Slide 4, what drives us is really 3 things: living up to our purpose, which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow; being great generators and deployers of cash; and being a top-quartile performer. And I want to give you one example on Slide 5, probably our purpose in action related to clean technologies. As the world migrates to a more carbon-friendly environment and applications, we're going to be there to help. One very topical and current area given the inflation pressures in the Russia-Ukraine war is the topic of energy and the availability of energy and inflation of energy prices around the world.\nAnd as the world moves from brown sources of energy to greener sources of energy, it's pretty clear that we're going to need to use all shades of color between brown to green as we walk to that cleaner tomorrow. And clearly, a big part of that bridge to that cleaner tomorrow is going to be natural gas. And we wanted to talk about really natural gas, where we play in it, and just how we're going to be able to help society, our purpose and action here.\nSo upstream -- there's 4 main components here: upstream, midstream, liquefaction, storage and regasification and power generation. On the bottom of this slide, you see the 6 Parker technologies that we utilize to go into there and a couple of anecdotal comments for each one. So in upstream, we've got fluid power controls for the rig equipment. We have instrumentation. Valves and controls in there as well. And midstream is primarily gas filtration. On the liquefaction, storage and regasification, that will be our pumps, our valves, ceiling technologies, glucan vance. And this is all under cryogenic conditions, so ultra-low temperatures. And then power gen, I'm going to cover on the next slide.\nSo a lot of what we do for society on compressed natural gas and liquid natural gas is going to be directly applicable as the world moves to hydrogen, which is on Slide 6. So that last value chain as part of natural gas that incurred was the power generation piece. And clearly, what's obvious here and what's really helpful for us, and I think our customers, is all the technologies that we have on CNG and LNG are directly applicable into hydrogen. You can see in the middle of the page, the applications, those 5 bullets we have in the middle.\nOn the right-hand side are our various technologies and similar technologies for both fuel sources. With the exception of our sealing technology, will need to be even more sophisticated and which we're working on as we speak to be able to seal hydrogen, which is a smaller molecule and more difficult to seal. But we'll be a big part of this bridge with natural gas, and we'll be there to help when society's ready for hydrogen as well.\nIf you go to Slide 7, which happens to be one of my favorite slides. And while you may be tired of me showing this slide, I think it's the simplest way for shareholders and people that maybe aren't familiar with us to understand how different the company is over the last 7 years. It's been our people, which is really their engagement, their ownership, those top-quartile results that we see from our people driving top-quartile performance. So in the portfolio, and I would just summarize it, we're going to -- when we close Meggitt, we will deploy $20 billion of money into acquisitions, reshaping the portfolio. We will have doubled engineered materials, doubled aerospace and doubled our filtration businesses over this period of time, dramatically reshaping the company and the future of the company.\nAnd then on the strategy side, you have the Win Strategy 2.0 and 3.0 now over this period of time. And you've seen what it's done to margins. EPS are just phenomenal. This is high into the right type of metrics on this page, which is hard to do. I can assure you that. So hopefully, you see from this progress, in addition to the alignment we have with the positive secular trends in aerospace, digital electrification and clean tech, that our business is poised for a very promising future over the next 5 years.\nI wanted to close my opening comments with giving you an update on Slide 8 with where we stand with the regulatory clearances regarding to the Meggitt transaction. So on the antitrust side, we have already cleared without any conditions from the following countries: so Australia, China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Turkey. Brazil has given us unconditional approval subject to their usual 15-day waiting period, so that's in good shape. We've received conditional antitrust clearance from the European Commission, subject to our commitment to divest of our aircraft mill and brake business, which is in process. And then on the foreign investment side of things, the transaction has been cleared by Australia, Denmark, Germany and Italy. So probably the simplest way for me to describe it, what remains and what's left are antitrust clearances for the U.S. and the U.K. and the national security clearances for the U.K. and France.\nSo we're making good progress, and we continue to expect the transaction will close sometime during Q3 of this calendar year. And we're very excited. We're going to put 2 great companies together. We're going to double the size of aerospace, and we're going to have great synergies as we work together. And we're going to do all this at the beginning of an aerospace recovery, so the timing is perfect.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Todd to give you more details on the quarter.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tom. I'm going to start on Slide 10. This is just a year-over-year comparison of our Q3 financial results. And Tom mentioned this, really all the credit goes to our team members, really demonstrating stellar execution to generate a number of record results in a quarter that, as Tom mentioned, had a lot of disruptions.\nSales increased 9%. We did eclipse $4 billion for the first time in our history. Organic growth was 11%. Currency was a drag at 2 points. So that's how we get to the 9% growth.\nI just want to make a comment. Our backlog levels are unbelievably strong. They're up 25% from this time last year, and over 90% of our end markets are in growing state. We continue to see all regions perform extremely well. Commercial aerospace and really all of the North American markets are really the most robust, but it is broad-based across the company.\nTom mentioned this, but we did expand segment operating margins, 130 basis points in the quarter. We finished at 22.7% on an adjusted basis. And I'll go through the segments in a couple of slides, but really, every segment, every region contributed to this performance. The inflationary and supply chain issues, they are persistent. They remain. Yet our team members are really showing their resiliency as we leverage the Win Strategy to really achieve our goal, which is top-quartile performance.\nWhen you look at EBITDA, our EBITDA margins expanded 70 basis points. We finished at 22.6 for the quarter. And net income -- adjusted net income grew by 16% in the quarter, and we finished at $630 million or 15.4% return on sales. Net income grew 16% versus prior year. Very, very impressive.\nI think we've mentioned this multiple times before, but Tom was talking about Meggitt. The currency deal contingent hedge we have, pound to dollar, requires mark-to-market accounting treatment. Due to what's going on with currency rates and really the strengthening of the dollar versus the pound, we did record a pretax noncash charge in the quarter of $247 million, and that really accounts for the major difference between the as-reported and the adjusted numbers this quarter.\nWhen you look at EPS, we did $4.83. That is $0.71 greater than prior year. That's up 17% from the $4.12 we did last year. So just really solid performance across the board. And again, I can't thank our team enough.\nIf you go to Slide 11, what we did here is we just put a graph together that displays really the elements of that $0.71 or 17% increase in EPS. And again, once again, this quarter, we continue to outperform. It's really driven by volume. Of course, the margin expansion that Tom and I talked about. But really, what I like about this is it really displays our solid operating performance. The majority of the change, all of it is showing up in segment operating income. $0.75 of the $0.71 increase is all segment operating income. If you look at everything else, that's the $0.04 of a drag, but really proud that we were able to not only improve EPS but do it at the operating line.\nIf we jump into Slide 12, this is our segment performance. Growth continues to be broad-based across every segment and every region. Demand is -- continues to be robust. Our orders are up 14%. The team has taken prudent actions to manage the inflationary environment. And that really has positioned us to continue to maintain margin-neutral on all of these price cost issues that are fairly well documented across the world. That and the operating execution that I talked about really allowed us to improve margins in every segment.\nIf you look at our incrementals, 37%, we've talked about this a couple of times, but we still are going up against pandemic-level comps. We had $25 million of discretionary savings in Q3. If you account for that, incrementals would have been 44% for the quarter. So just really solid incremental performance. It really highlights the power of the Win Strategy, and it demonstrates the transformation that we spoke about at our Investor Day just at March 8.\nIf you jump into the segments, North America surpassed sales of $2 billion, organic growth was almost 15% versus prior year, and adjusted operating margins expanded by 100 basis points and reached 22.9% for the quarter. That led the company this quarter, right, which is really impressive. North America has certainly had challenges across the supply chain. It's great to see them rebound and lead the company again.\nTheir incrementals improved in the quarter, and they're the best incrementals they generated all fiscal year. And even more importantly, order rates accelerated to 23% and backlog, of course, grew even stronger. Just very great execution, broad-based demand in the North American segment.\nIf we move to international, sales were about $1.4 billion. Organic growth there is almost 9% from prior year. EMEA and Latin America combined was mid-teens positive, and Asia Pacific was low single digit, but all regions are positive in the international segment. Again, here, operating margins expanded 110 basis points in international and finished really at a high level of 22.7%. Really satisfied to see the consistent performance our international teams continue to post. And we've talked about this. It's been a long-term effort for a long time. And I'm really happy that we're seeing the results out of our international segment. Order rates in international are plus 9%.\nIf we look at aerospace, aerospace continues to rebound. Sales were $632 million. Organic growth was almost 6%. Very strong demand in our commercial markets, both OEM and MRO. And operating margins, great expansion here, 250 basis points of improvement, came in at 21.9%. And I just want to remind everyone, with this great margin performance, we are still operating at below pre-COVID at baseline, when it comes to sales.\nOrders in aerospace are minus 4%. But if you remember, we talked about this last quarter. There were a few large military orders in the prior period that really just kind of make a tough comp in aerospace. If you exclude those items, aerospace orders were positive 20. And again, aerospace dollars in the quarter are the largest dollar level that we've had in the last 4 quarters. So it just really gives us confidence in the aerospace recovery.\nReally proud to be able to share these results across all of our segments. And like Tom says, it really demonstrates the power of the performance and portfolio change that a lot of -- all of our team members have been working on for some time.\nSo if we go to Slide 13, cash flow generation, right? Tom talked about being great generators and great deployers of cash. Year-to-date, we've exceeded $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations. That's 13.3% of sales. Our free cash flow is about $1.4 billion. That's almost 12% of sales. And our year-to-date conversion is 117%. We continue to still manage this diligently in a growth environment, right, which is not the easiest thing to do.\nIf you look at year-to-date, working capital is a use of cash of about 3%. Versus last year, it was a source of cash of about 1.2%. Q4 is our strongest quarter for cash. If you followed us for a long time, you know that. We still continue to forecast mid-teens CFOA. And obviously, greater than 100% conversion when it comes to cash flow conversion.\nTom called out the 29% dividend increase that we announced. This really reflects the confidence we have and our ability to generate cash, not just in the short term but in the long term as we look out to achieving those FY '27 goals.\nJust a few notes on leverage. Our gross debt to EBITDA was 2.8x. Our net debt was 2.6x. But if you remember, we have about $2.5 billion of cash in escrow to pay for the Meggitt transaction. We are classifying that as restricted cash. If you exclude that $2.5 billion, our net debt to EBITDA would be 1.8x.\nNow let's look at the guidance. If I go to Slide 14, on the guidance, we obviously announced an increase to our guidance this morning. I'm going to give it to you on an as-reported and adjusted basis. We're raising full year EPS by $0.10. Last quarter, we were projecting $18.05 per share. We are now at $18.15 per share at the midpoint. We've also narrowed the range to $0.15 on either side.\nSales growth for the full year is forecasted to be about 10%. We did increase the organic guide 50 basis points from 10.5% to 11%, so 11% full year organic growth. And while currency remains a headwind in the quarter, for the full year, we think it will be about a 1% drag to the top line. Just a reminder on currency, for our guide, we are using March 31 rates to calculate our estimate.\nIf you look at the segment operating margins, full year guidance is 22.1%. I just want to call out, if you look at that versus last year's actuals, that's a 100-basis-point increase in segment operating margins. So I'm glad to be able to speak to that. The corporate G&A interest and other is really expected to be $947 million on an as-reported basis and $459 million on an adjusted basis. And the adjusted -- we've kind of -- the adjustments, we've detailed out for everybody. The acquired intangible asset amortization is $315 million. Business, realignment charges are $20 million. LORD cost to achieve is $5 million. And of course, we closed our Russian operations. That is a charge of $20 million. If you're curious, that was $13 million in the segment line and $7 million below the segment operating income line.\nMeggitt acquisition-related expenses that we've incurred to date is $84 million. And finally, that deal contingent hedge that I mentioned, on a full year basis, it's $396 million. We will continue to adjust transaction-related expenses as they are incurred, all the way up until we get to close.\nAnd a note on tax. Our full year tax rate is down a little bit. We expect that to be about 21.5% for the full year. And when you do all the math, for us, that equates to an EPS -- adjusted EPS guide for Q4 of $4.60.\nThis quarter, we actually put another slide in here. It's a bridge on our guidance reconciliation. The Q3 performance that we had, we really outperformed our guide significantly. We beat our guide by $0.29. We've rolled that into our full year guide here. And based on really strong backlog and order rates, in North America specifically, we have increased our Q4 North American organic growth guide by 300 basis points versus what we thought last quarter. And that really is generating about $0.08 of segment operating income in Q4.\nTom has mentioned this, but the COVID-related shutdowns in China are a near-term temporary headwind for us in Q4. Obviously, Q4 is the end of our fiscal year here. We are estimating that to impact Q4 sales by $100 million. We're using a 40% decremental on this $100 million, which is greater than what we normally operate at, simply because a number of our facilities are fully shut down. So we are confident that the facilities that are operating in China and those others in the international segment are going to be able to perform, but we're using a 40% decremental on just that $100 million of near-term headwind. That equates to a $0.24 EPS headwind going into Q4. All the other items net to a slight EPS reduction of $0.03, and that really is the walk on how we get to our new guide of $18.15.\nSo before I turn it back over to Tom, I just want to make sure everyone saw the press release that we issued on Tuesday, with Robin announcing her retirement plans after what will be almost 2 decades with Parker Hannifin. And Robin has really been a driving force within the company, really helping us to transform our M&A processes, our long-range planning and, of course, serving as our voice and our biggest fan with the investment community. She has put forth timeless effort to champion of Pure W, which is our first business resource group that is focusing on developing women leaders, and that will leave a lasting imprint on Parker.\nSo Robin, all of us here, we couldn't be happier for you, for your husband, Scott, as you transition into the best phase, the next phase of your life, and we thank you very much.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nSo I'm going to just pile on while we have Robin blushing and embarrass her even more. She's just done a great job. I've had a chance to work with her for 20 years. If I think about her deal-making skills and what she did when she led M&A, her ability to finance all these transactions, which isn't the easiest thing. And like Todd said, the Investor Relations and you've all experienced it, her ability to be the top spokesperson for the company, just an outstanding leader. We're going to miss her.\nBut thankfully, she's given us lots of lead time here, and she's not leaving until the end of the year. And we'll get every ounce out of her that we possibly can on these next several months. She's nodding her head in agreement.\nSo the last slide, Slide 16. We have a highly engaged team. They're the people behind these results. Their ownership, their engagement that drove the -- is driving our success. You saw the EPS and the margin expansion, just phenomenal, speaks to the Win Strategy, speaks to the portfolio changes. We are a longer-cycle, more resilient company. And we've got great alignment to the secular trends that I referred to earlier. And we're going to help the world as it moves to the clean technologies to be more sustainable.\nWe gave you a new guide -- new feedback where we're headed for FY '27 with continued improvement across the board and really a transformed company with a bright promising future. Again, my thanks to everybody, the global team, just a fantastic quarter, fantastic year-to-date. And I'm going to turn it back to Paul to start the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Parker's Fiscal Year 2022 Q2 Earnings Release. As Jonathan said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. Tom Williams, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President, are both with me here today for the webcast.\nI'd like to direct you to Slide #2, which details our disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's materials. Those materials, those reconciliations, along with this presentation, are accessible under the Investors section at parker.com and will be available for 1 year.\nAs usual, today, Tom is going to begin with highlights of the quarter and a few comments on the company's transformation. I'll follow up with a brief financial summary and review the increase to our full year guidance that we announced this morning. Tom is going to handle closing comments, and then we'll open up the lines for your questions.\nTwo comments before we begin today. First, as a reminder, regarding the pending Meggitt acquisition, we are still bound by the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code in respect to discussing certain transaction details. And secondly, we are announcing a date and time change to our upcoming virtual Investor Day due to a scheduling conflict with another company's Investor Day. Our meeting will now be held on Tuesday, March 8, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern. It will be a virtual event, and among the topics that we'll cover will be the release of our new long-term financial targets.\nSo with that, I'll ask you to move to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to you, Tom.\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and welcome, everybody. Thanks for your participation today. .\nI want to start with the title of this slide, which is exceptional execution in a challenging environment. When you look at the performance of the company in aggregate safety, sales growth, the margin expansion, EPS, it was an extremely strong quarter. This is against arguably one of the most difficult operating environments that we've all faced in our careers when you add up the cumulative effect of inflation, supply chain challenges and the Omicron virus. My thanks to the global team for just a great job execution in this quarter and really the execution for many, many quarters as we go through this presentation.\nLet's start with the first bullet. Focus on safety continues. It is our #1 goal. We're leveraging our high-performance teams, the combination of the natural work teams that we have in our plants and warehouses as well as the Star Point teams and kaizen. And it's really this combination this team structure plus kaizen that is driving an ownership culture within the company. So ownership of safety, but also ownership of quality, cost, delivery and engagement.\nSales growth was 12% year-over-year. Organic growth was 13%. It was nice across all the external reporting segments as well as every region participating. Total sales was the second quarter record as well as total segment operating margin. EBITDA margin was 18.2% as reported or 22.7% adjusted. It was 180 basis points. It's a big move versus prior year. Robust demand environment continues. We had over 90% of our end markets in the growth phase, which we're very excited about.\nAnd this execution, what you're seeing is really the cumulative effect of One Strategy 2.0 and 3.0 driving this kind of performance. When you add the strategy changes on top of the portfolio, things we've done, adding those great acquisitions that we've done over the last number of years, and a powerful secular trends that I'm going to talk about it here momentarily, we see a future as a much longer cycle and more resilient and faster growing.\nSo if you go to the next slide, Slide 4, I've touched on this before. This kind of frames all of our thinking and our strategies for the company to around trying to achieve these 3 key drivers: living up to our purpose that higher calling, that North Star that we're driving for; to be great generators and deployers of cash, to be a top quartile performer versus our proxy peers.\nIf you go to Slide 5, which is the little expression that picture is worth a thousand words. This kind of sums up how the company has changed over the last number of years. We've updated this slide for FY '22 numbers. And I'm going to just reframe the slide for you. On the left-hand side is adjusted EBITDA -- adjusted EPS, and on the right-hand side is adjusted EBITDA margin.\nSo if you look on the left, and you go to FY '16, so we work real hard as a company for 100 years to get to $6.99 EPS. And then the last 6 years, we've grown it by 2.5x to a little over $18 in our current guide. If you just look at the gain that we've had since the pandemic, FY '20 to FY '22 guide, it's almost another $6 just in those 2 years. It happens to be, and I don't think it's coincidental although we launched on One Strategy 3.0 at the beginning of FY '20. And you can see what it's doing to propel performance.\nIf you look on the right-hand side, we don't guide on EBITDA margin, but we put in our EBITDA margin year-to-date to 22.4%. If you look at that from FY '16 to that, it's 770 basis points improvement, just remarkable improvement. Really the how behind these results, it's been our people, portfolio changes that we've done and has been, again, a cumulative effect of One Strategy 2.0, 3.0.\nSo if you go to the next slide, give you a quick update on the Meggitt transaction. We continue to make progress. There's really 4 main work streams that we're working. There's 2 -- the economic and national security review that we're working on with the U.K. government. I would characterize those as constructive and positive and on track. And then the antitrust and FDI filings are proceeding as we had anticipated. We're still anticipating a Q3 calendar 2022 close and we're really excited about this. This is obviously a compelling combination. It doubles the size of our Aerospace business highly complementary technologies. And we're at the beginning of a commercial aerospace recovery with great synergies as we put these 2 companies together. Again, coming -- bringing this on with everything else we've been doing, a much longer cycle, less cyclical, faster-growing companies.\nAnd then on Slide 7, in addition to the strategic acquisitions that we've been making, we are uniquely positioned with our 8 motion control technologies to benefit from the 4 secular trends that you see on this page. Now I touched on Aerospace and the recovery and momentum of Meggitt plus Parker. But if you look at electrification, ESG digitization, what you have here, our long-term multiyear growth enablers and content growth for us is going to grow both on board as well as infrastructure. And we're excited this is going to be a big part of what we'll talk about at Investor Day, and we look forward to sharing more about these secular trends on March 8 with you.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to Todd for more details on the quarter.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tom. I'll ask everyone to move to Slide 9, and I'll start with our FY '22 Q2 results.\nAs Tom mentioned, this was just an outstanding quarter. Just another reminder that our operations leaders are really driving the company to significantly higher levels of performance. Our sales increased 12% versus the prior year. We did hit a record level of $3.8 billion. Tom mentioned this, but organic sales were very healthy at 13%. Currency was about a 1 point drag on sales. That's how we got to the 12% reported sales increase. Demand just remains robust. Our backlogs are healthy. Growth remains very broad-based across all of our industrial businesses.\nIf you look into the Aerospace business, commercial demand continue to trend positive. And we talked about this before, but the acquisitions of CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic continue to outperform our expectations.\nWhen you look at the segment operating margins, it's a Q2 record on an adjusted basis. We did 21.6% segment operating margin, that's 120 basis points improvement from prior year. And our teams are really managing through the well-documented supply chain issues, the inflationary environment. I really just want to commend them on our team's swift actions to manage these costs and inflationary actions, still while achieving record sales in the quarter.\nTom mentioned this, but adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%. That's up 180 basis points from last year. Both our adjusted net income and our adjusted EPS has improved by 29% versus prior year. Net income is $582 million or 15.2% return on sales. And adjusted EPS was $4.46. That's $1.01 increase versus the prior year of $3.45, just a really solid quarter.\nIf we jump to Slide 10. This is just a bridge on adjusted EPS, and I'll just detail some of the components that generated the $1.01 increase in EPS. And as you can see, really, operating execution is the major driver in this increase. Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $132 million. That's 19% greater than prior year. And that really accounts for 80% of the increase in our EPS this quarter.\nWe did have some other favorable items that was $0.19 favorable. There were some currency gains that were favorable. We did sell a few facilities that we restructured those closed in the quarter, and we do have reduced pension expense versus prior year. All of that added up to $0.19. And then you could see the other items on the slide that all netted to $0.04 favorable. But really, the story here is just a very strong operating quarter.\nIf we go to Slide 11, I'll make a few comments on our segment performance. Tom mentioned those secular trends, we are seeing growth from those trends across our segments. Every single one of the segments has a record adjusted segment operating margin this quarter. We did maintain a cost/price neutral position. We're very proud of that. Incrementals were 32% versus prior year. I just want to remind everybody that is against a headwind of $65 million of discretionary savings that we had in the prior year.\nIf you exclude those discretionary savings, our incrementals were 48%. So really fantastic performance across the board from our teams. It really highlights the power of the One Strategy and really demonstrates our ability to perform through this current climate.\nIf you look at orders, orders are plus 12 and really the demand continues to be robust across our businesses.\nJust a little color on Diversified Industrial North America, sales reached $1.8 billion. Organic growth in that segment was 15% versus prior year. And listen, we're really pleased with the performance in this region. We've talked a lot -- I've read -- I know everyone is familiar with the well-documented supply chain issues. Tom mentioned the Omicron spike, we are not immune to that. But we did keep operating margins at a very high level of 21.3% in this segment and we're proud of that. Order rates continued to be very high at plus 17. Our backlog is strong. And Tom mentioned this, 91% of our markets are in growth mode. So great things in the North American businesses.\nIndustrial International is a great story. Sales are $1.4 billion. Organic growth is up 14% in this segment. And I want to note that across all the regions within our International segment, organic growth was mid-teen positive in every region. So really robust activity there. Maybe more impressive is the adjusted operating margins, 22.4%. This is an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year.\nAnd certainly, we have volume. We've talked a lot about our growth in distribution internationally. We are benefiting from some product mix. And really, the team is doing a great job controlling cost. And this has been a really long-term effort over a long period of time from that team. So I'm really happy that they're able to put up these continued high level of margin performance. Order rates there were plus 14%, ample backlog and really solid international performance.\nIf we look at Aerospace Systems, really continued signs of a rebound there. Sale were $618 million. Organic sales are positive at almost 6%. And we did see very strong demand in our commercial OEM and MRO markets. Great margin performance here as well. Operating margins have increased 270 basis points that finished the quarter at 20.7. And again, I just want to remind everyone that, that is still at pre-COVID volume levels. So great margin performance from our Aerospace team.\nAerospace orders on a 12-month rolling rate did decline 7%. But one item I want to make clear for everybody is we did have a few large multiyear military orders in the prior period that really created a tough comp just in Aerospace. If we exclude those orders, Aerospace orders would be plus mid-teens positive. So we're seeing continued signs of steady improvement in Aerospace. Our order dollars in Aerospace in the quarter were at the highest level they've been in the last 3 quarters. So great quarter out of Aerospace.\nBut if you really look at the segments, it's really outstanding operating performance. We've got positive growth, strong order dollars robust backlogs, record margins and really just solid execution across the board. So great segment performance.\nIf I take you to Slide 12 and talk about cash flow on a year-to-date basis, we did exceed $1 billion in cash flow from operations. That is 13.3% of sales. Free cash flow is $900 million or almost 12% of sales and conversion on a year-to-date basis is now 107%. We still continue to diligently manage working capital across the company. We really are just responding to these increased demand levels that we have.\nThe working capital change did improve in the quarter as we forecasted. In the quarter, it was a 1.9% use of cash versus last year, it was a 4.1% source of cash. So for the full year, I just want to reiterate, we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the full year will exceed 100%.\nIf we go to Slide 13 now, I just want to make a few comments on our capital deployment activity. I'm sure many people have seen this, but last week, our Board approved a dividend declaration of $1.03 per share. That is fully supportive of our long-standing 65-year record of increasing dividends paid.\nAnd I want to give an update on the Meggitt financing. We continue to make progress on our financing plan. Our plan is flexible. It is efficient, it is risk-mitigating. I did mention on the last call that we secured a deal contingent forward hedge contract in the amount of GBP 6.4 billion. Accounting rules require us to mark those contracts to market. That impact in the quarter was a noncash charge of $149 million. We booked that in the other expense line, and we are treating that as an adjusted item.\nWe now have USD 2.5 billion of cash deposited in escrow to fund the Meggitt transaction. That is listed on our balance sheet as restricted cash. And that was funded from a combination of commercial paper and some cash on hand. A result of that, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ended up being 2.7x in the quarter. Net debt was 2.5x. If you account for the $2.5 billion of restricted cash, net debt-to-EBITDA would be 1.8.\nOkay. So if we go to Slide 14, I just want to give some details on the increase to guidance that we announced this morning, and of course, we're giving this on an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Full year adjusted EPS is raised by $0.75. We did guide to $17.30 at the midpoint last quarter. We have moved that to $18.05 and that is at the midpoint. We've also narrowed the range. Range is now $0.25, up or down. And sales is also raised. We're raising the midpoint to a range of 10% at the midpoint. We've got a range of 9% to 11%. And the breakdown of that sales change at the midpoint is organic growth is 10.5%. Currency will be about 1 point unfavorable. And of course, there's no impact from acquisitions. As Tom said, we don't expect Meggitt to close in our fiscal year.\nIf we look at the full year adjusted segment operating margin, we're also raising that 20 basis points from the prior guide. Full year now, we expect that to be 22.1% at the midpoint. There is a 20 basis point range on either side of that. And corporate G&A and Other is expected to be 6 56 on an as-reported basis, but 4 35 on an adjusted basis.\nSo of course, there's a couple of adjusted items in there. The acquisition-related intangible assets, that is a standard adjustment, the realignment expenses, standard adjustment, lowered cost to achieve, standard adjustment, but we are adjusting these transaction-related expenses for Meggitt. Year-to-date, we've got $71 million worth of transaction costs, and of course, that $149 million noncash mark-to-market loss that I just mentioned. We're going to continue to adjust for the transaction-related expenses as they are incurred.\nIf you look at tax rate, tax rate is now going to be slightly lower than what we had forecasted just based on first half activity. We expect that to be 22% now. And finally, guidance for the full year assumes sales, adjusted operating income and EPS all split, 48%, first half; 52% in the second half. And just a little bit more color, Q3 -- FY '22 Q3 adjusted EPS guide, we have at $4.54.\nSo with that, Tom, I'll hand it back to you for closing comments, and I'll ask everyone to go to Slide 15\n\nThomas L. Williams\n\nChairman & CEO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd.\nWe've got a highly engaged team around the world living up to our purpose, which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. You've seen what 3.0 has done as I referenced in that EPS that's driving our current performance what's going to drive our future performance. It's early days of One Strategy 3.0, and I would characterize it as having long legs, lots of potential ahead with One strategy 3.0.\nThe portfolio transformation continues. We've acquired 3 great companies, are in the process of a fourth that will make us longer cycle, more resilient. And if you put that on top of the secular trends that I highlighted, we feel very, very positive about the future. So it's been our portfolio changes. It's been the strategy changes, but it really starts with our people, 55,000 team members that are thinking and acting like an owner, so 55,000 owners that are driving this transformation. So my thanks to all of them for what we did in the quarter, but really for what we've done in the last number of years.\nAnd then I'm going to hand it back to Todd for a quick comment just to set up the Q&A before we get started.\n\nTodd M. Leombruno\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Parker-Hannifin Corporation\n\nYes. (Operator Instructions) We do appreciate your cooperation. So Jonathan, I'll turn it over to you for Q&A."

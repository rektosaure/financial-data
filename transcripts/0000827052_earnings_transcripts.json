My name is Denise, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up.\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot, Sam. Good afternoon, everybody. Today, Edison International reported third quarter core earnings per share of $2.34 compared to $1.51 a year ago. This comparison is not meaningful because during the quarter, SCE recorded a true-up for the 2025 General Rate Case final decision which is retroactive to January 1, reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, including the costs for potential early refinancing activities later this year, we are narrowing our 2025 core EPS guidance range to $5.95 to $6.20. We have also refreshed our projections through 2028 and are reaffirming our 5% to 7% core EPS growth target. Maria will discuss our guidance and financial performance in more detail.\nCalifornia's legislative session concluded with the passage of SB 254, a constructive and important step to support IOU customers, address wildfire risk and boost the financial stability of the state's investor-owned utilities. The bill passed with near unanimous support, and that's a clear signal that policymakers understand the urgency of the issue and the need for durable solutions.\nSB 254 creates an up to $18 billion continuation account jointly funded by IOUs and customers to provide a backstop for wildfires ignited after September 19, 2025. Importantly, it enhances the existing framework by basing the liability cap on the year of ignition rather than the year of this allowance, providing certainty for stakeholders. It also allows for the securitization of wildfire claims payments for 2025 wildfires, ignited between January 1 and September 19 if the initial wildfire fund is exhausted, which would apply to the Eaton fire if needed. These provisions are constructive for potential cost recovery and help utilities like FCE continue to invest in safety and reliability while maintaining affordability for customers. We have provided a summary of SB 254 on Page 3.\nSB 254 calls for an important second phase, a comprehensive report due in April 2026 that will evaluate long-term reforms to equitably socialize the risks and costs of climate-driven natural disasters. The law recognizes that customers and shareholders continuing to the burden of these events is unsustainable. This second phase is important to evaluate the broad scope of potential reforms that are necessary for a sustainable model.\nAs you will see on Page 4, the 10 points outlined in SB 254 can be grouped into 3 categories: first, reducing the risk of ignitions and harm from wildfires. Second, affording fair compensation for people affected by wildfires, including avoiding disparate treatment of communities; third, allocating the risk and cost of natural catastrophes across stakeholders equitable. We are encouraged by this direction and by the executive order the Governor Newsom signed on September 30 to expedite the state's all-in response. We look forward to continuing to work with legislators and stakeholders to shape a more sustainable and equitable framework. We are confident that we will see a meaningful legislative action next year.\nTurning to the Eaton Fire. The investigations remain ongoing. As we have said before, SCE is not aware of evidence pointing to another possible source of ignition. Absent additional evidence, SCE believes that it is likely that its equipment could be found to have been associated with the ignition. During the third quarter, SCE entered into a settlement with an insurance claimant agreeing to pay $0.52 for each dollar paid to its policyholders. Note that this is a single data point and does not provide sufficient information to develop an estimate of the total potential losses associated with the Eton fire.\nThe wildfire fund administrator has confirmed that Eaton is a covered wildfire for the purposes of accessing the fund. Based on the information we have reviewed thus far, we remain confident that SCE would make a good faith showing that its conduct with respect to its transmission facilities in the Eaton Canyon area was consistent with actions of our reasonable utility.\nThat said, we continue to take proactive steps to support community members. Shortly, SCE will launch the wildfire recovery compensation program for the Eaton fire. This voluntary program is designed to provide eligible individuals and businesses impacted by the fire, direct payments to result claims quickly. This allows communities to focus on recovery earlier while minimizing the overall cost and outflows from the wildfire fund by reducing escalation, interest expense and legal fees.\nMoving to the regulatory front. The key message is that we've made significant progress across multiple proceedings this year, further derisking our financial outlook and bolstering our ability to deliver for customers and investors.\nEarlier this year, the CPUC approved the TKM settlement, authorizing recovery of approximately $1.6 billion in wildfire-related costs. More recently, SCE reached a settlement agreement with intervenors in the Woolsey Fire proceeding as highlighted on Page 5. This marks a significant milestone and puts the company 1 step closer towards fully resolving the 2017 and 2018 agency events. The agreement with authorized recovery of approximately $2 billion of the $5.6 billion requested subject to CPUC approval.\nThis structure supports long-term affordability for customers by reducing excess financing costs and improving credit metrics, specifically up to a 90 basis point benefit to FFO-to-debt and an annualized interest expense benefit of approximately $0.18 per share. Combined with the TKM settlement, this will result in recovery of 43% or about $3.6 billion of the total cost above insurance and FERC recoveries. We anticipate a final decision from the CPUC toward the end of this year or early next year. And assuming CPUC approval we expect to receive proceeds from securitization mid-2026. Details of both proceedings can be found on Page 6.\nSCE also received a final decision on its 2025 general rate case in September, as highlighted on Page 7. The decision authorizes 2025 base revenue of $9.7 billion, and support significant investments in wildfire mitigation, safety and reliability and upgrades for increased load growth, while incorporating affordability considerations for customers. It also authorizes average revenue increases of about $500 million per year for 2026 to 2028 subject to adjustment based on inflation.\nOn capital expenditures, the final decision authorizes 91% of SCE's request. Importantly, the commissioners highlighted that these investments in the grid provide long-lasting value to customers. especially given the need to protect against wildfires, advanced electrification and ensure a ready, reliable grid for the clean energy future.\nOn wildfire mitigation, SCE has now deployed more than 6,800 miles of covered conductor. I'm pleased to share that by the end of the year, SCE will have had nearly 90% or more than 14,000 miles of its total distribution lines in high fire risk areas. The GRC authorizes installing another 1,650 miles of covered conductor for wildfire mitigation, as well as 212 miles of targeted undergrounding. Similar to covered conductor, which continues to be an important risk mitigation tool SCE believes that its targeted undergrounding program will also provide substantial benefits to further safeguard its customers and communities.\nPublic Safety Power Shutoffs remain a critical tool in wildfire prevention. This year's updates include revise criteria and wound speed thresholds, expanded circuit coverage and broader boundaries around high fire risk areas. Additionally, SCE has now enabled fast-curve settings on approximately 93% of its 1,100 distribution circuits in high fire risk areas, further reducing the cognition risk and improving system safety.\nAs we've shared before, SCE's system average rate continues to be the lowest among the major IOUs in the state. Importantly, the utility expects this will grow at an inflation-like level on average through 2028. Incorporating the GRC approval, TKM settlement and pending Wise settlement, we continue to expect that CAGR to be in the range of 2% to 3%.\nIn closing, I want to thank our team members for their continued dedication and resilience. And I also want to thank our investors for your support and our customers for the opportunity to serve them. This has been a year of meaningful progress on the legislative front, in the regulatory arena and in our operational execution. We've taken important steps to resolve legacy wildfire liabilities, strengthen our financial position, and advance the utilities mission to safely deliver reliable, affordable and clean energy. But we also recognize that this has been a challenging time for so many of the communities we serve particularly those impacted by wildfires.\nWe remain deeply committed to learning from our experiences in supporting recovery and resilience to rebuild stronger. We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with customers, local leaders and other stakeholders to build a safer and more sustainable energy future. Well, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with many of you at the EEI Financial Conference in November. We'll see you there.\nAnd with that, Maria, let me turn it over to you for your financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks, Pedro. I will echo your comments that we have made significant progress across multiple proceedings this year, further derisking our financial outlook and bolstering our ability to deliver for customers and investors. With a GRC final decision in hand, we now have increased certainty and visibility into the work SCE will do to meet customers' needs and have refreshed our projections through 2028. Consequently, we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% core EPS growth target which I will discuss in detail.\nStarting with third quarter 2025 results, EIX delivered core EPS of $2.34, up from $1.51 a year ago. The year-over-year variance analysis is on Page 8. As Pedro noted, this comparison is not meaningful because SCE recorded a true-up of approximately $0.55 for the 2025 GRC final decision, which is retroactive to January 1.\nBased on strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are narrowing our 2025 core EPS guidance to $5.95 to $6.20, as you will see on Page 9. This range now includes the potential for $10 per share cost associated with refinancing tied to the TKM and Willy cost recoveries. As previously mentioned, our 2025 guidance does not include the potential earnings associated with the Woolsey settlement. SCE is awaiting a proposed decision on the settlement and a final decision could be issued later this year or early next. We want to be clear that for measuring our core EPS growth through 2028, the 2025 baseline of $5.84 is unchanged from prior disclosure.\nNow I would like to discuss our refreshed projections, which we have summarized on Page 10. Additionally, on Pages 14 through 17, we put together a comprehensive list of frequently asked questions on guidance-related topics for background and easy reference, which we hope you will find helpful.\nPlease turn to Page 11, which lays out our 4-year capital plan of $28 billion to $29 billion. This compares to our previous forecast for the same period of $27 billion to $32 billion. The plan incorporates substantial investments in infrastructure replacement, electrification and system resiliency approved in SCE's GRC Additionally, the plan now incorporates the utilities next-gen ERP project and other updates across the business, including wildfire mitigation capital that SCE will securitize under SB 254.\nWe also continue to see the need for substantial grid investments beyond our forecast period. We've highlighted on the right side of the page, 2 examples of this with much of that spending occurring beyond 2028. Driven by the capital plan, we project rate base growth of 7% to 8% as shown on Page 12. This growth is after incorporating the expected wildfire mitigation capital expenditures that will not earn an equity return under SB 254.\nMoving on to our long-term core EPS growth target, as shown on Page 13. We continue to expect 2028 core EPS of $6.74 to $7.14. You will find additional information on this topic on Pages 14 and 15. Our confidence in delivering on our commitments is underpinned by the clarity we have from the GRC and our ability to manage our operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.\nLet me now turn to our financing strategy and balance sheet strength. Over the last several years, we have executed efficient financing to support our target 15% to 17% FFO-to-debt framework. We have used hybrid securities to generate equity content when needed, avoiding substantial common equity issuance to prefund our capital plans. By year-end, SCE expects to receive approximately $1.6 billion in securitization proceeds from the TKM settlement. Following Woolsey settlement approval, the utility plans to request the financing order to securitize an additional $2 billion. These actions further strengthen our credit metrics and financing flexibility for funding future rate base and dividend growth.\nAltogether, this leaves us very well placed among our peers on 2 key credit metrics. EIX has one of the strongest consolidated FFO to debt ratios projected by S&P. Also, we have one of the lowest levels of parent company debt as a percentage of total debt. Page 13 details our 2025 through 2028 financing plan. Let me highlight that this plan does not require any equity issuance. This expectation is supported by the TKM and Woolsey recoveries.\nFurther, as you know, the wildfire fund provides reimbursement for claims paid above an IOU's $1 billion of insurance. Additionally, for fires between January 1 and September 19, 2025, the recently passed SB 254 allows the utility to issue securitized bonds prior to a reasonableness review to fund claims payments should the initial fund be exhausted. While we currently cannot estimate the probable losses associated with the Eaton Fire, the constructive California liquidity and prudency framework means neither equity or debt would need to be issued in connection with that event.\nFollowing the passage of SB 254, the rating agencies issued updates on the company. Moody's affirmed its ratings for both EIX and SCE with a stable outlook. Fitch removed its Rating Watch Negative from both companies, citing SB 254 as a meaningful policy shift. While S&P downgraded EIX and SCE by one notch, we believe this view does not fully recognize the legislative intent or commentary from the Governor's office. Importantly, S&P still expect our credit metrics to remain within our target with upside potential from a constructive Woolsey outcome.\nAt the parent company, we are working on how to best address the preferred equity issuances that have upcoming rate resets. We are looking at cost-efficient options for early refinancing, which will bring forward both the costs and the benefits of the transaction. The core benefit is the titan clarity of financing costs before the rate reset, which further derisks our financial outlook. We have considered the potential cost of this optimization in our narrow 2025 core EPS guidance and see the long-term benefits outweighing the near-term costs.\nI would like to update you on another positive trend we are seeing, load growth. As we have laid out on Page 18, a SCE remains well positioned to meet the diverse and accelerating demand across its service area. Our team continues to anticipate significant investments in infrastructure upgrades to meet this growing demand. many of which were included in SCE's recent GRC approval. Importantly, our demand forecast is not reliant on a single sector.\nFor one, SCE is at the heart of California's EV adoption, helping the state maintain its national leadership in transportation electrification. In fact, the state recently announced a record 29% of new cars purchased in Q3 2025 were 0 emission vehicles. We're also expecting growth in new housing developments and increases in commercial and industrial consumption. To sum up, we are expecting a near-term load growth CAGR of up to 3%. In the long term, we project electricity sales will nearly double over the next 2 decades.\nI will conclude by saying that the company has made significant progress achieving certainty across numerous regulatory proceedings this year. allowing us to confidently reaffirm our long-term guidance. It underscores our ability to execute on our commitments and deliver for the customers and communities SCE serves and for our investors. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nDenise, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. So everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions."

During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up.\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nThanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will address 3 key topics for our investors, an update on the Eaton fire. Our confidence that California's legislature will support healthy investor-owned utilities and an update on regulatory decisions and future actions that position SCE well to deliver on its commitments for customers and other stakeholders.\nLet me start with a brief comment on earnings. Today, Edison International reported second quarter core earnings per share of $0.97 compared to $1.23 a year ago. However, as I have mentioned before, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a final decision in its 2025 general rate case. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our ability to meet our 2025 EPS guidance and deliver a 5% to 7% core EPS CAGR through 2028. I will touch on the GRC proposed decision in a few minutes and Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks.\nOn the Eaton Fire, the investigations by SCE and the LA County Fire Department remain ongoing. There are no additional disclosures on the ignition or estimated cost at this point. To recap, SCE is not aware of evidence pointing to another possible source of emission. Absent additional evidence, we believe that SCE equipment could have been associated with the admission. In addition, numerous lawsuits have already been brought against SCE. If it is determined that SCE's transmission equipment was associated with the addition of the Eaton fire. Based on the information we have reviewed thus far, we remain confident that SCE would make a good faith showing at its contract with respect to its transmission facilities in the Eaton Canyon area was consistent with actions of a reasonable utilities.\nAs we know from prior wildfire events engaging with and helping the community is critical. That's why we announced last week the wildfire recovery compensation program, which SCE will launch this fall. The program will provide direct payments to eligible individuals and businesses. resolving claims quickly allows the community to focus on recovery and minimizes the overall cost by mitigating the impacts of interest expense and inflation. This will also help use the wildfire fund efficiently and have more of the cash support impacted community members instead of being spent on higher legal costs.\nOn the legislative front, we are encouraged by the continuing discussions with the Governor's office and legislators to enhance California's industry-leading AB 1054 regulatory framework. Given the economy-wide consequences of in action, we believe policymakers will strengthen California's wildfire framework during the current legislative session. The issue of wildfires is not just a utility regulation issue. The full solution must include broader actions across multiple sectors and could be addressed during next year's legislative session.\nSeparately, a number of affordability bills are being discussed. Our track record on cost management, which I will discuss in a few minutes, shows our commitment to affordability. There are good steps the legislature can consider to improve affordability, like rightsizing public purpose programs and NEM, and streamlining siding and permanent. However, provisions like securitizing capital may be well intentioned, but in fact, would actually raise customer costs by deteriorating credit quality. We will continue to engage with legislators to help them make decisions that are grounded in the facts.\nMoving to the regulatory front. SCE continues to build on its progress across multiple proceedings, further derisking our financial outlook. Maria will expand on several of those proceedings in her remarks, but let me touch on the proposed decision in SCE's 2025 DRC issued by the administrative law judge on Monday. Page 3 provides a summit. The PD overall generally aligns with our range case rate base forecast. We share the ALJ's view that critical investments are needed to maintain a safe, reliable and increasingly clean electric grid.\nOn the other hand, key areas of the PD require improvement, so SCE will seek revisions. The PD would authorize base revenue of $9.8 billion or 93% of SCE's requested revenue requirement. It also supports significant capital investments in wildfire mitigation, grid modernization and infrastructure replacement, while incorporating affordability considerations for customers. The reductions from SCE's request primarily relate to scope, pacing or cost, not to the underlying need or effectiveness of the programs.\nMost notably, the PD finds that covered conductor has been a highly effective wildfire mitigation strategy and that no party recommended a reduction to SCE's request. It also notes that no party disputed that targeted undergrounding is an effective tool for SCE, although it would authorize fewer miles than SCE proposed. The PD affirms the reasonableness of the utilities base load growth forecast and recognizes the importance of SCE's planning methodology, which integrates statewide forecasts with local system knowledge. This supports our long-term strategy to ensure the grid is ready for California's electrified future. However, there are some areas where the PD is not fully aligned with customer needs and will be part of the utility's opening comments. Maria will say more in her remarks.\nThe January wildfires underscore the importance of mitigation plans and the need for continuous and evolving tools to maintain infrastructure resiliency. SCE submitted its 2026 through 2028 wildfire mitigation plan in May, outlining a comprehensive strategy to address both immediate and long-term wildfire risks with new and innovative solutions. The plan reflects the utility's commitment to public safety, risk reduction and affordability and builds on foundational mitigations such as covered conductor targeted undergrounding and enhanced vegetation management.\nOver the 2026 to 2028 period, SCE anticipates investing $6.2 billion. The plan also supports continued use of aerial firefighting assets, including the world's largest heli-tankers with nighttime capabilities and aims to inspect approximately 1 million trees annually. Public safety power shutoffs remain a critical tool in wildfire prevention. This year's PSPS updates include revised criteria and wind speed thresholds, expanded circuit coverage and broader boundaries around high fire risk areas. As always, SCE remains focused on customer support and outreach to enhance safety and reduce the impact of PSPS events. Additional details can be found on Page 4.\nAs you will recall, a year ago, we shared our projection that even with 100% of SCE's GRC request, the utility expects its system average rate to grow on average at an inflation-like level through 2028. Based on where things stand today, that is still the expectation, which is further enabled by SCE's enduring focus on operational excellence and efficiently managing costs for customers. SCE has a more than 15-year track record with the lowest system average rate among California's major industrial-owned utilities, banks to successfully executing on its operational excellence initiatives and taking proactive measures to address customer affordability.\nTechnology is a major driver of better affordability, safety, reliability and resiliency. For example, last month, EEI once again selected EIX and SCE as the winner of their prestigious Edison Award, recognizing distinguished leadership, innovation and contribution to the advancement of the electric industry for the benefit of all. Our winning project, SCE's Advanced Waveform Anomaly Recognition Engine are AWARE for short, uses real-time grid sensor data, AI and machine learning to proactively predict potential system issues and pinpoint where failures take place with an SCE service territory. Customers benefit from higher safety and reliability, faster restoration times and higher affordability through optimized crew time. I am proud of our team for their steadfast commitment to operational excellence and for creating this AI-driven solution to help make the grid safer and more resilient for our communities.\nI will conclude my remarks by reiterating the key messages. First, SCE is continuing with its investigation on the origin and cost of the Eaton fire, and there are no new disclosures about the ignition or cost estimate at this time. When we have additional relevant information, we will share it with you and importantly, we'll continue our transparency with our community. Second, we are confident that legislative action will ultimately enhance California's AB 1054 regulatory framework. Third, SCE is well positioned from a regulatory standpoint to deliver for customers and investors.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Maria for her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon. In my comments today, I will cover second quarter 2025 results, provide additional insight into key regulatory proceedings and update you on other financial topics. Starting with the second quarter, EIX reported core EPS of $0.97 compared to $1.23 last year.\nPage 5 provides the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis. As Pedro mentioned, the year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a final decision in its 2025 GRC. SCE continues to book revenues at 2024 authorized levels adjusted for the change in ROE and we'll record a true-up when it receives a final decision. SCE's core EPS variance was primarily driven by higher O&M expense and the net impact of regulatory decisions received in each period. EIX parent and other variance was primarily driven by higher interest expense.\nI'd like to expand on Pedro's comments on the wildfire recovery compensation program for the Eaton Fire. As SCE resolved claims, we would not expect to see actual or estimated costs run through the income statement, aside from the small shareholder contribution associated with self insurance. The cost would be offset by SCE's customer-funded self-insurance for the first $1 billion and then by receivables or regulatory assets associated with the wildfire fund and regulation put in place by AB 1054. An efficient reimbursement process from the Wildfire Fund also means SCE would not have to issue long-term debt to fund payments.\nOn SCE's 2025 general rate case, if adopted, the PD would result in base rate revenue requirements of $9.8 billion in 2025, $10.2 billion in 2026, $10.6 billion in 2027 and $11 billion in 2028. translating the rate base numbers shown in the proposed decision into total company rate base and holding all else constant, the results would be generally in line with our current range case. Following a final decision, we will incorporate all aspects of the GRC into our long-term plans and refresh our projections.\nIn SCE's opening comments, it will outline areas where it believes revisions are warranted to deliver better outcomes for customers and ensure the decision aligns with the evidentiary record, applicable law and established regulatory principles. Let me expand on a couple of areas.\nOn wildfire mitigation, the decision would authorize more than 1,800 miles of grid hardening, consistent with SCE's total hardening request. However, it shifts about 400 miles from targeted undergrounding to the covered conductor program. While the PD reflects a significant increase to the historical level of targeted undergrounding, it falls short of SCE's well-supported request. This reduction limits SCE's ability to appropriately mitigate the wildfire risk in the most vulnerable areas.\nOn infrastructure replacement, the PD would approve the majority of the proposed programs but scales back the scope. The decision recognizes the importance of resuming infrastructure replacement after several years of wildfire focused spending but we believe the gradual ramp-up does not fully reflect the urgency of today's reliability and electrification needs.\nAs for the next steps, oral argument is scheduled for August 11, and SCE will file its opening comments on August 18 and reply comments are due August 25. The earliest the commission can vote on the proposed decision is at its August 28 voting meeting. During oral argument and in comments, SCE will advocate for adjustments that better align with the state's climate objectives and the safety and resiliency needs of the communities we serve. As we've said before, we understand the commission's desire to balance safety, reliability and affordability, and we will continue to work collaboratively to ensure the utilities programs deliver value to customers.\nContinuing on to the regulatory front, SCE has advanced other regulatory proceedings and outcomes, ultimately, derisking our financial outlook. I will highlight a few updates.\nFirst, the CPUC issued final decisions in SCE's WMCE and WM VM proceedings, providing certainty on the timing of cost recovery and contribution to our 2025 earnings guidance. On the WMCE settlement agreement, the CPUC authorized recovery of more than $300 million of O&M and $700 million of capital for historical wildfire mitigation and restoration. In SCE's 2022 WM/VM proceeding, the CPUC authorized the recovery of about $290 million of O&M and $99 million of capital while disallowing about $65 million of O&M. I'll note that SCE has filed an application for rehearing to address certain legal and factual errors that resulted in incorrect disallowances of costs incurred to make SCE system and communities safer and more resilient to wildfire threats.\nSecond, as another step toward recovering historical costs, in April, SCE filed its application for authority to issue securitized bonds to finance the recovery of about $1.6 billion related to the TKM proceeding. This securitization allows for the issuance of recovery bonds with the highest possible credit rating, which reduces financing costs for SCE's customers. The ALJ recently issued a proposed decision, which would approve the financing order, and the schedule calls for the final decision in August.\nThird, on the Woolsey cost recovery application, SCE recently filed its rebuttal testimony. The schedule includes a motion for consideration of a settlement agreement or joint statement of stipulations of issues due on August 12. As always, as SCE is open to settlement discussions if a fair and reasonable outcome can be achieved, benefiting customers and shareholders.\nLastly, the 2026 cost of capital proceeding continues to progress with interveners submitting their testimony yesterday evening. During the quarter, the ALJ also issued a scoping memo with a schedule that calls for a proposed decision in November.\nTurning to Pages 6 and 7. SCE's capital expenditure and rate base forecasts remain unchanged while we await a final GRC decision. The utility continues to make investments in safety, reliability and resiliency. The rate case request supports investments that are essential to meet customer needs both today and through the end of 2028. This includes critical work in infrastructure replacement and wildfire mitigation, as well as investments to meet the growing demand in our service area. As we have highlighted before, we continue to see substantial additional capital needs beyond the GRC that are incremental to the plan.\nMoving on to our EPS guidance outlined on Pages 8 and 9, we are confident in reaffirming the 2025 range of $5.94 to $6.34 and our long-term EPS growth expectations of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2028. As a reminder, we will refresh our financial guidance 6 weeks after SCE receives a final decision in its 2025 GRC. This will include our capital and rate base projections, 2025 core EPS range, long-term core EPS growth and financing plans.\nThat concludes my remarks, and back to you, Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nDenise, can you please open the call for questions? As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up, so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions. ."

My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] . Today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read this carefully.\nThe presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. [Operator Instructions].\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nWell, thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Just 3 months have passed and see devastating wildfires and all of us at Edison continue to keep everyone affected in our thoughts. We are working closely with state and county leaders and the communities of Altadena and Malibu to rebuild wildfire impacted areas stronger than ever. I will share further updates in a minute after touching on our earnings headlines.\nToday, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.37 compared to $1.13 a year ago. However, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2025 General Rate Case. SCE recognized revenues from CPUC activities for both the first quarter 2024 and 2025 and largely based on 2024 authorized base revenue requirements with 2025 adjusted for the lower authorized CPUC ROE.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to meet our 2025 EPS guidance and deliver a 5% to 7% core EPS CAGR to 2028. Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks. We recently provided Governor Newsom with SCE's initial comprehensive plans to rebuild the impacted electrical distribution infrastructure in the Palisade and Eaton fire areas.\nUnder this plan, SCE would underground more than 150 circuit miles, including nearly all distribution power lines in high fire risk areas within the burn cars of the affected communities. Once constructed, this grid hardening will increase reliability and make electrical distribution infrastructure more resilient to high wind and other extreme weather events, helping us better protect and serve our communities.\nOn the Eaton fire. SCE's investigation continues. Since our last update, the utility completed additional physical and video inspections of the electrical equipment in Eaton Canyon which were carried out in collaboration with stakeholders. Analysis of the images, videos and equipment is ongoing. The utility also recently began the removal of portions of the idle facilities in Eaton Canyon for further expert review. While SCE has not conclusively determined that its equipment was associated with the admission of the Eaton fire. It is also not aware of evidence conclusively pointing to another source of edition.\nAbsent additional evidence SCE believes that its equipment could have been associated with the addition of the Eaton fire. As such, and in light of pending litigation, it is probable that EIX and SCE will incur material losses in connection with the Eaton Fire. As always, we are committed to being transparent throughout this process. With significant media coverage surrounding the Eaton fire, we have noted numerous instances where facts have been misrepresented.\nWe address factual errors and misstatements. We launched a new page on our website called Edison for the record. I encourage you to take a look and a link can be found on Page 3. I will reiterate that we continue to believe that SCE is a reasonable operator of its electric system, if it is determined that SCE's transmission equipment was associated with the addition of the Eaton fire, based on the information we have reviewed thus far, we remain confident that SCE would make a good faith showing that its conduct with respect to its transmission facilities in the Eaton Canyon area was consistent with actions of a reasonable utility.\nTurning to the legislative front. We have continued to engage in broad discussions with legislators and the governor's office to support the safety of our communities and enhance California's industry-leading AB 1054 regulatory framework. The conversations we've had leave us with no doubt that stakeholders understand the criticality of addressing the issue and the important role the investor-owned utilities play in supporting California's growth and economic development.\nWe are confident policymakers are focused on the need to strengthen and restore confidence in California's wildfire framework. On the regulatory front, I'm pleased to share that SCE continues to reach important milestones this year. The CPUC's unanimous approval of the TKM settlement agreement signals a constructive California regulatory environment.\nLast month, the [ Wolfe ] cost recovery ALJ issued the scoping memo, adopting the scheduled SCE and intervenors jointly proposed. The next major filings will be inter-meter testimony in early June and rebuttal testimony in mid-July. The schedule also includes their motion for consideration of a settlement agreement or joint statement of stipulations of issues due in mid-August. As we have noted in the past, SCE is open to settlement discussions if a fair and reasonable outcome can be achieved benefiting customers and shareholders.\nWe will keep you updated as the utility continues its progress towards resolution in this proceeding. Maria will highlight other milestones in her remarks.\nOn SCE's 2025 General Rate Case, the ALJ recently made an administrative ruling extending the statutory deadline, which is typical and expected based on the prior calendar. Nonetheless, we continue to be optimistic that we will see a proposed decision in the first half of the year with the final decision as soon as 30 days later. The GRC will support SCE's commitment to providing electric service that is reliable, resilient and ready for customers' needs. The utility's significant investment plan is driven by the need to resume a traditional level of infrastructure replacement work necessary for system reliability and continue its wildfire mitigation programs that protect the safety of customers and the public.\nSCE's full GRC request also includes about $1.4 billion of annual capital spending on wildfire mitigation and includes hardening an additional 1,800 miles of the utilities overhead distribution infrastructure. SCE will submit its 2026 wildfire mitigation plan in May. This comprehensive WMP reflects our collective priorities, risk mitigation, public safety and affordability.\nIt also includes continued deployment of covered conductor and targeted undergrounding. Utility looks forward to executing its integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, which prioritizes industry-leading practices such as grid hardening, asset inspections and vegetation management.\nBefore I turn it over to Maria, I would like to take a moment to say a big, big thank to a few very special members of our team. Last week, Vanessa Chang retired from our Board of direction directors. And we congratulate Vanessa on her retirement and are so thankful for her 18 years of dedicated service and leadership on the board.\nI also want to recognize our former General Counsel, Adam Umanoff, who we previously announced, we'll be retiring in July. Adam has simply been the ideal General Counsel. He is a business leader above all, who is also a constant at legal esprit. On top of that, Adam has been a step to spread to many in our organization. And absolutely, he spent that to me.\nOn behalf of our Board and management team, we want to thank Adam for his outstanding service. At the same time, I am delighted to welcome Chonda Nwamu, who joined us earlier this month as our new General Counsel. Chonda brings substantial expertise within our sector and a solid understanding of California's legal, political and regulatory environments. We're excited to have Chonda here and look forward to her leadership and partnership.\nAll right. Maria, with that, I'll turn it over to you for the financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and I echo the appreciation for Adam and Vanessa and welcome Chonda. Now my comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results provide additional insight into key regulatory proceedings and update you on other financial topics. Starting with the first quarter, EIX reported core EPS of $1.37.\nThe Page 4 provides the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis. As Pedro mentioned, the year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received the final decision in its 2025 general rate case. SCE is booking revenues at 2024 authorized levels adjusted for the change in ROE and will report a true-up when it receives the final decision. First quarter EPS includes about $0.30 associated with the TKM settlement approval, partially offset by higher interest expense at EIX Parent and Other.\nOn the regulatory front, I want to echo Pedro's comment on SCE making significant progress across numerous proceedings. Let me highlight a few. First, SCE recently reached a settlement agreement with interveners and its WMCE proceeding related to wildfire mitigation and restoration. The settlement, which is awaiting CPUC approval, would authorize 100% of the capital expenditures, along with 96% of the O&M. It would also contribute about $0.10 per share of true-up earnings and about $700 million of rate base, both of which are embedded in our 2025 guidance.\nSecond, on SCE's 2026 cost of capital application summarized on Page 5. SCE requested an ROE of 11.75% and and proposed updating the embedded cost of debt and preferred equity. The request also recommends the continuation of the cost of capital mechanism and to reset the benchmark. The utility made a strong case for its ROE based on risks that differentiate California utilities from their peers and other jurisdictions. SCE's proposed schedule called for a PD in November which would allow for a final decision by year-end. Historically, the CPUC has issued timely decisions on cost of capital applications.\nThird, SCE filed its next-gen ERP application with the CPUC seeking total capital investment of about $1.1 billion. The utility expects this program will provide substantial benefits to customers and enable business improvements. As a reminder, this program is not currently embedded in our capital and rate base projections.\nLastly, with the $1.6 billion TKM cost recovery settlement now approved, within the next few weeks, SCE will file an application requesting authorization to issue securitized bonds. Moving to SCE's GRC. The utilities request provides the foundation for advancing critical customer objectives. Reliability, resiliency and readiness as well as supporting our growth outlook through 2028. As you can see on Page 6, we will refresh our guidance following a GRC final decision. We wanted to be proactive in sharing with you that 6 weeks after a final decision, we will provide our updated capital and rate base projections, 2025 core EPS range, long-term core EPS growth and financing plans.\nTurning to SCE's capital expenditure and rate base forecasts shown on Pages 7 and 8. The utility continues to execute against a capital plan that targets key programs while maintaining flexibility in later years, to adapt to what is ultimately authorized in the GRC. As I highlighted in comments going into 2025, we continue to see substantial additional capital opportunities that are incremental to the plan. This includes investments to enhance our distribution system and more than $2 billion of FERC transmission spending.\nIn addition, SCE plans to file an application for its advanced metering infrastructure program. to request funding to replace its smart meter fleet, the majority of which were installed more than a decade ago. This program will address technology obsolescence and offers a chance to incorporate future capabilities that benefit customers. The program is expected to provide insights into energy usage and enable smarter energy management, thereby enhancing grid efficiency.\nTurning to the financing activities. I will highlight 2 recent transactions. In March, EIX issued $550 million of senior notes, which successfully addresses our parent debt needs for 2025. Additionally, SCE issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt as part of its planned financings for the year. Both of these offerings saw strong investor support and were significantly oversubscribed.\nMoving to EPS guidance on Pages 9 and 10. We are confident in affirming the 2025 range of $5.94 to $6.34 and reaffirming our long-term EPS growth expectations of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2028, which translates to $6.74 to $7.14 of 2028 EPS.\nLet me conclude by reinforcing our confidence in delivering on our financial targets. With a strong regulatory backdrop and robust rate base growth, coupled with a significant need for incremental grid investments, we are well positioned to deliver on the company's near- and long-term growth expectations.\nThat concludes my remarks, and back to you, Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nMichelle? Please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]."

Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries.

During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up.\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nThanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that our hearts continue to be with everyone who has been impacted by the recent Southern California wildfires, including our own 18 team members who lost their homes. We are so grateful for the first responders, our colleagues, partners who have begun the long recovery process. Edison's #1 value and priority remains safety and that means to give the public safety of our customers and the safety of our team members. SCE continues to make tremendous progress as it works diligently on restructuring after the Eaton and Palisades fires.\nTurning to the Eaton fire. Its cost remains undetermined and the investigation is complex. SCE is examining the available evidence to help determine potential specification, including the possibility of being linked to SCEs equipment. Engineers, photogrammetrists, meteorologists and other experts are reviewing images, videos and other information of this review. We anticipate the full investigation will take several months or longer to complete, and there isn't a discrete time line for the county or SCE to complete their respective investigations.\nFor example, one valuable next step involves further examination and testing of the idle transmission line near the reported point of origin, semen the equipment for things like Arc marks or missing metal, but this may take many weeks as it requires agreeing on a protocol with plants attorneys interest of stakeholders. We are committed to being transparent throughout this process.\nWhile this investigation is ongoing, we believe that SCE is a reasonable operator of its electric system. In the commission has recognized a notion that the prudent standard does not demand perfection. We believe the prudence derives from the ones of the utilities decision-making process. And whether it's overall policies and systems and practices are consistent with action of a reasonable utility. And there is CPUC precedent supporting our interpretation. If it is determined that SCE's transmission equipment was associated with the addition of the Eaton fire, based on the information we have reviewed, thus far, we are content that SCE would make a good faith showing that is conduct with respect to its transmit facilities in the Eaton can area was consistent with actions of a reasonable utility. That is the standard by which the utility is judged as written into statute by AB 1054.\nPage 3 provides a number of helpful links that pertain to information on SCE's wildfire mitigation, company disclosures, legislation and other resources. The catastrophic impact the reason wildfires underscores the importance of grid resiliency and the actions SCE has taken harden its system to support the communities it serves. SCE continues to execute its robust risk-prioritized wildfire mitigation plan, which is approved by California's Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety and ratified by the CPUC. This has significantly bolstered efforts to protect against wildfire threats and to respond when they happen. SCE has now installed more than 6,400 miles of covered conductor, and has hardened nearly 90% of its distribution lines in high fire risk carrier.\nThis is in addition to significant investments in operational measures in transmission and distribution, such as vegetation management and the extensive network of weather stations and high-definition AI-enabled wildfire cameras to provide greater situational awareness for SCE and fire agencies. We will continue to invest in SCE's important work to make its system safer for its customers and communities.\nOn the regulatory framework, SCE has received timely approval of its safety certification each year, which provides a presumption of prudency and a cap on the liability to reimburse the wildfire fund. We have confidence in the fund, and we believe it is working as intended to protect wild fire victims customers and investors. The fund has $21 billion of creating capacity and has largely been unused by California IOUs. Let me also emphasize that the fund provides liquidity for paying claims. Thus, in the event the utility were to make claims payments, it would not have to use its balance sheet.\nTurning to the legislative front. California has constantly demonstrated a strong commitment to supporting customers and the investor-owned utilities that serve them. Over my own 25-year career at Edison, I have personally witnessed a state's leadership during challenging times from the energy crisis in the early 2000s to the urgent need to develop new generation resources in the mid-2000s, managing through the financial crisis in 2008, dealing with natural gas spikes in the mid-2010s, and guiding the state to the COVID pandemic.\nImportantly, Governor Newsom led the charge in 2019, along with his colleagues in the legislature to pass and implement AB 1054 and that is the model among all states to address wildfire risk. If we conclude SCE's equipment Ignited Eaton Fire, which was then fanned by hurricane force winds in spite of Firefighters best efforts, the catastrophe is precisely what AB 1054 was designed to address, recognizing wildfire risk will never be 0. This legislation reshaped the regulatory and financial landscape by balancing wildfire cost recovery with utility accountability and customer protections.\nMultiple stakeholders benefit, and I want to focus on 3 broad areas. First, customer and community safety benefit from the risk reduction achieved through the WMP and safety certification process; second, communities that suffer losses related to wildfires associated with utility equipment have a funding source for claims payments; and third, investor-owned utilities that participate in the fund benefit from a structure that provides liquidity for claims payments, a clear prudent standard and a liability cap, all of which took financial stability and long-term investment in the grid at the most affordable cost to customers.\nThe magnitude and wildfires has brought the long-term durability of the fund into focus. We have been actively engaged in conversations with key stakeholders, including other utilities, the Governor's office and legislative leaders to find solutions to support the safety of the community, effectively manage customer costs and reinforce investor confidence in California utilities. We are confident policymakers will make the enhancements needed to strengthen the industry-leading AB 1054 regulatory framework.\nBefore moving on to our financial results, I'd like to note in addition to our Board of Directors that was announced last week. Former U.S. Secretary of Energy, Jennifer will join the Board of Directors of both EIX and SCE. Jennifer has deep expertise in energy technology, energy policy, safety and sustainability. We are thrilled that she is joining our Board, and we look forward to that she will provide based on her understanding of the technical and political and economic forces shaping our industry today. I know Jennifer has many organizations seeking her time, so I appreciate her vote of confidence in our company's strong future.\nFor 2024, Edison International's core EPS of $4.93 was above the midpoint of our guidance. This extends our track record of meeting or exceeding annual EPS guidance over the last 2 decades. Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to meet our 2025 EPS guidance and deliver a 5% to 7% core EPS CAGR through 2028. Maria will discuss our financial performance and outlook later. Further, today, the Board declared EIX's First Quarter 2025 common stock dividend of $0.8275 per share. Consistent with this regular process the board took into account a broad range of considerations and scenarios before making this declaration. There is no change to our current dividend policy or outlook and this balances a competitive dividend that investors expect with reinvesting SCE's earnings back into the infrastructure that serves customers' needs.\nThis consistent and growing dividend demonstrates the confidence in our financial outlook, which supports raising cost-effective capital and directly benefits customer rates. On the regulatory front, we are very encouraged by the CPUC's unanimous approval of the TKM settlement agreement, allowing SCE to recover about $1.6 billion or 60% of the wildfire claims payments and associated costs to pre-AB 1054 wildfire. Approval of the settlement signals a constructive cost recovery framework in California. In fact, following approval, CPUC President Reynolds made important remarks about cost recovery and AB 1054. She noted how under state law, SCE like public entities is liable for damages from a fire caused by its electrical system. But if the utility acted prudently, these costs are covered by customers. She also noted that because of AB 1054, in the future, the wildfire fund would cover claims similar to those in TKM. SCE expects to file its TKM securitization application in March.\nThe Woolsey cost recovery proceeding is underway. Based on the prehearing conference, participating interveners noted focus engagement to those in -- If the ALJ adopts the schedule SCE and interveners jointly proposed, the next major filings to watch for are intervener testimony due in early June and rebuttal testimony due in mid-July. The proposed schedule also includes a motion for approval of a settlement agreement or joint statement of stipulations of issues that will be due in mid-August.\nJust like with TKM, the utility is open to settlement discussions if a fair and reasonable outcome can be achieved. And we look forward to keeping you updated on progress and this important proceeding.\nOkay. I want to conclude by saying that SCE is focused on partnering with immunities on near- and long-term strategies to build back stronger, all while we continue to execute on core operations, and deliver on the commitments we have for the year. I look forward to sharing more updates throughout the year.\nWith that, Maria, turn it over to you for your financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro. Before I turn to our financial results, I also want to take a moment to recognize the tireless efforts of our team to manage the response to the Southern California fires. Our management team is grateful for our colleagues who have come together to restore and help customers recover.\nSo now turning to my comments for today. I will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, outlook areas for 2025, SCE's capital and rate base forecasts and 2025 guidance. For the fourth quarter, EIX reported core EPS of $1.05. Full year 2024 core EPS of $4.93 was above the midpoint of our guidance range. Pages 6 and 7 provide the year-over-year variance analysis and additional color can be found in earnings news release. This strong performance demonstrates our ability to manage the business and ends our track record of meeting annual EPS guidance over the last 2 decades, as shown on Page 8. Delivering strong financial results was just one accomplishment and another year of strong execution in 2024, as shown on Page 9.\nSCE also gained its progress in hardening the grid and making its system safer for customers by installing over 800 miles of covered conductor, bringing total deployment to more than 6,400 miles. On the regulatory front, we used to see a number of positive developments. First, the timely settlement of TKM, which Pedro addressed earlier. Second, utility reached substantial completion of resolving claims for Woolsey and filed the cost recovery application. Third, the CPUC issued a final decision in the 2022 SEMA proceeding, which contributed $0.14 to 2024 EPS. Fourth, the utility continued its strong advocacy in the 2025 GRC and settled numerous issues with interveners. Lastly, reflecting the confidence and commitment to achieving our long-term EPS growth target, in December, we raised the dividend by 6.1%, which is the 21st consecutive annual increase.\nPage 10 summarize the key management focus areas for 2025. We supporting the people and communities affected by wildfires is front and center. Rebuilding and emerging stronger by restoring structure and bringing power back to those areas is critical. SCE will also continue its wildfire mitigation work and its focus on operational excellence to reduce cost to customer. There will also be additional progress on the regulatory front. This year, we expect SCE will receive decisions on a 2025 general rate case, it's WMC -- and its cost of capital application for 2026 through 2028.\nAdditionally, the utility will be filing an application for its next-gen ERP program. SCE will also continue its progress towards resolving the Woolsey cost recovery proceeding.\nLet's now turn to SCE's capital and rate base forecast, pages 11, 12 and 13. The 2025 GRC is the core driver of the outlook through 2028. The SCE's capital plan based on replacing aging infrastructure to support reliability and safety for customers, continuing grid hardening investments to mitigate and enhance our resiliency, and expanding the grid to make the system ready for low growth today and in the future as customers increase their electricity usage.\nI would also like to highlight several additional capital deployment opportunities that support customer needs over the coming years, which we have discussed in the past and are not yet included in the plan. SCE has refined emits for these projects resulting in an increase of at least $1 billion to these opportunities. One such investment is the next-gen ERP project I just mentioned. Later this year, the utility also plans to file an application, advanced metering infrastructure program to replace and upgrade the first generation of smart meters at the end of their useful lives.\nWe also anticipate additional system needs on the distribution grid, including for system restoration and expansion. Further, SCE has more than $2 billion of FERC transmission projects in development.\nMoving to SCE's 2025 GRC, the utility is awaiting position from the ALJ. We remain optimistic that we could see a proposed decision during the first half of the year. To reiterate our previous comments, SCE made a compelling case. And based on the position, SCE's rate base growth would still be in line with its range case forecast of 6%. Once SCE gets a final decision from the CPUC on the GRC, we will refresh our capital plan, financing plan, 2025 EPS guidance and EPS forecast.\nTurning to EPS guidance. Page 14 shows our 2025 core EPS guidance and modeling considerations. You will see that we have revised the guidance range. This is simply our prior range of $5.50 to $5.90, plus the incremental $0.44 associated with the recently approved TKM settlement. As we have discussed before, those $0.44 are composed of a $0.30 onetime true historical interest expense and the $0.14 annual reduction in unrecoverable risk expense. While SCE waits for the GRC decision, I want to remind you that we will be recording revenue at 2024 rates adjusted for the change in ROE. Therefore, quarterly results comparisons pending a 2025 GRC decision are not meaningful. We will record a true-up when we receive a final decision.\nSCE has established a memo account to track the differences in revenue until it receives the final decision, which will be retroactive to January 1.\nI'll touch briefly on the parent financing plan. This year, EIX has $100 million debt maturities, a portion of which were prefunded through a debt offering last December.\nMoving to our longer-term outlook on Page 15, you will see that we have also incorporated a benefit from the $0.14 interest expense reduction resulting from the TKM settlement into the 2028 EPS range. Given that this annual interest reduction will be ongoing and as part of our base year, we are maintaining our target of 5% to 7% core EPS growth off a higher base of $5.84. While the cause of the Eaton fire remains under investigation, and we are not speculating on potential outcomes, AB 1054 was enacted to ensure the financial stability of California's utilities and scenarios like this. The supportive regulatory framework and processes established by this legislation ensure that no utility would have to use its balance sheet while accessing the wildfire fund to make claims payments. Additionally, the potential liability to reimburse the fund is capped. Lastly, the prudency standard means the utility is presumed to be a prudent manager if it has a safety certification, which SCE has. Given these factors and the supportive regulatory framework, we remain confident in our financial outlook as we continue to support wildfire response, recovery and efforts to rebuild. SCE's core operations and the central role of plate in the clean energy transition remain the driving force behind our core earnings growth.\nThat concludes my remarks. Back to you, Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nMichelle, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions. ."

With this strong start to the first half of the year, we are confident in reaffirming our 2024 core EPS guidance of $4.75 to $5.05.\nBased on the progress in SCE's 2025 general rate case, including many partial settlements, we are also confident in getting a strong outcome for customers. The funding authorized in the GRC to continue making investments in a reliable, resilient and ready grid is the linchman for achieving our 2025 EPS guidance and delivering a 5% to 7% EPS CAGR to 2028.\nMy remarks today include four important insights. First, low growth trends are materializing sooner than expected, reinforcing SCE's substantial CapEx opportunities with potential upside. Second, SCE is now forecasting system average rate increases through 2028 to be closely aligned with inflation rates, ensuring more stable costs for customers. Third, the company's overall operational and financial risk profiles have significantly improved and are only getting better. Fourth, Edison International is leading the charge towards a carbon-neutral California, with sustainability at the core of our strategy.\nLeading up with load growth trends. I highlighted last quarter that we are seeing 2% to 3% annual sales growth in the coming years with an inflection point above 3% annual growth beginning in 2028. However, these demand trends are materializing sooner than expected. As you can see on Page 3, our 10-year load growth forecast has increased substantially in just a relatively short time since SCE's 2022 distribution system plan was prepared. We now expect 35% higher 10-year load growth, far exceeding all prior internal and external forecasts.\nOne significant driver is more customers calling SCE to request load growth projects, including commercial developments, particularly logistics-related buildings, transportation electrification and new residential housing. In parallel, forecasted policy-driven electric vehicle and building electrification demand has increased. We expect new policies will drive higher customer adoption in the near future, and we have incorporated this information so the grid is ready when customers reach out to us.\nWe see two major implications from growth showing up sooner and at a larger scale than anticipated. Over a 10-year system planning horizon, [ grid ] upgrades will need to be implemented several years ahead of schedule to accommodate the increased load. As SCE highlighted in its GRC request, serving customers with a reliable, resilient and ready grid will require the utility to significantly expand the electric system through substantial investments that will drive continued rate base growth.\nAs our investment levels grow to support economy-wide electrification, affordability remains top of mind. We have demonstrated cost leadership over the years, resulting in the lowest system average rate among the major California investor-owned utilities. You will notice that SCE's current system average rate of $0.267 per kilowatt hour is actually lower than at the start of the year. On June 1, SCE reduced rates by about 2% and driven by removing historical costs that have been fully recovered in rates. SCE recently filed an application with the CPUC for approval of its 2025 fuel and purchase power costs, which are projected to be lower than in 2024. Based on current projections, this application would reduce the system average rate by another 9%. This offsets most of the increase in rates that will follow the 2025 GRC final decision.\nOn Page 4, we now project SCE's rate increases through 2028 to be closely aligned with local inflation levels. To put this in context, let me emphasize two important underlying assumptions. This 2.6% projected rate growth incorporates both the requested increases in SCE's GRC and full recovery of SCE's legigacy wildfire costs. As you will recall, SCE has recovered a significant amount of historical costs tracked in regulatory accounts over the last few years. These historical costs rolling out of rates, combined with rising electricity consumption, partially offset the increases I just mentioned. You have all witnessed how the company's overall operational and financial risk profiles have significantly improved in recent years.\nOn Page 5, we reemphasized the estimated wildfire risk reduction of 85% to 88% compared to pre-2018. As you know, we've been reporting on the $1 billion annual and $3.5 billion over 3 years losses because those tied to AB 1054. They are the threshold for accessing the wildfire insurance fund and SCE's liability cap when we began reporting this metric.\nWe are now also showing you the loss level that would result from hitting the liability cap in a single year which is about $4 billion. The risk reduction of this scenario is over 90%. The differentiator for SCE's wildfire risk mitigation and operational risk profile is the substantial physical grid hardening it has completed. A key benefit of physical grid hardening is that it reduces the burden on customers arising from heavy reliance on operational measures like power shutoffs or fast rip settings. In just 5.5 years, SCE has deployed approximately 5,900 miles of covered conductor.\nAs you see on Page 6, combined with miles underground, SCE has 84% of its planned hardening complete, and that's permanent physical and observable risk mitigation. It is getting even better. By the end of 2025, SCE expects to be approaching 90% of total distribution lines in high fire risk area being hardened.\nAs you can see on Page 7, SCE is leading the way in physical risk reduction with its total hardened miles and high fire risk area exceeding those of all other California IOUs combined. In addition to all the successful wildfire mitigation work by SCE, and also by peer utilities, the State of California itself has the strongest wildfire risk reduction profile in the nation.\nAs outlined on Page 8, that is due to notable improvements via legislation, regulation and suppression. California's legislature passed the landmark Assembly Bill 1054 in 2019, which codifies the prudency standard for IOUs, created the $21 billion wildfire insurance fund and establish a utility liability cap. These are now models informing other states as the threat of wildfires have spread nationwide.\nOn regulation, the CPUC and other agencies have implemented processes for rigorously reviewing and approving wildfire mitigation plans and safety certifications. On suppression, California has consistently shown its commitment to resource allocation. CAL FIRE's budget has doubled since 2017 to '18, along with an 80% increase in staffing. CAL FIRE has the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world and recently contracted for 20 additional helicopters and 4 airplanes.\nSCE is also contributing to local fire agency suppression capabilities through the funding of the year-round quick reaction force. This is made up of the world's largest fire suppression helicopters with unique night firefighting capabilities. This partnership with the L.A. County Fire Department, Orange County Fire Authority and Ventura County [ Fio ] department helps suppress fires regardless of how they start, and it helps protect the communities SCE serves. This is the sixth straight year the utility has funded aerial suppression resources as part of its wildfire mitigation efforts.\nTurning to sustainability. We continue to lead the way towards a clean energy future. SCE is a leader in California's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also focusing on the grid investments needed for a more resilient equitable clean energy economy. I am proud of all that we've done to execute on our long-term net 0 commitment in alignment with California's ambitious policy goals. I encourage you to read our 2023 sustainability report for details about our accomplishments, our goals and our long-term ESG commitments.\nPages 9 and 10 highlight a few of our accomplishments. In 2023, SCE delivered 52% carbon-free power to customers and that's 55% cleaner than the national average. SCE contracted approximately 2,200 megawatts of energy storage, bringing the total at year-end to about 7,200 megawatts and that's currently standing at 8,100 megawatts. This is simply one of the largest portfolios in the nation.\nLastly, the utility met or outperformed nearly all wildfire mitigation targets last year and invested heavily in hardening the grid leading to the 85% to more than 90% risk reduction I discussed earlier.\nLet me conclude by saying that Edison International is leading the charge towards a carbon-neutral California. We're committed to ensuring that the clean energy transition remains reliable, resilient, affordable, equitable and accessible to all customers and communities.\nWith that, Maria will provide her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon. In my comments today, I would like to emphasize four key financial messages.\nFirst, we are pleased with EIX's financial performance for the first half of the year. Combined with the outlook for the second half, Edison is on track to deliver yet another year of solid results for 2024.\nSecond, SCE's regulatory outcomes this year have been positive and based on the continuing progress on the two key ongoing CPUC proceedings the 2025 GRC and TKM cost recovery, we are confident in getting good outcomes for customers.\nThird, with SCE having the lowest system average rate among California IOUs, it is best positioned to address load growth and resulting capital needs as customers dependency on and use of electricity growth.\nFourth, EIX's equity needs to fund our substantial capital program over the next several years are among the lowest in the industry.\nLet's begin with a brief review of our second quarter results. EIX reported core EPS of $1.23. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 11, core earnings grew by $0.22. This EPS growth was primarily due to higher CPUC revenue authorized in track 4 of the 2021 GRC, higher authorized rate of return and the final decision on SCE's CEMA application. Partially offsetting these drivers was higher interest expense associated with debt for wildfire claims payments, EIX Parent and Other was in line with the same period last year.\nOn the regulatory front, we are pleased with the outcomes this year. For instance, as I just mentioned, the CPUC recently issued a favorable decision on SCE's CEMA application. Additionally, SCE received approval in July for interim rate recovery in its 2022 WM VM proceeding, enabling the collection of $210 million of the $384 million request in customer rates beginning in October. Also in July, the CPUC approved the Energy division resolution regarding the implementation of the cost of capital mechanism for 2024.\nWhen we look at where bond yields are today, it's clear that the interest rate environment that triggers the mechanism was sustained. Thus, the 10.75% ROE should stay in place also for 2025. These regulatory decisions, of course, the numerous others we have received over the last few years have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and credit metrics. Since 2021, SCE has recovered more than $4 billion with another approximately $2 billion expected through 2025, all of which you can see on Page 12.\nI would like to now comment on the two key ongoing regulatory proceedings starting with SCE's 2025 GRC. Page 13 provides an update on the proceeding, which remains on track.\nDuring the second quarter, SCE filed its update testimony and all parties recently filed their opening brief. We are pleased with the tremendous work SCE has done to narrow the focus of the proceeding. SCE has reached partial settlements covering 12 areas of the GRC, representing nearly 20% of the O&M request and about 8% of the capital request.\nOn the TKM cost recovery application, [ Cal Advocates ] was the only party to submit prepared testimony. They criticize the maturity of SCE's prefire mitigation measures, leading up to the unprecedented 2017 fire season, but did not put forward a specific disallowance proposal. SCE served strong rebuttal testimony on July 11, identifying [ Keith ] laws and [ Cal Advocate's ] testimony and highlighting the interveners heavy and incorrect reliance on hindsight in its review of the record.\nAs for next steps, the ALJ extended the schedule such that the motion for settlement approval or case management statement is due on August 7, and hearings will be in November or January.\nIn summary, based on the evidence put forward so far in this proceeding, we reaffirm the strength of our cost recovery request. We look forward to keeping you informed on further developments on this front.\nPlease turn to Page 14 for an update on the resolution of SCE's legacy wildfires. Having made substantial progress, SCE has now resolved 98% of TKM individual plaintiff claims and 92% of will be individual plaintiff claims. SCE will file its [ loyalty ] cost recovery application in the third quarter.\nSCE's capital and rate base forecasts shown on Pages 15 and 16 are consistent with last quarter's disclosures. SCE's 2025 GRC underpins our forecast as the utility continues to make investments necessary to meet the critical objectives of reliability, resiliency and readiness to meet customers' needs today and in the future. In addition to our forecast, SCE continues to target filing stand-alone applications over the next couple of years that will give it opportunities to deploy capital above and beyond the rate case outcome. The next-gen ERP system application is tracking for late this year with the Advanced Metering 2.0 application expected in 2025.\nI would also like to mention that in May, [ CISO ] selected SCE in partnership with [ LOTUS ] Infrastructure as the winning bidder for the North [indiscernible] transmission project. At expected completion in 2032, this project will add about $245 million to SCE's FERC rate base. This builds on the more than $2 billion of transmission spending that was directly awarded to SCE as the incumbent utility in CISO's 2022, 2023 transmission plan.\nTurning to EPS guidance. Page 17 shows our 2024 core EPS guidance and modeling considerations. We are pleased with our start to the year, and with SEMA approved and no other CPUC decisions built into our 2024 guidance, we are confident in achieving the range of $4.75 to $5.05. Also, I'm pleased to share that we've completed EIX financing plan with the issuance of $500 million of debt at the end of June and having achieved our planned $100 million of equity via internal programs earlier in the year.\nI would now like to reemphasize that for the 2025 through 2028 period, we have equity needs of only $400 million in total, even though we plan to deploy substantial amounts of capital. As you can see on the right side of Page 18, SCE's strong cash flow generation and the incremental debt to finance accretive growth address nearly all of our cash needs. We credit this to our strong financial discipline, efficient financing execution and the significant memo account recovery I just mentioned.\nLet me conclude by saying that California's clean energy future depends on substantial investment in the grid as the economy depends even more on electricity. Affordability and equity will be key components to driving greater adoption of transportation and building electrification. With SCE having the lowest system average rate among California IOUs it is very well positioned to make substantial capital investments as customers' dependency on and use of electricity grows.\nThat concludes my remarks, and I'll pass it back to Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nJulie, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask a question."

My name is Missy, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Missy, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nWell, thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Edison International's core EPS for first quarter 2024 was $1.13. We are pleased with our start to the year, and we are confident in affirming our 2024 core EPS guidance of $4.70 to $5.05. We also remain confident in delivering on our long-term EPS growth targets of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025 and similarly for 2025 to 2028. Our conviction remains grounded in the drivers that continue to support our outlook.\nStarting with SCE's legacy wildfires. The utility continues to advance the process of resolving claims. Based on the latest information available, which Maria will expand on, the best estimate of losses increased by $490 million or $333 million after tax. With wildfires now a national issue, litigation outcomes outside of California are impacting the cost to resolve claims everywhere. We remain committed to achieving ultimate certainty by working through the process expeditiously and seeking cost recovery. We are confident about the case SCE has made in TKM and will make for [indiscernible]. I would like to reiterate that we strongly believe that cost recovery is warranted and in the public interest, and we conservatively have not reflected the significant potential in our financial projections.\nOn the operations front, I want to start by highlighting Edison's leadership of the industry's response to climate change. Recent wildfires across the nation have provided a stark reminder of the changing climate conditions, which underscore the need for further enhancing resiliency and adaptation as we transition to a clean energy future. SCE is a clear leader in wildfire mitigation and is sharing its expertise with peers across the industry, who are now experiencing similar conditions. We have shown that wildfire risk associated with utility infrastructure is manageable. Also, our state has dramatically increased resources for fire suppression including having the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. Our regulators understand the importance of financially healthy utilities. AB 1054 put in place constructive prudency standards and the insurance fund. Over the past five years, SCE has invested about $5 billion of wildfire mitigation-related capital and expects to invest more than $6 billion over the next five years. This investment ranks among the highest levels in the utility sector.\nOn Page 3, you can see the numbers and the results. I will point out that SCE has not seen ignitions due to the failure of covered conductor, and the program is well recognized for its effectiveness. Putting this all together into what it means for reducing future risk of losses from wildfires. We estimate the risk is 85% to 88% lower than pre-2018.\nTurning to Page 5. Let me highlight three key points that enhance the significance of this reduction. First, physical mitigation dominates. Unlike heavy reliance on operational measures like power shutoffs or faster settings, the primary driver behind this risk reduction is physical mitigation. This is important because it means a much lower burden for customers. Second, SCE's estimate comes from Moody's RMS industry-leading model, widely trusted by insurers. This model considers intricate factors, terrain, vegetation, historical data and more to predict wildfire probabilities. Third, to estimate the probabilities of losses in dollar terms, we employ a stochastic model. This model runs 50,000 simulations, considering potential emissions and fire sizes while incorporating SCE's mitigation strategy. This approach contrasts with simpler deterministic methods used by some other companies and regulators that only analyze past events. In summary, our rigorous data-driven approach validated externally paints a clear picture. SCE's risk profile today is dramatically different than in the past as a result of the utilities mitigation efforts.\nTo focus specifically on grid hardening, Pages 6 and 7 highlight SCE's significant progress to date. I'm pleased with the progress our team has made, and I look forward to continued progress making our communities even safer. By the end of 2025, SCE expects to be approaching 90% physical hardening of its distribution lines and high fire risk areas. With over 7,300 miles already underground and more than 5,700 overhead miles hardened, SCE's total hardened miles surpassed those of all other California IOUs combined. We're really proud of these efforts to swiftly enhance grid safety for SCE's customers.\nTurning to load growth. After years of relatively flat demand, we are seeing 2% to 3% annual growth in the coming years with an inflection point above 3% annual growth beginning in 2028. In SCE service area, we project this growth will be driven by the continued adoption of electric vehicles, increases in industrial electrification and higher penetration of building electrification. In California, 1/4 of new cars sold in 2023 were zero emission vehicles, and that trend is continuing into 2024. As another indication of this acceleration, the state recently reached a milestone of over 100,000 public EV chargers now installed throughout California, and that is on top of over 500,000 at home chargers. Southern California already has a significant data center presence. So while we also see low growth potential from this sector, we expect transportation, electrification to drive a more substantial increase in the region's electricity demand.\nAs our investment levels grow to support economy-wide electrification, affordability remains top of mind. We have demonstrated cost leadership over the years, resulting in the lowest system average rate among the major California IOUs. This discipline of managing our cost is a continuous focus. For example, we previously highlighted that the 2025 GRC application included $41 million of annual O&M savings as an immediate benefit for customers. Well, building on that [ in SCE's ] rebuttal testimony submitted earlier this month, the utility identified another $35 million of annual O&M savings to further mitigate the revenue increase.\n2024 is very much a year of execution across the business, and we are pleased with our start to the year. SCE continues to make significant investments and make the grid safer year after year. We continue to see constructive regulatory decisions. SCE is also making progress toward full resolution of the legacy wildfires. All of this allows us to remain confident in our ability to achieve our near and long-term commitments.\nI will conclude by reemphasizing that Edison International offers an excellent investment vehicle to participate in California's clean energy transition. SCE is hardening the grid every day to the benefit of customers and investors, and its wildfire mitigation execution has shown positive results for five wildfire seasons running. California is at the forefront of electrification, decarbonization and climate adaptation. As an electric-only, wires-focused utility, SCE is in a strong position to focus on the future which will be electric led. Our commitment to clean energy leadership and innovation is well recognized in the industry and has only been further elevated as the impacts of climate change become more prominent. Ensuring the greatest reliable, resilient and ready is paramount to achieving the clean energy transition and the driving theme of our investments and growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Maria for her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will cover first quarter 2024 results, provide an update on regulatory proceedings and discuss 2024 EPS guidance. I also want to reaffirm our continued confidence in achieving our EPS growth targets.\nLet me begin with first quarter results. EIX reported core EPS of $1.13. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 8, core earnings grew by $0.04, primarily due to higher CPUC revenue authorized in [ track 4 ] of the 2021 GRC and higher authorized rates of returns, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with debt for wildfire claims payments. EIX [ Parents and Other ] was in line with the same period last year.\nTurning to SCE's capital and rate base forecast shown on Pages 9 and 10. These are consistent with last quarter's disclosures. The bulk of the capital plan will be addressed by SCE's 2025 GRC. The rate case includes investments necessary to meet the critical objectives of reliability, resiliency and readiness to meet customers' needs today and in the future. This includes gearing up traditional distribution grid investments on activities such as infrastructure replacement and load growth as well as continued wildfire mitigation. SCE is facing the fastest electricity demand growth in decades. Thus, the capital plan reflects resuming traditional levels of infrastructure replacements necessary for system reliability and making significant investments to support load growth, driven in large part by transportation electrification.\nDuring the first quarter, interveners submitted their testimony and recommendations in the GRC proceeding. The key points are summarized on Page 11. In summary, we are not surprised by [ Cal Advocates ] and [ turns ] focus areas, and we are confident that we will secure a good outcome for customers. Altogether, the recommendations would translate to rate base growth of approximately 6%, which is consistent with our projected 6% to 8% rate base growth range.\nFurther on the regulatory front, SCE is advancing a handful of other key proceedings, including the 2022 CEMA, the TKM cost recovery application and the recently filed WMCE application. Earlier this month, SCE received a favorable proposed decision in the 2022 [indiscernible] proceeding. If adopted, it would authorize $191 million of revenue that would be recovered over 12 months and fully approved $312 million of capital expenditures. The PD is scheduled to be voted on at the CPUC's May 30 meeting. It's a big positive to get this decision earlier in the year and its approval strengthens our 2024 EPS guidance.\nAdditionally, the ALJ and the cost of capital proceeding recently issued a proposed decision that would deny intervenors petition for modification that sought to suspend the cost of capital mechanism. This decision is consistent with the intent articulated by the CPUC when the cost of capital mechanism was originally adopted and reinforces our views on the topic and the constructive California regulatory environment.\nPage 12 provides an update on the resolution of SCE's legacy wildfires, which continues to advance. The change in the estimated losses was primarily driven by information obtained related to the Woolsey Fire mediation program. Recall that plaintiffs who had opted into the program were required to submit their demand by a deadline in February. The demands received revealed that more plaintiffs intend to continue to pursue claims as considerably fewer plaintiffs have dropped their litigation in Woolsey and observed in the TKM process.\nSettlement outcomes during the quarter also exceeded previously estimated values. SCE has now resolved 97% of TKM individual [ plainted ] claims and 86% of Woolsey individual plaintiff claims and is on track to file the Woolsey cost recovery application in Q3. I will remind you that SCE intends to seek full recovery of all eligible costs, so the increase will be reflected in the cost recovery applications. In the TKM proceeding, next steps include intervener testimony due May 29 and SCE's rebuttal testimony to June 28.\nTurning to EPS guidance. Page 13 shows our 2024 core EPS guidance and modeling considerations. We are pleased with our start to the year and are confident in affirming the range of $4.75 to $5.05. As Pedro mentioned, the estimated losses for the 2017 and 2018 events increased. As a reminder, SCE funds the cost to resolve claims with debt, which is excluded from its regulatory capital structure. Thus, SCE expects to issue additional debt, which will result in about $0.02 of incremental interest expense in 2024. Regardless, we maintain our confidence in achieving our EPS guidance. SCE's cost recovery applications include the financing costs associated with resolving claims. So this increase will also be reflected in the cost recovery application.\nOn the financing front, I want to underscore that we have limited equity needs as we continue to deploy substantial amounts of capital and extend our dividend track record. As shown on Page 14, the parent's 2024 financing plan is nearly complete and we have already addressed our equity needs via internal programs. Also, we maintain our forecast of about $100 million of equity per year through 2028. As you can see on the right side of Page 15, SCE's strong cash flow generation and the incremental debt to finance accretive growth address nearly all our cash needs through 2028. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet through efficient financing execution along with regulatory asset recovery of about $4 billion over the last three years and approximately $2 billion expected through 2025. This ability to track and recover prior spending is yet another constructive feature of our regulation, which balances the ability to execute critical work with strong regulatory oversight.\nIn recognition of our balance sheet strength, we were pleased that last week, S&P affirmed our credit ratings and stable outlook. Importantly, they lowered our FFO to debt downgrade threshold to 14% from 15%, noting the key driver of this action is the company's decreasing business risk. We're proud to see S&P's recognition of our leadership role in mitigating wildfire risk, especially in an environment where climate risk and credit thresholds across the industry are increasing.\nLastly, I'll remind you that we've provided modeling sensitivities to help you quantify what cost recovery for the 2017 and 2018 events means for a few key metrics. Each $1 billion of recovery would improve our FFO to debt ratio by about 40 to 50 basis points and reduced interest expense by $35 million per year. These benefits don't only accrue to our owners. We believe customers will benefit by potentially avoiding as much as $4.9 billion of excess financing costs, a clear win for overall affordability.\nLet me conclude by saying that our confidence in meeting our financial targets remain strong. Underpinning this conference in the near term and long term is our focus on execution. Execution to deliver on our earnings targets, execution to advance regulatory proceedings and execution of our cost management initiatives, the cornerstone for SCE's cost leadership and lowest system average rate among major IOUs in California.\nThat concludes my remarks, and back to you, Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nMissy, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. So everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions."

Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nWell, thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us.\nI am pleased to report that Edison International's core EPS for 2023 was $4.76, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range despite the pending CEMA decision shifting into 2024. This strong performance demonstrates our ability to manage the business and extends our track record of meeting annual EPS guidance over the last 2 decades, as shown on Page 3. Today, we are introducing 2024 EPS guidance of $4.75 to $5.05. This range incorporates a planned investment in O&M for reliability-focused activities and redeploy savings from prior years into operational excellence initiatives. The spending will benefit customers and therefore, shareholders in the long run. I also reaffirm our strong confidence we have in our long-term EPS growth targets of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025 and also 2025 to 2028. Maria will discuss our financial performance and outlook later on the call.\nPage 4 shows our accomplishments in 2023. First, we, once again, delivered on our annual EPS guidance. Second, SCE exceeded its wildfire mitigation plan target to install 1,100 circuit miles of covered conductor, bringing the total to more than 580 in just 5 years. We are proud of this progress, which combined with enhanced medication management, asset inspections and other programs has significantly reduced the need for public safety power shutoffs.\nIncorporating this progress into the independent wildfire risk model managed by Moody's RMS, you can see on Page 5 that SCE has achieved 85% to 88% risk reduction as compared to pre-2018 levels. Third, SCE filed its cost recovery application for the TKM events requesting $2.4 billion. SCE provided a compelling case that it prudently designed, managed and operated its equipment and that the associated costs were reasonably incurred. Lastly, we raised our annual dividend by 5.8%, reflecting the board and management's continued confidence and commitment to delivering on our EPS growth targets.\nOur dividend yield is in excess of 4% and remains a key component of our total return proposition. This marked the 20th consecutive annual increase in Edison International's dividend.\nPage 6 provides an update on the 2017 and 2018 wildfire resolution and our approach for 2024. I would like to emphasize 3 takeaways. First, SCE continues to make solid progress, and overall claims are settling in line with expectations. SCE revised the best estimate of total losses upward by $65 million with the majority of this based on a single settlement. The deadline in the Woolsey settlement protocol to provide complete claims packages was yesterday and SCE is now evaluating the responses. Second, the utility targets resolving more than 90% of Woolsey claims and filing the cost recovery application in Q3. Third, CPUC President, Reynolds, issued the scoping memo earlier this month for the TKM proceeding, which largely adopts SCE framing of the issues. We are encouraged for this ruling because the issues will be handled in a single phase, allowing for a final decision as soon as Q1 of 2025. Also the schedule provides an opportunity for parties to submit a settlement agreement. I would like to remind you that our financial assumptions for 2025 and beyond do not factor in the cost recovery applications, which would represent substantial value for the company and SCE's customers.\nPage 7 summarizes the key management focus areas for 2024. On the wildfire mitigation front, SCE plans to install an additional 1,050 miles of covered conductor in 2024, after which this program will start to ramp down. By the end of next year, SCE will be approaching a significant milestone, 90 hardening of its total distribution lines and its high fire risk area. You can see this depicted on Page 8. Also SCE will continue its GRC advocacy for funding critical investments that will enable efficient electrification and the state screen energy transition.\nI want to emphasize that distribution grid investment accounts for more than 85% of SCE's capital plan, and these investments are crucial for ensuring reliability, resiliency and readiness. The CPUC has consistently approved this type of spending in previous GRCs, reinforcing our confidence in SCE's request. As for the legal and financial categories, I just discussed our legal approach, including filing the Woolsey application in the third quarter, and Maria will discuss our financial targets shortly.\nWe, at Edison, are equally focused on the long term. As we have highlighted in several industry-leading white papers, the grid will be a key enabler for realizing California's pathway to NetZero. To get there, it will be critical to rapidly expand the high-voltage transmission system and the localized distribution networks that serve customers. This aligns well with the underlying drivers of our investment outlook. As more and more vehicles and buildings are electrified, the electricity demand will increase by 80% over the next 20 years, which will benefit customer affordability through a 40% decrease in their total energy costs across electricity, gasoline and natural gas. After years of flat demand, SCE is projecting an uptick in electricity usage of about 2% annually over the coming years. To accelerate the development of new markets over time, SCE has developed innovative proposals, including its nation-leading suite of transportation electrification programs. Recently, although the CPUC denied SCE's building electrification application due to their near-term affordability pressures, it acknowledge SCE's leadership and proposing programs to accelerate much-needed building decarbonization. The utility will continue to evaluate the results of other building electrification pilots it has in progress, and we'll also look for different ways to support the state in advancing its green energy priorities. Another area where we continue to innovate is building our digital and AI capabilities to drive greater efficiency. We are investing in technologies to improve our data analytics skills to enhance decision-making and strengthen operational excellence. For example, we are using generative AI to improve inspections, customer experience and grid planning. Today, our team is also using AI for research, workflow automations and code development. In SCE's customer service operations, AI is enabling call center agents to retrieve information faster, performing speech and sentiment analytics and supporting billing operations. We will continue this proactive approach to capture value using new technology.\nTo conclude, our operational agenda is driven by safety first, reliability, affordability and resiliency in our overall utility operations, including SCE's wildfire mitigation and industry-leading covered conductor program. Our financial agenda is very clear: deliver on our 2024 EPS guidance and achieve our EPS target for 2025. Our team and I are very committed to executing strongly, and we will continue to share our progress with you.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone.\nIn my comments today, I will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, SCE's CapEx and rate base opportunities and 2024 EPS guidance. I want to reaffirm our unwavering confidence in achieving our long-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2025. I'll elaborate on factors underpinning this confidence shortly.\nLet me begin with fourth quarter results. EIX reported core EPS of $1.28. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 9, core earnings grew by $0.13, primarily due to higher GRC revenue and lower O&M, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The parent company also had a gain on preferred stock repurchases. For the full year, EIX's core EPS of $4.76 was above the midpoint of our guidance range. For context, you will recall that we identified 2 specific items in this guidance. The pending CEMA decision and the tender offer for EIX' preferred stocks. The CEMA decision shifted into 2024 and the gain on the preferred stock repurchase was $0.04. I'm also pleased to inform you that our operational excellence initiatives are off to a solid start, and we are seeing this translate into higher operating efficiency throughout the business. This was reflected in better-than-expected SCE operational variances.\nSumming up our 2023 performance. The key takeaway is that we continue to manage the variability in the business and, yet again, deliver core EPS above the midpoint.\nPage 10 shows the components of our performance versus guidance.\nTurning to SCE's capital and rate base forecast shown on Pages 11 and 12, I want to emphasize 2 messages. First, SCE has a robust and high-quality capital investment plan for 2023 through 2028. The utility plans to invest $38 billion to $43 billion, the majority of which is in the distribution grid. This spending covers several critical areas, including infrastructure replacement, wildfire mitigation, load growth, new service connections and inspections and maintenance. This type of spending has been approved in prior GRCs, so we view these as high quality and lower risk. Moreover, they directly support California's leading role in transitioning to a carbon-free economy. Second, these forecasts do not incorporate substantial additional long-term CapEx opportunities in several areas. The utility will file stand-alone applications with the CPUC for the next-gen ERP and AMI 2.0 programs once they have been fully developed. On the FERC side, SCE is the incumbent transmission owner for 17 projects approved in CISO's transmission plan, which we expect will result in more than $2 billion of investments.\nTurning to 2024 EPS guidance. The range of $4.75 to $5.05 and modeling considerations are outlined on Page 13. As you can see, rate base earnings growth is strong, though our EPS guidance implies modest growth for the year. There are 3 primary reasons for this. First, interest expense on the wildfire settlement-related debt grows by about $0.16, driven by refinancing $2.1 billion of maturities and issuing additional debt to fund the balance of the claims resolutions. I want to be very clear that the utility expects to seek full CPUC cost recovery of all eligible claims payments, including financing costs. Second, SCE operational variance is $0.15 to $0.34 lower year-over-year. As we've noted, this captures SCE's variations from authorized levels. including such items as AFUDC, O&M, depreciation, financing and true-ups from regulatory approval. Pedro talked earlier about the planned increase in O&M as SCE's spends on targeted reliability-focused activities and redeploy savings into operational excellence initiatives. This accounts for 15% to 20% of the total year-over-year change. The utility continues to spend in its operations, including distribution, customer service and IT to support reliability and benefit customers in the long run. Third, parents and other costs are higher, primarily due to the absence of the gain on last year's preferred stock repurchase and also having a full year of interest on the junior subordinated notes issued in excess of the amounts needed to fund the repurchase.\nTurning to Page 14. I want to emphasize the strong underlying business growth that is being masked by the growing interest expense on wildfire claims debt. As you see on the chart, we are on track to achieve 5% to 7% core EPS growth for 2021 through 2025. This is despite the burden of about $325 million of pretax interest or $0.61 per share, which reduces our core EPS growth by 250 basis points over this period. On the other hand, this illustrates the substantial potential value from successful resolution of the cost recovery proceeding.\nI would now like to address the big increase in 2025 core EPS and share some insight into what makes us confident in delivering on our commitments. To do this, we are going beyond our typical 1-year forward guidance and providing a bridge between the midpoints of 2024 and 2025 core EPS guidance, which is on Page 15. The biggest contributor to earnings growth comes from an increase in rate base earnings. You will recall that for the last several years, we've been projecting rate base to increase by 11% to 14% in 2025. This step-up has 2 components. The first relates to the 2025 GRC, which in total drives $0.63 of the change. The drivers for this increase are 2025 CapEx and rate base true-ups including differences in the timing and mix of capital deployed over the prior rate case cycle. The second component relates to non-GRC applications to recover past wildfire mitigation and other spending as well as FERC jurisdictional investments. This represents the remaining $0.15. A significant portion of this relates to covered conductor insulation and other mitigation spending above what was authorized in SCE's 2021 GRC. Outside the rate base EPS, I want to underscore that operational variances are not a key driver, and its contribution is in line with historical levels. Further, we see wildfire interest expense moderating as the claim settlement process should be substantially complete and SCE has only $300 million of wildfire debt maturing in 2025.\nLet me summarize by saying that our confidence is underpinned by these growth drivers, further bolstered by the fact that headwinds in '24 are expected to moderate going into 2025.\nTurn to Page 16. Following an active year of capital market execution in 2023, our planned 2024 financing activities are minimal. In December, EIX prefunded $75 million of the $100 million annual equity need with our junior subordinated notes offering. The remainder will be addressed through internal programs by the end of Q1. As for the rest of the parent's funding needs, we expect to issue $500 million of debt to refinance the maturity.\nTurning to Page 17. We are also reiterating our core EPS growth target of 5% to 7% for 2025 through 2028, which only requires $100 million of equity per year. On the right side of the page, we've now laid out the consolidated sources and uses for this period.\nLet me conclude by saying our confidence in meeting our 2024 and 2025 EPS targets remain strong. Additionally, there are also potential value creation opportunities that are not factored into our guidance metrics or the company's equity value. These are cost recoveries for the 2017 and 2018 events, successfully executing our operational excellence program. The cornerstone for SCE's cost leadership and lowest system average rate among major IOUs in California and incremental CPUC and FERC growth investment opportunities. We look forward to executing on our plans and sharing progress on the next quarterly earnings call.\nThat concludes my remarks, and I'll pass it back over to Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nSheila, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions."

My name is Sue, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nToday's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sue, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today our President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.\nThe presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nAll right. Thanks, Sam, and good afternoon, everybody. Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.38 for the third quarter and $3.48 for the first 9 months of the year. We are pleased with our performance year-to-date. And combined with the outlook for the fourth quarter, we are content in reaffirming our 2023 core EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85. I would also like to reaffirm our ongoing commitment to delivering 5% [ to 7% ] core EPS growth for 2025, which does not factor in several potential upsides. We also reaffirm our EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7% for 2025 to 2028.\nMy comments today cover 4 key thoughts. First, an update on the legacy wildfires relating to a change in the best estimate. Second, how SCE's industry-leading wildfire mitigation practices differentiate the company as climate change-driven wildfire risk affects utilities across the nation. Third, several SCE regulatory updates, and then finally, Edison's updated projections on the dramatic grid expansion required to enable economy-wide electrification and the clean energy transition.\nStarting with SCE's legacy wildfires, as shown on Page 3. The process to resolve claims and estimate the final outcome is complex and challenging. And each quarter, SCE evaluates the estimated cost for resolving the remaining claims. The utility has made substantial progress settling claims and moving towards recovering these costs. However, this quarter's evaluation required SCE to increase the best estimate by $475 million, driven primarily by settlements being resolved at higher levels than originally estimated and assuming that trend will continue.\nSCE also now has more refined information about the types of claims being precepted as it works through the mediation process. The majority, about 2/3 of the increase is attributable to Woolsey. The impact of this increase on you, our shareholders, is not lost on us. As shareholders ourselves, we understand the importance of this issue behind us. Resolving all outstanding claims is crucial, and SCE is firmly committed to completing this in a reasonable and prudent manner that will ultimately support cost recovery.\nA positive step in this process is that recently a deadline was set for Woolsey claimants in the settlement protocol to fight SCE of their complete claims by February 2024. After then, SCE will have increased clarity on the remaining value of claims and the utility's ability to swiftly resolve them. As always, we will continue to update you each quarter including SCE's expectation for when it will file the cost recovery application for the Woolsey Fire. The Woolsey application will cover more than $4 billion of eligible claims payments plus financing and legal costs.\nWe recognize that utilities across the country are facing new challenges from wildfires, which were initially viewed as specific to California, but have expanded to become an international issue. Against this backdrop, SCE has made tremendous progress since 2018, reducing its risk of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 85%. SCE has differentiated itself through its multilayered wildfire mitigation strategy. This is anchored by grid hardening and includes enhanced vegetation management, asset inspections and other programs.\nSCE has replaced 5,200 miles of distribution lines with covered conductor. And in fact, by year-end, SCE will have physically hardened over 75% of its distribution miles in high-fire risk areas. Growth mitigation, the uncovered conductor includes one of the largest private weather station networks in the country and enhanced protective settings known as fast With their deep experience and achievements, my SCE colleagues are sharing mitigation strategies with utilities across the country.\nMoving to the regulatory front, I'd like to provide 3 updates. First, in August, SCE delivered on its commitment to file its TKM cost recovery application requesting recovery of $2.4 billion. SCE provided a compelling case that a prudently designed, managed and operated its equipment and that the associated costs were recently incurred. The evidence provided shows that the damages resulted from extraordinary environmental conditions and other factors beyond SCE's control. Expert testimony estimates that a reasonable decision could save customers as much as $4.9 billion by avoiding excess financing costs for SCE debt issued over the next 10 years, making it more affordable to achieve economy-wide electrification.\nAs for next steps, the commission will issue a scoping memo that will set the procedural schedule. Second, in September, SCE filed an unopposed motion for the CPUC to approve a settlement on track 4 of its 2021 GRC, which sets the revenue requirement for 2024. Reaching this agreement with intervenors is a successful outcome for the utility and its customers, and SCE has sought CPUC approval by the end of the year. Maria will provide additional details in her remarks.\nThird, at the end of September, the cost of capital mechanism triggered resulting in a 70 basis point increase to SCE's return on equity, effective January 1, 2024. SCE filed a Tier 2 advice letter on October 13 to implement the update to its ROE along with the cost of debt and preferred equity. The response period for intervenors ends tomorrow, after which the CPUC's energy division can approve it or refer to the full CPUC.\nConsistent with our usual practice, we will provide 2024 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. I would like to reiterate that our EPS growth through 2025 is achievable at SCE's currently authorized ROE and this increase is one of the upsides I mentioned earlier in my remarks.\nI now want to share a recent achievement and recognition of our company's strong corporate governance. The Center for Political Accountability and Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research recently published our annual index, which is the marquee measurement of corporate political transparency and accountable. For the second consecutive year, Edison International received a perfect score, and we were recognized as a corporate leader for the tenth consecutive year. I am very proud of our team for this accomplishment, and our continued commitment to integrity and transparency.\nAnd now putting my current Edison Electric Institute Chair hat on, I am also proud to say that 17 other utilities were also identified as trend setters, which are S&P 500 companies with CPA Zicklin Index scores, indicating robust disclosure and oversight.\nEdison has been a thought leader on the clean energy transition for many years and has published numerous white papers about how California can achieve it. In September, we published Countdown to 2045, our latest analysis. This updates the earlier Pathway 2045 war, reflecting new laws and policies, technology advances and customer adoption while leveraging the latest modeling in climate science. We conclude that for California to achieve its net-zero greenhouse gas emission goals in just over 2 decades, the electric grid must expand faster than ever before to levels higher than we previously estimated. Page 4 shows some top line findings on how the state gets to carbon neutrality. We forecast an 80% increase in electrical demand by 2045, due in part to 90% of vehicles and 95% of buildings going electric. To serve all this load, the grid will need to expand to handle 3x the clean energy flowing today. This means new transmission and distribution grid projects will need to be added at 4x and 10x their historical rates, respectively.\nImportantly, though, the average household is going to save about 40% on their overall annual energy expenses by 2045 due to reduced fossil fuel spending and the greater efficiency of electric vehicles and appliances. This unprecedented pace of grid buildout needed to electrify the economy requires bold actions to improve how the state's entire energy infrastructure is planned and operated. At Edison, we are deeply committed to helping California reach its ambitious goal to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ceased a set of approaches outlining in Countdown to 2045 as a model for other states and nations.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will cover third quarter results, discuss our 2023 EPA guidance and provide additional insight into our long-term core EPS growth expectations. Starting with third quarter of 2023, EIX reported core EPS of $1.38. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 5, SCE's third quarter earnings saw a $0.03 decrease.\nRecall that during this period last year, SCE received a CPUC final decision on its customer service replatform project and recorded a $0.09 true-up. This results in an unfavorable year-over-year comparison for this quarter. I will highlight 2 additional key variances. SCE's earnings were driven by an increase in revenue due to the GRC escalation mechanism partially offset higher interest expense. At EIX Parent and Other, there was a negative variance of $0.07, primarily due to higher holding company interest expense.\nOverall, we are pleased with our performance in the first 9 months of the year, and combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are confident in reaffirming our full year core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85. I'll cover this in more detail in a few minutes.\nOn Page 6, we've updated the capital forecast to incorporate the GRC track 4 settlement agreement and assumptions about the timing for certain projects. The key message here is that we continue to see $38 million to $43 billion of capital investment opportunities from 2023 through 2028.\nTurning to Page 7. Our capital plan supports approximately 6% to 8% rate base growth from 2023 to 2028. Let me emphasize that SCE is an electric-only transmission and distribution focused utility, which benefits from several strong regulatory mechanisms and competitive ROEs. So we see this rate base growth is high quality and lower risk since it is driven by the crucial grid infrastructure needed to facilitate California's leading role in transitioning to a carbon-free economy.\nAs outlined in our Countdown to 2045 analysis, unprecedented grid expansion is needed to keep pace with long-term system-wide resource capacity growth. For a sense of scale, because of the upgrades and additions needed for distribution circuits, substations, transformers and conductors, SCE expects to have a 25% larger distribution system by 2045. This significant expansion in the grid makes us confident in the long-term investment opportunity here in California.\nBefore I discuss our outlook for 2023 and beyond, I'd like to point out 2 key opportunities we have identified that would have certainty around our future financing needs and financial outlook. First, SCE will be filing an application with the CPUC tomorrow that would allow the utility to monetize its current portfolio of contracts with wireless providers and future contracting opportunities on its transmission infrastructure. The utility currently has more than 850 leases of space on transmission towers and other structures that wireless providers use to attach their equipment. SCE is making this filing prior to the marketing of these assets to shorten the time line leading to final regulatory approval.\nThe contract the utility expects to monetize generate nearly $20 million in annual revenue. This transaction will financially benefit customers. And for shareholders, this is an efficient form of financing that can reduce the need for equity in the future. We will keep you updated as the transaction progresses.\nSecond, EIX recently announced a $750 million tender offer for its outstanding preferred stock. This offer would be funded with debt issuances such as junior subordinated notes or JSNs. By funding the repurchase with JSNs, we will replace the equity content of the preferred stock. Overall, the transaction will simultaneously delever the balance sheet and reduce our interest rate exposure. Let me underscore that this transaction creates near- and long-term financial benefits. In 2023, we would recognize core EPS of about $0.02 for every $100 million of preferred stock tendered. In 2026 and beyond, we will have locked in lower after-tax financing costs compared to the expected reset rates for the preferred stock. These 2 opportunities build on our track record of successfully identifying ways to manage the is even more efficiently and executing to create additional value.\nAs shown on Page 8, we are reaffirming our 2023 core EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the rest of the year, we are confident in delivering on this target. Recall that this guidance includes $0.14 related to SCE's 2022 CEMA application. The CPUC recently extended the proceeding statutory deadline April 2024, but there still is a possibility of a final decision by year-end. Together with the tender offer, these 2 items could put us at the top end of our guidance range. However, if the CEMA final decision occurs in 2024, we will realize those earnings in that year.\nPage 9 gives you an update on our accomplishments to date in regarding to our 2023 financing plan. The financing transaction so far this year have been in line with our expectations and supported by strong investor response. As I mentioned a moment ago, we've opportunistically added a new component to our plan with the tender offer and look forward to executing another successful transaction.\nOn the regulatory front, I'd like to expand on a couple of Pedro's earlier points. First, to provide some detail on GRC track 4, the agreement with interveners would authorize 98% of SCE's requested revenue requirements and 99% of its requested rate base. The key takeaway here is that once approved by the CPUC, the agreement will provide clarity on 2024 revenue and translate to $0.12 in incremental rate base EPS over 2023. Consistent with our typical practice, we will provide 2024 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nSecond, as shown on Page 10, the cost of capital mechanism triggered a 70 basis point ROE increase, resulting in 2024 and 2025 CPUC ROEs of 10.75%. This benefits 2025 EPS by approximately $0.39. The mechanism provides hedge against future increases in interest rates above the levels embedded in our 2025 guidance of $5.50 to $5.90. In terms of operational drivers, we are confident that we will deliver results within the range shown in the modeling considerations. SCE is also evaluating opportunities to reinvest a portion of the $0.39 to accelerate initiatives that would benefit safety, quality and affordability for customers. This investment would enable a utility to capture savings sooner, thereby providing a strong base for long-term customer benefits. I will share more on this front over time.\nI want to reiterate the high confidence we have in our ability to achieve our 2025 and 2028 EPS growth targets. In addition to our strong rate base growth, we also see upside opportunities. We are looking forward to delivering our targeted EPS growth, which sets the foundation for an attractive total return proposition.\nThat concludes my remarks. And with that, I'll hand it back to Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nSue, can you please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nWell, thanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin with 3 financial comments. First, driven by EIX's impressive performance through June, we are confident in our 2023 core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85. Second, we remain fully confident in and deeply committed to delivering our long-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2025. This target incorporates all known business headwinds, but does not factor in potential tailwinds. Which could present significant upside. Third, based on the strength of SCE's 2025 GRC application and other investment opportunities, we are providing EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7% for 2025 to 2028, which provides the path towards $7 in earnings per share potential for 2028. Underpinning this is the rate base growth driven by the essential investments to advance California's clean energy transition. Importantly, these actions will maintain SCE's cost leadership and the lowest system average rates for customers among California's investor utilities for the foreseeable future. We are very proud of this commitment, and I'll share more about it later.\nOn the operational front, my 2 key messages today are: Well, first, SCE is strategically positioned to make substantial investments in the reliability, resiliency and readiness of the grid as outlined in its 2025 GRC application. And second, SCE is well prepared for the wildfire season due to its successful grid hardening actions. I will also emphasize that core to everything that we do is sustainability. As Edison International remains at the forefront of the clean energy transition.\nPlease turn to Page 3. On May 12, SCE filed its 2025 GRC application. The overarching objectives are to ensure the greatest reliable, resilient and ready, reliable so that it can meet customers' needs today and in the future. Resilient to protect public safety and the integrity of the grid and ready to support the widespread electrification and decarbonization needed to meet California's ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals. These GHG reduction goals are not just stretch targets. They are deeply embedded in the fabric of California's most important legislative and policy frameworks. Mindful of the longer-term cost of an action when confronting the global climate crisis, SCE's GRC reflects that urgent need for the state to rapidly electrify best swaps to the economy which is facing the fastest electricity demand growth in decades. To meet these objectives, SCE requested a 2025 base revenue requirement of $10.3 billion. That's an increase of $1.9 billion or about 12% of our total 2024 rates. This also represents a system average rate increase of 9% and an average residential customer bill increase of 10%. The 2025 to 2028 period will be critical to achieving California's 2030 and 2045 climate goals. SCE will continue to make substantial investments in wildfire mitigation to address the remaining wildfire risk on the system. There is also a need to ramp up infrastructure replacement work, returning to historical levels of proactive replacement to safeguard reliability.\nTwo key themes are always top of mind in any of SCE's applications and frankly, and how the company runs. Those are operational excellence and affordability for customers. We recognize that the investments in the grid are borne by customers, so we continuously look for ways to gain efficiencies and save customers money. SCE has been building its capabilities in artificial intelligence and advancing the integration of technology into its operations. In 2018, SCE began to apply technology to some of its highest priority challenges, including wildfire risk mitigation and data quality. SCE has implemented several computer vision algorithms as part of the T&D aerial inspection process. To scan images and detect defects like broken crossarms and other failure risks that could lead to outages or additions. The utility is now leveraging its images, other data and these algorithms to develop other predictive models that can identify and refine asset data to more efficiently operate the grid, enhance fire spread modeling and better prioritize grid hardening efforts. Building on this and further leveraging tools such as artificial intelligence, robotic process automation and mobile solutions, SCE is ramping up its efforts around the customer experience, integrated grid planning and execution and driving efficiencies in its support functions. Examples include predicting customer issues before they call and proactively addressing them or diverting them to the lowest cost, most effective channel. Leveraging speech and image recognition and inspections to automatically fill out surveys and focus the inspections and using generative AI to create first drafts of everything from communications to data request responses. I am really proud that SCE is an early mover in implementing new technology that furthers its operational excellence and affordability goals.\nTurning to Page 4. Let me give you a brief update on the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. SCE is putting finishing touches on the TKM cost recovery application and expects to file in August. I reiterate that SCE will seek full CPUC cost recovery, excluding amounts already recovered or foregone under the agreement with the Safety and Enforcement Division. SCE will show a strong, compelling case that it operated its system prudently and that it is in the public interest to authorize full cost recovery. Looking at this year's wildfire season. SCE's confidence in mitigating wildfires associated with its equipment continues to grow. Over the past couple of years, SCE has deployed covered conductor at a rate of approximately 100 miles per month. And has now replaced nearly 5,000 circuit miles of bare wire with covered conductor since the inception of this program of around 4.5 years ago. In addition to the CPUC and doors grid hardening measure, completes 360-degree inspections of its transmission and distribution structures that represent up to 99% of risk each year prior to peak filer season and then performs repairs and replacements. SCE continues its robust vegetation management programs, inspecting 1.6 million trees across the service area annually. And typically mitigating approximately $850,000. More than half of those trees are in high fire risk areas. In 2023, SCE plans to inspect over 130,000 trees that post a threat of falling into SCE's electrical equipment in the highest risk locations.\nNow let me give you some proof points of how well this is all working to reduce ignitions and their impacts. On fully covered segments, there have not been any ignitions due to failure of covered conductor. In 2021 and 2022, there were 98% fewer structures destroyed and 92% fewer acres burned than in 2017 and 2018. These and a lot of other statistics are shown on Page 5.\nAs it has since 2021, SCE uses a rigorous insurance industry modeling approach to estimate the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires relative to the thresholds defined by AB 1054. Incorporating SCE's latest mitigation data into the industry-leading North America wildfire HD model. Moody's RMS now estimates SCE has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 85% compared to pre-2018 levels as highlighted on Page 6. Importantly, the contribution from public safety power shutoffs continues to decline, and it's now only 10%. SCE has been expeditiously hardening its grid since 2018 and with 76% of distribution lines in HFRA expected to be hardened by year-end, which you can see on Page 7. SCE anticipates ramping down its flagship mitigation measure of covered conductor beginning in 2025. And also largely completing its targeted undergrounding work by the end of 2028.\nMeanwhile, the State of California continues to allocate substantial funding to forest resiliency and to fire suppression. And this includes CAL FIRE Cruise and aerial Resources. We were pleased that the approve state budget maintained $2.7 billion. That was 98% of the original proposal. Over 4 years, for critical investments restoring forests and wild land health to continue reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires in the face of extreme climate conditions. To put the state's commitment in context, the total 2023 to '24 Cal Fire budget of $4.1 billion is double what was originally enacted in the 2017 to '18 budget. And CAL FIRE staffing has increased by 74% since that.\nEdison International remains at the forefront of the clean energy transition, and we continue to execute on our strategy and commitment. As climate change continues to challenge our world in unprecedented ways, I am confident in the strength of our team to lead the transition affordably and effectively. We're paying the way for future power by 100% carbon-free electricity, adapting our system to climate change and supporting customers in reaching net-zero emissions. While the road ahead is long, our 2022 progress demonstrates our sense of urgency and our ongoing commitment to sustainability. I want to encourage you to read our 2022 sustainability report, it has details about our accomplishments, our goals and our long-term ESG commitments.\nLet me highlight just a few commitments, and these are covered on Pages 8 and 9. In 2022, SCE delivered 45% carbon-free power to customers, installed the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to enable customers to add more than 500 medium and heavy-duty electric vehicles, and installed or contracted for more than 1,800 megawatts of energy storage. By year-end, SCE's energy storage portfolio totaled more than 5,000 megawatts. That's one of the largest in the nation. Our team continues to forge coalitions nationally and internationally to address climate change, and we are proud to lead the way on these initiatives and partnerships and to support our stakeholders. A future powered by clean electricity is upon us. So we stand fully ready to make this future a reality. And we're going to do that reliably, affordably and sustainably. With that, let me turn it over to Maria.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will discuss second quarter results, our 2023 EPS guidance and provide some additional insight into our long-term core EPS growth expectations. Starting with the second quarter of 2023, EIX reported core EPS of $1.01. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 10, SCE's second quarter earnings saw a $0.13 increase. Among the major items, GRC attrition year revenue escalation added $0.19 year-over-year. Additionally, higher FERC and other revenue added $0.04, and there was a $0.10 increase related to balancing account interest income. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in interest expense of $0.16 driven by higher interest rates associated with funding wildfire claims payments. At EIX Parent and Other, there was a negative variance of $0.06, primarily due to higher holding company interest expense. Overall, we are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and are confident in delivering on our full year core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85 laid out on Page 11, which we are reaffirming today. .\nI will now discuss SCE's capital expenditure forecast shown on Page 12. Following SCE's 2025 GRC filing in May, we introduced our 2023 through 2028 capital plan of $38 billion to $43 billion. Underpinned by spending covered by SCE's 2021 and 2025 general rate cases. During the 2025 GRC cycle, which extends through 2028, we project annual capital deployment to be in the $8 billion range, which is double the level from only 6 years ago. Over 85% of SCE's investments are in its distribution grid. These are essential to meeting reliability, resiliency and readiness objectives that support the widespread electrification and decarbonization needed to meet California's greenhouse gas reduction goals. You may ask, how do you plan to finance a significant step-up in CapEx? The vast majority will be financed with cash from operations and debt, Between 2025 and 2028, we expect our equity needs will be fulfilled using internal programs, which typically bring in about $100 million of equity annually, totaling about $400 million over the period. We expect this financing plan to keep us within the 15% to 17% FFO to debt range through 2028. As a reminder, this financing plan does not incorporate potential cost recovery in the legacy wildfire proceedings.\nI want to highlight that SCE's capital expenditure forecast does not include substantial additional capital deployment opportunities. There is at least $2 billion of potential investment that SCE will request in stand-alone applications over the next couple of years. As you may recall, filing stand-alone applications in California is typical when major projects are still in early stages at the time GRC testimony is developed. Let me give you some historical perspective. You can see on Page 13 that SCE has obtained approvals of stand-alone applications for approximately $3 billion of capital spending over the past 2 rate case cycles. Discrete applications have contributed meaningful growth in the past and we expect that to continue in the future. To wrap up my comments on the upside opportunities, CISO's recently approved transmission plan identified 17 projects that upgrade SCE's existing facilities. As the incumbent transmission owner, these projects represent at least $2.3 billion of FERC transmission investment for SCE. The CISO plan also identified $3 billion of competitive projects in Southern California that SCE will be able to compete for.\nTurning to Page 14. SCE's GRC request supports approximately 6% to 8% rate base growth. Starting from a 2023 base of $41.9 billion, which itself is nearly 20% higher than only 2 years ago. Rate base growth through 2028 is driven by the crucial grid infrastructure needed to facilitate California's leading role in transitioning to a carbon-free economy. Page 15 shows our progress in successfully executing the parent company's 2023 financing plan. SCE and the parent issued debt during the quarter and both transactions were well within our average projected refinancing rates by 2025. Further bolstering our confidence in achieving our 2025 EPS guidance.\nPage 16 provides an update on the CPUC cost of capital mechanism. Given that the Moody's BAA utility bond index is trading well above the deadband with only 2 months remaining in the annual measurement period, it is likely the mechanism will trigger. We believe an upward ROE adjustment is justified given the current interest rate environment has increased the utility cost of capital in line with the overall financial markets. Once triggered, as CE will file an advice letter to implement the adjustment to the 2024 ROE and update the cost of debt and preferred equity. The CPUC equity ratio will remain at 52% on an adjusted basis. Consistent with the proposed decision issued yesterday afternoon to extend SCE's capital structure waiver for 2 years or until final decisions have been made on cost recovery for the 2017 and 2018 events.\nI've previously discussed our operational excellence program, and noted that we would share updates along the way. SCE's employee-driven ideas have identified O&M savings for customers that are already reflected in the GRC request. We work tirelessly to continue fleshing out these ideas and finding additional benefits for customers irrespective of the GRC cycle. I'm pleased to share some tangible examples of our successful efforts to find efficiencies, which you can see on Page 17. Starting on the left side, in May, the CPUC approved SCE's expanded wildfire self-insurance program, which saves customers approximately $160 million per year and has the potential for greater long-term savings. In the category of work planning, we've successfully implemented our wildfire mitigation plan year in and year out and have continually found ways to improve. To give you an example, SCE programmatically inspects about 216,000 structures in high fire risk areas every year from the ground and the air, which in the past was performed by distinct teams. We have transformed the program by combining ground and aerial inspections into a single 360-degree inspection process. This reduces driving time in the field benefit safety for field personnel and improve overall quality and customer experience. Through this effort, we expect to generate nearly $55 million in cumulative O&M savings.\nIn the category of procurement, we are successfully finding ways to buy better. We recently reevaluated the prescription benefit provider in our healthcare plans and switch vendors, achieving about $15 million of cumulative O&M savings while maintaining the level of benefits and service for our employees. These are just representative examples that clearly demonstrate the value our team can uncover and implement in a short period of time. We are excited about such opportunities to provide savings to customers, and we will continue to share additional examples with you in the future.\nTurning to our financial commitments. We remain confident in our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate guidance from 2021 through 2025. I reiterate our management team's steadfast focus on delivering this growth. Additionally, for the 2025 to 2028 period, we expect to continue core EPS growth of 5% to 7%, which provides a pathway towards $7 earnings per share potential for 2028 shown on Page 18. We do further understand this pathway, we have also provided some key sensitivities on Page 25 of the appendix.\nWe see this long-term EPS growth as highly achievable for 3 primary reasons. First, the core driver for this earnings trajectory is SCE's strong rate base growth. Second, the headwinds we have navigated over the past couple of years will have mostly stabilized by 2025. Allowing for a simplified growth story through 2028. These past headwinds included the cost of financing wildfire claims payments, driven by both the increase in legacy wild bio reserves and higher interest rate environment. the reduction in CPUC ROE and issuance of preferred equity at the parent to strengthen the balance sheet. Taking these into consideration, you can see that the midpoint of our 2025 guidance provides a stable platform for a strong long-term growth trajectory. Third, this growth is achievable even without incorporating a few key items. We can achieve this growth at SCE's current authorized ROEs and rate base forecast without factoring in the additional capital, potential I mentioned earlier or upside to the cost of capital by 2028. Additionally, we have not incorporated potential cost recovery in the legacy wildfire proceedings. Which clearly presents substantial upside value to our long-term earnings power and credit profile. Based on these factors, I want to underscore, we see 5% to 7% growth as highly achievable. We firmly believe we can achieve our targeted growth, both through 2025 and 2028 based on SCE's significant investment to ensure the grid is reliable, resilient and ready for California's economy-wide clean energy transition. That concludes my remarks. Back over to you, Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nFran, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, my request to you to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions. ."

My name is ted, I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Ted, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.\nThe presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Edison International\n\nThanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everybody. Edison International's core EPS for first quarter 2023 was $1.09. We are pleased with our start to the year, and we are confident in affirming our 2023 core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85 We also remain confident in delivering our long-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nMy key message today is that we continue to see a number of positives in the near term and in the long term. And these make us excited for our company's future. SCE's actions to sustain and strengthen the electric grid, mitigate wildfires and enable the carbonization through electrification are critically needed by California and are increasing our investment opportunity.\nIn the longer term, our Pathway 2045 analysis highlights the continued investment in transmission and distribution needed to evolve the grid. This is being recognized by regulators in California.\nIn 2021, the California ISO released a 20-year plan, estimating about $30 billion of transmission investments needed through 2040, consistent with our Pathway analysis. Only a few weeks ago, CAISO published its Draft 2022 to 2023 Transmission Plan, with its current thinking on system needs over the next 10 years. Their draft plan calls for 46 transmission projects with a total estimated cost of $9.3 billion. Over $2 billion of that represents proposed incumbent projects for SCE and over $5 billion represents FERC Order 1000 competitive projects within Southern California for which SCE will be able to compete.\nIn the near term, SCE continues its diligent execution of its wildfire mitigation plan and has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 75% to 80% compared to pre-2018 levels. predominantly from grid hardening measures that allow the utility to mitigate risk while keeping electricity flowing to our customers.\nI want to say thanks again to the many of you who visited us in person at our headquarters and heard directly from several of our leaders about the utility's achievements and ongoing actions.\nIn March, SCE filed its 2023 to 2025 WMP with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Highlights of the plan are shown on Page 3. Our #1 priority remains the safety of the public, customers, workers and first responders. In 2023, the utility is building on the work already accomplished while focusing on 5 key areas. These are: Continuing to harden the grid, ramping up targeted undergrounding work in severe risk areas, continuing to reduce PSPS impacts, expanding aerial fire suppression funding to year-round and further in technological advancements.\nSCE's flagship grid hardening program, covered conductor, remains its key mitigation measure. More than 2,850 additional miles of covered conductor will be installed between 2023 and 2025. By the end of 2025, SCE expects to have replaced more than 7,200 miles are about 3/4 of overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor.\nSCE also plans to complete about 100 miles of undergrounding by 2025 to address the high risk presented by unique factors in certain areas and plans to underground a total of 600 miles by the end of 2028. Additionally, to quickly suppress fires regardless of how they start and protect the communities SCE serves, the utility continues to partner with the LA County Fire Department, Orange County Fire Authority and Ventura County Fire Department to expand their firefighting capabilities.\nAs highlighted in the WMP, this support has been expanded to year-round aerial fire suppression from the Quick Reaction force, made up of the world's largest fire suppression helicopters with unique night firefighting capabilities.\nThe WMP is adaptive, and it's focused on furthering technological advancements to find new ways to mitigate wildfire risk. SCE is continuously developing new approaches and collaborating with other utilities, with academia and with the energy sector to make our community safer. The WMP highlights technologies such as the Rapid Earth Current Limiter, Early Fault Detection and using artificial intelligence that will continue to advance our suite of wildfire mitigation measures.\nGoing back to the long-term deal, a key driver for SCE's investment in the grid and for enabling customer affordability is transportation electrification. Now we aren't just talking here about regulatory policies or long-term forecasts. We are seeing customers really start to embrace and adopt EVs today, including operators of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle fleets.\nSCE was an early mover and today has the country's largest suite of transportation electrification programs led by an investor-owned utility with over $800 million in approved funding for its Charge Ready programs which include a program aimed at the medium- and heavy-duty segment.\nMomentum and customer interest have certainly increased, and we are beginning to see vehicle availability improvements in the heavy-duty segment with more options available to order. SCE is currently working with nearly 200 sites to potentially support approximately 4,000 medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Customers operating heavy-duty vehicles are requesting higher power chargers, resulting in larger load requests that may require additional distribution system upgrades to ensure adequate capacity is available.\nSCE continues to engage with these customers to understand when and where these vehicles will materialize to ensure the grid is ready. Beyond transportation electrification, building electrification is another critical opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SCE has proposed a $677 million program to help catalyze the adoption of the electric heat pumps and that is currently being reviewed by the CPUC.\nI will conclude by noting that even as SCE makes substantial investment in the grid to keep the utility and the state on track, for decarbonization and electrification efforts, affordability is always top of mind. SCE's long-standing culture of actively pursuing and maintaining productivity improvement and cost control measures has enabled it to have the lowest system average rate among California industrial and utilities.\nSome recent examples include the pending settlement agreement with TURN and Cal Advocates to move to a customer-funded wildfire self-insurance model and SCE's operational excellence program, which includes over 600 employee-driven ideas with capital efficiency and O&M benefits. These include work planning, procurement and technology as shown on Page 4.\nBeyond these, we will constantly pursue new opportunities for our digitization, automation, and generative artificial intelligence to drive further improvements in customer interactions, asset data quality and back office efficiencies. The expected benefits should progressively increase as we accelerate implementation through 2024 and beyond, further benefiting affordability for SCE's customers. With that, Maria will provide her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will discuss first quarter results, our 2023 EPS guidance, our 2023 financing plan and other financial topics.\nStarting with the first quarter of 2023, EIX reported core EPS of $1.09. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 5, SCE's first quarter earnings increased primarily due to GRC attrition year escalation. This was partially offset by higher net interest expense, driven by higher interest rates associated with funding 2017 and 2018 wildfire claims payments.\nAt EIX Parent and Other, there was a negative variance of $0.04 due to higher holding company interest expense.\nI would now like to discuss SCE's capital and rate base forecast shown on Pages 6 and 7. These are consistent with last quarter's disclosure. SCE will file its 2025 GRC application in mid-May, and we will update our capital and rate base projections and extend them through 2028 at that time.\nOver the coming years, SCE will continue to invest in wildfire mitigation and increase its grid work to meet the needs of its customers while also supporting California's leading role in building a carbon-free economy. You can see this increased investment begin in our projections for 2025 capital spending, which is just under $7 billion.\nAs a point of reference, only 6 years ago, our annual CapEx was less than $4 billion.\nLet me provide a brief update on the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. As outlined on Page 8, in the first quarter, SCE resolved about $148 million in individual plaintiff claims. This continued progress settling claims enables us to move further along in resolving these historical events. Naturally, as we proceed towards full resolution, we continue to gain more and more information.\nEach quarter, we take our cumulative experience into account as we refine the best estimates. Consequently, SCE adjusted the best estimate upward by $90 million. More importantly, with this progress, the utility remains confident that it will file the TKM cost recovery application in the third quarter of this year. Our message is very clear. SCE will seek full CPUC cost recovery, excluding amounts forgone under the agreement with the Safety Enforcement Division or already recovered.\nSCE will show its strong compelling case that it operated its system prudently and that it is in the public interest to authorize full cost recovery.\nTurning to guidance. Page 9 shows our 2023 EPS guidance and the key assumptions for modeling purposes. We are pleased with our start to the year and are confident in affirming our 2023 core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85.\nProgress related to the parent company's 2023 financing plan is shown on Page 10. In March, we issued $500 million of junior subordinated notes, which provided $250 million of equity content. The transaction was in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see strong investor support for this offering, which was significantly oversubscribed.\nWe expect to generate approximately $100 million of equity through internal programs consistent with the $300 million to $400 million of equity content in our financing plan.\nTo add another highlight on the financing front, just last week, SCE closed on a securitization financing for the final portion of the $1.6 billion in AB 1054 capital expenditures. SCE saw a very robust investor engagement for the $775 million offering. This resulted in a cost-effective transaction for SCE's customers and allow the utility to repay an outstanding term loan, further improving its credit profile.\nPlease turn to Page 11. In addition to growing investor support, we are seeing our strengthening business and credit profile reflected in the rating agency's outlook. In February, Moody's upgraded EIX and SCE's credit ratings by 1 notch reflecting the decline in wildfire risk facing SCE. Additionally, last week, Fitch upgraded EIX and SCE's credit ratings by 1 notch, noting the meaningful decline in major wildfires linked to SCE's equipment post 2018, despite elevated wildfire activity in California in 2020 and 2021, and ongoing efforts to enhance system resilience while mitigating reliance on and frequency of public safety power shutoffs.\nPage 12 provides an update on the CPUC cost of capital mechanism. If the 12-month average of the Moody's Baa utility bond index exceeds 5.37% at the end of September, SCE will file a Tier 2 advice letter to implement the adjustment to the 2024 ROE. The adjustment would be equal to half the difference between the average and 4.37%. The mechanism also updates the authorized cost of debt and preferred equity.\nThrough April 25, the measurement period average is around 5.7%. We will continue monitoring the cost of capital mechanism, which could result in significant upside to 2024 earnings should it trigger.\nLooking ahead, we are reiterating our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate guidance from 2021 through 2025, which translates to 2025 EPS of $5.50 to $5.90. My management team and I are fully committed to delivering on this target. We will provide an update on our EPS growth rate projections through 2028 on our Q2 earnings call.\nWith strong rate base growth as the underlying driver, coupled with the significant investment needed in our electric grid, we continue to be optimistic about the company's growth prospects, both near and long term. That concludes my remarks. Sam?\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nTed, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we [indiscernible] to you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions."

I am pleased to report that Edison International's core EPS for 2022 was $4.63, which was in the upper end of our initial guidance range. Today, we are introducing 2023 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85 and we are reinforcing our strong confidence in delivering our long-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nSo let's start with our key accomplishments in 2022, and they're noted on Page 3. First, we once again delivered on our annual EPS guidance, as I just mentioned. Second, SCE continued to make tremendous progress in reducing wildfire risk and PSPS. SCE successfully executed its wildfire mitigation plan and updated the key statistics shown on Page 5. That is that SCE now estimates it has reduced the probability of losses of catastrophic wildfires by 75% to 80% compared to pre-2018 levels and critically with much lower reliance on PSPS, now only 15%, as hardening and other mitigations continue as depicted on Page 6. Despite the strong operational and financial performance, market sentiment impacted our total shareholder return. Our TSR for 2022 trailed that of the Philadelphia Utility sector index and most of our peers.\nAs shareholders ourselves, our leadership team and I are deeply committed to achieving our financial targets while strengthening SCE's ability to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and increasingly clean electricity. Diving deeper into SCE's tremendous progress in wildfire mitigation. Despite challenging weather conditions and some fires in our service area last year, 2022 marks the fourth consecutive year without a catastrophic wildfire associated with SCE's infrastructure. Key achievements in 2022 included deploying about 1,400 circuit miles of covered conductor, bringing total installations to around 4,400 circuit miles. To put this in perspective, this is nearly the round-trip distance from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.\nSo I am extremely proud of SCE's ongoing execution of grid hardening activities, which have made our communities safer. The utility is targeting up to another 1,200 miles of covered conductor in 2023. By year-end, approximately 74% of total distribution lines in high fire risk areas, or HFRA, including the 7,000 miles already underground are expected to be hardened. This is a significant achievement, and it is summarized on Page 7. The SCE completed its 1 million high fire risk inspection in 2019, which is like visiting every structure in HFRA at least 3x.\nThe utility continues to build out its network of weather stations and now with more than 1,600 in total, SCE has the largest privately-owned weather station network in the country providing a granular view of weather-related risk to inform operations. A key result is that total acres burned from ignitions on hardened sections of our grid are 99% smaller than those in areas not yet hardened. SCE's approach to reducing wildfire risk is differentiated by the speed of its infrastructure hardening and by reducing reliance on measures that affect customer reliability like PSPS, for example, by prioritizing hardening circuits at risk of power shutoffs.\nBy the end of the 2023 through 2025 wildfire mitigation plan, SCE will have hardened about 7,700 miles of its overhead distribution system and scaled innovative pilots, such as Early Fault Detection. We look forward to SCE's continued success in reducing the greatest amount of wildfire risk in the shortest amount of time. Turning to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events outlined on Page 8. In the fourth quarter, SCE paid about $280 million in claims settlements. SCE now targets filing the TKM cost recovery application in the third quarter of 2023.\nLet me emphasize that SCE will seek full CPUC cost recovery, excluding amounts forgone under the agreement with the Safety Enforcement Division or already recovered. SCE will show its strong, compelling case that it operated the system prudently and that it is in the public interest to authorize full cost recovery. The utility currently expects to request about $2 billion in this first application. Our financial assumptions for 2025 and beyond do not factor in any potential upside from the cost recovery applications, which would represent substantial value. Looking ahead, I want to highlight key management focus areas for 2023. These are laid out on Page 9.\nFirst and foremost, safety is foundational to our values and success, and we are targeting reducing the rates of employee injuries by 15%. Tragically, a utility troubleman, Johnny Kinkade, died from a work-related injury last month, and 1,200 of us joined his loved ones at his memorial service last week. This was our first employee work-related fatality in 5.5 years, and it redoubled my resolve and it redoubled our team's resolve to make it our very last. SCE is unwavering commitment to keeping our communities safe through wildfire mitigation also continues. The utility plans to keep its pace of about 100 miles per month of covered conductor, reaching a total of 5,600 miles by year-end. Again, filing the first cost recovery application for the historical wildfires is a front-and-center focus area for us.\nOn the regulatory front, SCE looks forward to its upcoming 2025 GRC application and will monitor the cost of capital mechanism, which could result in significant upside to 2024 earnings should it trigger. On the financial side, we will be focused on achieving our capital expenditure and earnings goals, as well as pursuing upgrades to our credit ratings. We believe this is well warranted considering the significant wildfire risk reduction by SCE, the state's strong firefighting capabilities, and supportive California regulation.\nLooking to the future. The support for economy-wide electrification continues to grow nationally and here in California. We've shared before with you that we forecast electricity usage growing 60% by 2045. That's a big 6-0. And previously, we projected almost flat annual growth through 2030 followed by a steep trajectory to 2045, but we are now seeing earlier increases with the breadth of legislation, regulations, and codes and standards approved last year. SCE has updated its electricity sales forecast to reflect the significant policy changes and now projects about 2% annual growth from 2023 to 2035. Both transportation and building electrification forecasts have increased significantly, narrowing the gap to our Pathway 2045 analysis.\nThis strong electrification load growth outlook is also consistent with the California Energy Commission's forecast based on the state's decarbonization policies, providing a source of external validation. Rapid expansion of electrification sharpens the continued need to make significant investments in SCE's infrastructure. Over the coming years, SCE will continue to invest in wildfire mitigation and increase its grid work to support California's leading role in building a carbon-free economy. With growth in electricity demand, this significant grid investment will be spread over a higher volume of sales, supporting affordability overall.\nSCE's system average rate is already the lowest among major California investor-owned utilities, and we expect it will be the lowest for the foreseeable future. All of this, wildfire risk reduction, cost recovery for historical wildfires, the clean electrification investment opportunity and, importantly, our confidence in the 2025 EPS target makes me very excited about our near-term steps and our long-term growth, so I am confident that investors will fully recognize our significant value creation. And with that, let me turn it over to Maria for the financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by highlighting that Edison International's core EPS of $4.63 for 2022 was in the upper end of our initial guidance range. In my comments today, I will discuss fourth quarter results, our 2023 EPS guidance and our 2023 financing plan. Starting with the fourth quarter of 2022, EIX reported core EPS of $1.15. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 10, SCE's fourth quarter earnings increased primarily due to GRC attrition year escalation.\nThis was partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher net interest expense. The latter was driven by higher interest rates associated with funding 2017 and 2018 wildfire claims payments. At EIX Parent and Other, there was a negative variance of $0.03, primarily due to higher holding company interest expense. I would now like to discuss SCE's capital and rate base forecasts, shown on Pages 11 and 12. These are largely consistent with last quarter's disclosures. I want to emphasize that SCE has significant capital expenditure opportunities driven by investments in the safety and reliability of the grid. We continue to project strong rate base growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025.\nThe forecast also incorporates SCE's current view of the requests to be made in the 2025 GRC and other applications. SCE files its 2025 GRC application and testimony in May, and we will update our forecast and extend them through 2028 before our second quarter earnings call. Turning to our earnings outlook. We are initiating 2023 core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85. I will cover the components of 2023 guidance in a moment. But first, I want to frame our year-over-year EPS growth. The primary driver is rate base growth, which we expect to be approximately 8.5% in 2023.\nHowever, you can see that our guidance range implies relatively flat to modest growth for the year. To help you bridge the difference, Page 13 lays out core EPS growth year-over-year. The primary reason for the difference is higher interest expense at both the parent and SCE. Refinancing of debt at the parent and debt for historical wildfire claims payments drive the increase. To put this in perspective, of the gap between 2023 rate base and EPS growth, about 75% can be attributed to SCE's wildfire settlement-related debt. While SCE is carrying this financing cost until they reach cost recovery resolution, I want to be very clear that the utility expects to seek full CPUC cost recovery of all eligible claims payments, including financing costs.\nPlease turn to Page 14 for 2023 guidance and key earnings drivers. The components of our EPS guidance start with rate base math, which we forecast is $5.68. Let's next discuss SCE's operational variances, which have a net contribution to guidance of $0.48 to $0.75 per share. The major contributors are shown on the right side of the page. SCE costs excluded from authorized are $0.71 with the biggest contributor being interest expense on debt for wildfire claims payments. For EIX Parent and Other, we expect a total expense of $0.87 to $0.90 per share. I would now like to provide the parent company's 2023 financing plan.\nI'll preface this by saying that regardless of the specific instruments we use, our financing plan is fully reflected in our EPS guidance. Turning to Page 15. We project total EIX parent financing needs of $1.4 billion. We expect that this will be financed with a combination of securities with $300 million to $400 million of equity content and parent debt for the remainder. As a reminder, we issued securities with equity content to support our investment-grade credit ratings, which we are firmly committed to maintaining. To achieve our desired level of equity content, we may use a combination of hybrid securities, internal programs, or our existing at-the-market program.\nPage 16 provides an update on the CPUC cost of capital mechanism. If the 12-month average of the Moody's Baa Utility Bond Index exceeds 5.37% at the end of September, the mechanism calls for increasing the ROE by half the difference between the average and 4.37%. Importantly, the mechanism also resets the authorized cost of debt and preferred equity. Through February 16, the measurement period average is around 5.8%. We will be monitoring this over the next 7 months, and as an aid for understanding the specifics of the mechanism, we have provided a spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website that you can download.\nLooking ahead, we are reiterating our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate guidance from 2021 through 2025, which translates to 2025 EPS of $5.50 to $5.90, laid out on Page 17. My management team and I are fully committed to delivering on this target. I will note that this EPS target incorporates assumptions to accommodate the higher interest rate environment, but does not include the upside potential associated with cost of capital mechanism, which adjusts ROE and updates the costs of debt and preferred. To provide you with the sensitivity, if the mechanism does trigger, that would increase the ROE by a minimum of 50 basis points, and each 50 basis points of ROE changes 2025 EPS by about $0.28. Further, our financial assumptions for 2025 do not factor in the potential recovery of historical wildfire costs, which could be substantial.\nLastly, I want to build on Pedro's earlier point about affordability and highlight yet another action SCE has taken to manage customer rates. Earlier this month, SCE reached a settlement agreement with TURN and Cal Advocates to move to a customer-funded wildfire self-insurance model. This builds on the customer-funded self-insurance that was previously authorized in the 2021 GRC. Under the revised structure, SCE will be able to reduce its revenue requirement by an annualized $160 million, further driving down SCE's system average rate, which is already the lowest among major California IOUs, and we expect it will be the lowest for the foreseeable future.\nTo conclude, EIX offers double-digit total return potential, consisting of our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate guidance and 4% dividend yield. SCE's rate base growth is the fundamental driver as the utility invests in the safety and reliability of the grid, which increases in importance each year as economy-wide electrification accelerates. That concludes my remarks, and I'll hand it back to Sam.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nTed, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. So everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions."

My name is Dexter, and I'll be your operator today.\n(Operator Instructions)\nToday's call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nThank you, Dexter, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team. Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation.\nTomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.\nThe presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Edison International\n\nThank you, Sam. Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.48 for the third quarter and $3.49 for the first 9 months of the year. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our 2022 core EPS guidance range to $4.48 to $4.68 from our prior range of $4.40 to $4.70. We are fully committed to delivering our long-term EPS growth rate target of 5% to 7% for 2025.\nIn my remarks, I will focus on 3 key messages. First, SCE's excellent progress reducing wildfire risk. Second, we have updated the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events reserve. Third, I'll talk about the increasing alignment between California's clean energy actions and SCE's vision to lead the transformation of the electric power industry.\nSCE is making excellent progress in executing its wildfire mitigation plan. As I mentioned before, when we look across all 17,000 circuit miles of distribution lines in SCE's high fire risk area or HFRA, over 7,000 miles are already underground.\nAnd the utilities grid hardening measures are focused on the remaining approximately 10,000 miles that were above ground. SCE is rapidly deploying covered conductor and is on pace to complete 4,300 miles or 43% of its overhead miles in HFRA by year-end.\nAs depicted on Page 3, SCE plans to continue hardening the grid through its next rate case cycle, which would result in about 8,400 overhead miles hardened. Additionally, SCE has continued to reduce the impact of PSPS. With the acceleration of grid hardening activities on frequently impacted PSPS circuits this year, SCE anticipates reducing PSPS outage duration by over 44 million customer minutes of interruption.\nThat's more than 17% compared to the last 2 years, assuming the same weather and fuel conditions. As analysts, investors, rating agencies and members of the CPUC have observed from visits to emergency operations center this year, SCE has made marked advancements in its wildfire mitigation and emergency preparedness capabilities.\nAdditionally, we continue to share extensive data on SCE wildfire mitigation efforts on the Investor Relations website. Turning to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. In the third quarter, SCE paid about $350 million towards settlement of claims.\nDriven by this significant new information obtained through the litigation process following the closing of the Woolsey Fire Statute of Limitations in May, and our thorough evaluation of such information, the utility increased the best estimate of total losses by $880 million to a total of $8.8 billion.\nAs summarized on Page 4, I would like to share with you some additional information and background on the reasons for this large estimate revision. (inaudible) is a long and challenging process and we really appreciate your patience as SCE works through it in a prudent manner, which will ultimately support the utility's strong cost recovery applications.\nWith the Statute of Limitations for Woolsey individual plaintiffs behind us, we now know the actual number of plaintiffs bringing claims in connection with that event. And we have obtained important additional information on the nature of the claims for many of these remaining plaintiffs though still not for all of them.\nTo give you more visibility into the process. We now have more information regarding the type of claim a plaintiff has. For example, whether a plaintiff has a claim for smoke and ash damage or damaged property or entire property loss or for a business.\nBased on now having a defined number of claimants and more clarity on the nature of the respective claims, the reserve was adjusted to reflect our experience to date settling similar types of claims, including higher-than-expected costs to settle several types of those claims.\nThe continued progress settling claims enables us to move further along in resolving these historical 2017 and 2018 events. I want to be clear that we still expect SCE to file the application for TKM cost recovery by late 2023 and to seek full CPUC cost recovery of claims payments, excluding, of course, amounts recoverable from insurance or FERC (inaudible) under the agreement with the Safety Enforcement Division.\nI will also note that our financial assumptions for 2025 and beyond do not factor in any potential upside from this cost recovery application. My final comments focus on California's clean energy actions and Edison International's vision to lead the electric utility industry through the clean energy transition.\nIn August, the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, approved the rule requiring 100% of new cars sold in California to the zero emission vehicles by 2035. The regulation codifies the light-duty vehicle goals set out in an executive order earlier this year.\nIn September, CARB voted to ban the sale of new gas furnaces and water heaters beginning in 2030. This built on the CPUC's unanimous decision a week earlier to eliminate subsidies for new natural gas hook-ups beginning July 2023.\nAt the federal level, the administration is proceeding with multiple implementation actions for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Just this week, the U.S. EPA announced the first $965 million tranche of funding for the electric school bus program authorized by the Infrastructure Bill with about $35 million supporting school districts in SCE's area.\nWe are pleased to see this state and federal support for electrification, which is also consistent with our vision laid out in our Pathway 2045 white paper. SCE is a leader in electrification with the country's largest suite of transportation electrification programs led by an investor-owned utility, which benefit SCE in a differentiated manner.\nElectric vehicle adoption continues to accelerate here in California. Over the last 3 months, EVs accounted for roughly 20% of new car sales in California. SCE service area has about 400,000 of the 3 million EVs in the country. EV charging accounts for over 2.5 million megawatt hours or about 3% of SCE's projected 2022 retail sales. However, by 2045, this could grow to about 50 million-megawatt hours.\nMeanwhile, we are awaiting CPUC review of SCE's $677 million building electrification application which will help catalyze this market in tandem with California's plans to include around $1 billion in state budgets over the next 5 years.\nWe are excited about working in partnership with state and federal governments and with other stakeholders including the communities we serve to advance policies that rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions. With that, Maria will provide her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon. In my comments today, I will highlight that we had strong third quarter results and have narrowed our 2022 EPS guidance range to $4.48 to $4.68. Before I move to that, there are 3 additional takeaways for today's call.\nFirst, we remain committed to delivering on our 5% to 7% growth target through 2025. Second, our near-term maturities are manageable. Finally, SCE's current operational excellence program, which we call Catalyst, is off to a strong start, and we have high expectations for the program.\nLet's move to third quarter results, as shown on Page 5. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.48 per share. Recall that in the third quarter 2021, SCE received its 2021 GRC final decision and recorded a $0.35 true-up. This results in an unfavorable year-over-year comparison for this quarter. I will highlight 2 additional key variances. SCE's earnings were driven by an increase in CPUC-related revenue in 2022 due to the GRC escalation mechanism and previously unrecognized return related to the customer service replatform project final decision.\nMoving to Page 6. SCE's capital forecast has been updated slightly, primarily to reflect the timing of the spending related to the utility-owned storage project. The project is now expected to be online before summer 2023 and, consequently, some of the capital spending has shifted to 2023. As shown on Page 7, our capital forecast continues to result in projected rate base growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. This forecast incorporates SCE's current view of the request to be made in the 2025 GRC and other applications.\nWith respect to 2022 guidance, as shown on Page 8, we are narrowing our 2022 core EPS guidance range to $4.48 to $4.68 from $4.40 to $4.70. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the rest of the year, we are confident we will deliver results within this narrow range. I would now like to provide a brief update on our 2022 financing plan as outlined on Page 9.\nWe continue to expect to refinance the last $300 million of parent debt maturing this year with new debt. Recall that we completed a $400 million refinancing in August. Combined, these will complete the refinancing of $700 million of parent debt. On the equity side, we expect that internal programs will generate about $100 million of our 2022 need of $300 million to $400 million of equity content.\nIn April, we entered into a $600 million term loan maturing in April 2023, which provides execution timing flexibility for the equity content we identified in our original guidance. If we defer into 2023, we will incorporate any remaining amount into the 2023 EIX financing plan.\nAll in all, we will share our 2023 financing plan on our Q4 earnings call. Turning to the current interest rate environment, I would like to frame the company's interest rate exposure that factors into our 2025 EPS guidance and address how we plan to mitigate the impact from higher interest rates.\nPage 10 shows Edison's debt maturities over the next 5 years. There are 3 categories to consider. The first category is the debt that funds 2017 and '18 wildfire and mudslide claims resolution. (inaudible) SCE plans to apply for full cost recovery of eligible losses.\nSCE's cost recovery application will also include the interest on the debt that funds the claims payments. None of this potential upside is built into our financial forecast. The second category is SCE operational debt. The interest rate exposure is minimal as we updated the estimated cost of debt and preferred in September as part of our 2023 cost of capital allocation.\nThe third category is EIX parent debt. We are currently forecasting the incremental cost of debt at approximately 6.1% (inaudible) rates go higher over the next several years, we have headwinds to manage. Across the organization, we are always looking for operational efficiencies underpinned by a continuous improvement mindset.\nOver multiple rate case cycles, the utility has a distinguished track record of implementing operational excellent initiatives focused on enterprise-wide efforts to improve performance and safety, reliability, affordability, customer experience and quality. This has also enabled SCE to have the lowest system average rate among California IOUs.\nIn the current program, Catalyst, the portfolio includes over 600 employee-driven ideas with capital efficiency and O&M benefits. These ideas and SCE's operations and major themes include work planning, procurement and technology as shown on Page 11. The expected benefits should progressively increase as we accelerate implementation through 2024, further benefiting affordability for SCE's customers.\nAdditionally, we evaluate one-off opportunities. For instance, we have been evaluating our real estate portfolio for efficiencies. Reducing our footprint and managing the utility costs will benefit customers in the longer term.\nWe have high expectations for the Catalyst program and the ability to deliver value for customers. We expect to identify additional opportunities in the core areas of safety, reliability, affordability and quality as part of a multiyear program. We look forward to sharing success stories from the front line as we go along.\nMoving to Page 12. We have provided you with our long-term EPS guidance rooted in the significant investment opportunities aligned with our objectives of decarbonization and electrification. In this regard, I will emphasize 2 key points. First, we have incorporated the current interest rate environment and updated other assumptions.\nSecond, we have identified tailwinds and headwinds that may drive variability around these ranges and provided sensitivities where applicable. As you can see from individual details on the page, we believe that the combination of drivers and strong execution will deliver the 5% to 7% growth.\nLet me highlight a few areas. One is operational variances, which include the Catalyst work that I've described among other items. Also, I would like to point out that embedded in our guidance is SCE's current ROE of 10.3%. In the 2023 proceeding, SCE has requested an ROE of 10.53%, which is strongly supported by SCE's analysis and the current interest rate environment.\nThe 2023 proceeding also includes resetting the benchmark for the cost of capital mechanism to about 4.4%. If the bond index rates exceed the 100 basis point deadband, the mechanism would trigger, which in turn would result in updating the cost of debt and adjusting the ROE starting with the following year.\nFor sensitivity analysis, we expect each 10 basis points of ROE changes EPS by about $0.05 in 2025. Additionally, the range around the parent expense we've shown you in the past also incorporates a range of equity content needs, up to $250 million per year on average, and the amount will vary with rate base growth.\nTo conclude, we are reiterating our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate guidance from 2021 through 2025. My management team and I are fully committed to delivering on this target. That concludes my remarks. Sam?\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nDexter, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up, so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions."

Pizarro\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Edison International\n\nWell, thanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $0.94 a year ago. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our 2022 core EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.70. I also want to emphasize that we remain absolutely fully confident and our long-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% for 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks. I would like to begin with an update on the tremendous progress that SCE has made in wildfire mitigation.\nIn preparing for this year's peak wildfire season, SCE has a higher level of confidence in its ability to mitigate wildfires associated with its equipment. During the quarter, SCE achieved a significant grid hardening milestone. It has now replaced over 3,500 circuit miles of bare wire with covered conductor in just over 3.5 years. SCE expects to have covered approximately 40% of its overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas or HFRA, by the end of 2022. In many locations throughout SCE's service area covered conductor is the primary grid hardening tool since it balances risk reduction, cost and timely execution. SCE plans to continue its current pace of installing about 1,200 miles per year of covered conductor for the next couple of years.\nI am pleased with the utilities execution of this program which has and will continue to substantially improve safety for customers. SCE has achieved the majority of wildfire risk reduction through covered conductor and other system hardening measures, vegetation management and equipment inspections. Public safety power shutoffs or PSPS, provide additional risk reduction that is critical during extreme weather and fuel conditions. SCE also continues to implement cutting-edge technologies to mitigate against high-impact wildfires.\nFor example, the utility is leveraging machine learning to improve the accuracy of wind speed forecast at around 500 SCE weather station locations, and this will help better predict which areas may reach or exceed PSPS thresholds. The state of California continues to allocate substantial funding in support of forest resiliency and fire suppression, including CAL FIRE crews and aerial resources. SCE is also supporting the readiness and response efforts of our local fire agencies. For the fourth consecutive year, SCE is providing aerial suppression resources to local fire agencies to help quickly extinguish wildfires when they do start.\nSCE is contributing $18 million to lease the Quick Reaction Force of water and retardant dropping helitankers to Orange, Los Angeles, and Ventura County fire agencies. The QRF’s most critical feature is that it can continue to hover-fill and make retardant drops at night, making it the world’s first fully nocturnal aerial task force. In addition, SCE’s wildfire camera network provides visibility to growing wildfires for fire agencies and the utility continues to explore adding artificial intelligence technology and new data sources that can detect and confirm new ignitions.\nBefore I leave this topic, I would like to remind investors that we are hosting an in-person meeting on August 18th at SCE’s Emergency Operations Center and Energy Education Center. Our leadership team, and I look forward to discussing ongoing wildfire mitigation activities and SCE’s opportunities in California’s clean energy transition. So folks, come on down.\nAll right. Last week, SCE received a final decision from the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety, approving its 2022 wildfire mitigation plan update. This is a prerequisite to submit the annual safety certification request which allows SCE to benefit from the presumption of prudency and the liability cap under AB 1054. This decision recognized the progress SCE has made in mitigating wildfire risk and increasing the overall maturity of its wildfire mitigation portfolio and strategies.\nTurning to wildfire-related settlements. We are pleased with SCE’s progress in further resolving 2017 and 2018 Wildfire and Mudslide Events claims. In the second quarter, SCE resolved approximately $400 million of claims. In total, the utility has resolved nearly 90% of its best estimate of expected losses and continues to make steady progress in resolving remaining claims. SCE is well on its way to reaching substantial resolution of claims in the TKM matter and remains on track to file the first application for cost recovery by late 2023. I would like to be really clear that SCE currently expects to seek full CPUC cost recovery of claims payments, excluding amounts recoverable from insurance or FERC, or foregone under the agreement with the Safety Enforcement Division. We will keep you updated on our progress on this front.\nShifting topics, I would like to briefly address a lawsuit brought by two former employees of Southern California, Edison. As some of you may be aware, a jury awarded substantial damages to the plaintiffs. We don’t believe that the jury’s decision was consistent with the facts and the law, and it certainly does not reflect who we are or what we stand for. Rather than engage in a protracted legal challenge, we reached a settlement in July for which we took a net after-tax charge of $16 million. Edison International and SCE did not admit liability or fault as part of the settlement.\nOkay, most of my comments so far covered a lot about wildfire risk mitigation, which is a core component in adapting to climate change. I also want to emphasize our continuing focus on sustainability, because this underlies our company’s strategy. We recently published our annual Sustainability Report, which details 2021 achievements. These are covered on pages 5 and 6. Let me highlight especially that SCE has the lowest system average rate among the large California IOUs and that's primarily due to more than a decade of committed focus on operational excellence and cost management.\nFurther, as you see on page 7, the total energy burden in 2021, that is, the total cost of electricity, natural gas, and gasoline relative to median household income for customers in SCE’s service area was below the median for customers in other states across the country. We see the potential for that to continue to decline with increasing levels of electrification; our Pathway 2045 analysis shows that the greater efficiency of electric motors and appliances will reduce customers’ total costs across all energy commodities by one-third by 2045.\nLet me conclude by saying that Edison International is a nationally recognized leader in the clean energy transition. In alignment with climate actions planned by the state of California, as we announced last year, our goal is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2045, and that will cover the power that SCE delivers to customers, as well as Edison International’s enterprise wide operations, including supply chain.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. Edison International reported core earnings of $0.94 per share for the second quarter. Core EPS at SCE increased year-over-year, primarily due to the adoption of the 2021 GRC final decision in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. At EIX Parent and Other, the core loss was $0.05 higher in the second quarter. This was primarily due to higher preferred dividends and unrealized losses on investments in the second quarter of 2022, compared to unrealized gains recognized in the same period last year. On Page 8, you can see SCE's key second quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side, and I'll highlight a few. Authorized revenue from the 2021 GRC was higher by $0.34 for 2 reasons. First, the escalation mechanism for 2022 contributed $0.18 for the variance.\nSecond, because SCE did not have a GRC final decision in the second quarter of last year, it was recording revenue at 2020 levels. This timing difference contributed $0.16 to year-over-year Q2 revenue growth. Other CTC revenue was $0.26 higher, primarily related to the approval of GRC track 3. With this approval, SCE recognized revenue for costs previously deferred to memo accounts. Because the costs were also recognized, there was no net earnings impact from this revenue growth. The remaining O&M variance for this quarter was primarily driven by the timing of wildfire mitigation activity expense recognition.\nMoving to page 9, SCE’s capital forecast is unchanged from last quarter, when we reflected the capital expenditures SCE requested in track 4 of its GRC. During the second quarter, SCE submitted its track 4 request, which covers funding for 2024, the third attrition year of SCE’s 2021 GRC. In addition to requesting a revenue increase driven by the GRC attrition mechanism and inflation, SCE proposed deploying another 1,200 miles of covered conductor, which would bring the utility to a total of about 6,500 miles installed by the end of 2024, or about two-thirds of its overhead distribution miles in high fire risk areas.\nAs shown on page 10, our capital forecast continues to result in projected rate base growth of 7 to 9% from 2021 to 2025. This forecast incorporates SCE’s current view of the requests to be made in the 2025 GRC, and other applications. We see strong potential for SCE to continue deploying capital and achieving 7 to 9% rate base growth through 2025. Before turning to guidance, I would like to share a couple of positive developments from the quarter. First, SCE recently completed its annual wildfire insurance negotiations for policies that run from July 2022 through June 2023.\nIn view of the measures SCE has implemented to reduce wildfire risk, the company’s insurance carriers have further reduced premiums this year. Second, during the quarter, both Moody’s and Fitch affirmed EIX and SCE’s credit ratings and raised their outlooks to positive from stable. Both of these positive outlook changes were driven by recognition of the utility’s significant progress addressing wildfire risk, combined with the constructive AB 1054 framework.\nTurning to guidance, pages 11 and 12 show our 2022 guidance and the key assumptions for modeling purposes. We are reaffirming our 2022 core EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.70. We are awaiting resolution of whether the cost of capital will remain unchanged for 2022, and after receiving a CPUC final decision, we will provide an update on guidance to incorporate any changes, and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nIn the 2023 cost of capital proceeding, the administrative law judge recently issued a scoping ruling with two positive components that I want to point out. First, the proceeding schedule calls for a proposed decision to be issued in mid-November, which could allow for a final decision to be made by year-end.\nSecond, consistent with SCE’s request and past proceedings, the schedule calls for updating the costs of debt and preferred in September, which will allow SCE to reflect more up-to-date interest rate forecasts. SCE has made a strong case for its requested ROE of 10.53% and we will incorporate the final decision in our 2023 earnings guidance, which we will introduce on our Q4 earnings call. At that time, we will also update you on our long-term EPS growth rate target. We remain confident in our ability to achieve EPS growth of 5 to 7% from 2021 to 2025, which results in a 2025 EPS range of $5.50 to $5.90.\nI would now like to provide a brief update on our 2022 financing plan, shown on page 13. Our overall plan remains consistent with what we shared with you previously. In April, the parent borrowed $600 million under a term loan agreement, which matures in 2023. This transaction provides flexibility for issuing the previously disclosed debt and equity content securities later this year or in 2023. We will continue to monitor market conditions to optimize our capital structure, which, as we have said in the past, may include issuance of preferred equity, or common equity through the use of internal and at-the-market programs. Our prior 3-year ATM program expired earlier this year and we plan to establish a replacement program in the coming weeks.\nLet me conclude by building on Pedro's earlier comments on sustainability. I will emphasize the strong alignment between the strategy and drivers of the EIX business and the clean energy transition that is underway. Since publishing the sustainable financing framework Last June, SCE has issued $2.1 billion of sustainability bonds under that framework, with strong demand from investors recognizing the environmental and social benefits related to projects funded by these bonds. Our large capital investment plan focused on the grid provides ample opportunity for continued issuance of securities under this framework, which is aligned with the company’s sustainability-oriented strategy and vision.\nThat concludes my remarks, so we can go to questions.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nMichelle, please open the call for questions.

My name is Dexter, and I will be your operator today. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.\nI would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nThank you, Dexter, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read this carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Edison International\n\nThank you, Sam. Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.07 compared to $0.79 a year ago. We are reiterating our 2022 core EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.70, and our longer-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025, resulting in core EPS of $5.50 to $5.90. Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks.\nOver the last year, I've been updating you on SCE's substantial reduction of wildfire risk. Relative to pre-2018 levels SCE estimates, it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfire by 65% to 70% and continued investments will further reduce this risk.\nWhen we look across all 17,000 circuit miles of distribution lines in SCE's high fire risk area, the utilities grid hardening measures are focused on the roughly 10,000 miles that are above ground with the other 7,000 already being underground. The cornerstone of SCE's grid hardening measures is the wildfire covered conductor program. A key benefit is how quickly it reduces wildfire risk.\nThrough the end of the first quarter, SCE has over 3,200 miles of covered conductor. This is nearly double what was covered at the same time last year. SCE continues to drive this program forward and expects to have covered 40% of its overhead distribution lines or 4,000 of its 10,000 miles in its high fire risk areas by year-end.\nThe utility continues to adapt and update its wildfire mitigation plan to build on successes and learnings from the field. Most importantly, SCE's WMP is immediately actionable and the execution results in real risk reduction today and each day that SCE hardens it's grid. In addition, SCE is preparing for this wildfire season by prioritizing its inspections and vegetation management programs.\nSCE focuses its annual inspections on equipment that makes up 97% of total wildfire risk in 2022 and plans to accelerate completion of the vast majority of these inspections before September 1. Today, 166 cameras provide visibility to about 90% of high fire risk areas. And (inaudible) installations in 2022 and beyond will increase coverage to nearly all of the utilities HFRA to enhance early fire detection. SCE is increasing installed weather stations by over 10% and using machine learning to further advance forecasting and target PSPS events more precisely. Taken together, all of these efforts give SCE confidence in its ability to mitigate wildfires associated with its equipment.\nTurning to wildfire-related settlements. SCE made substantial progress resolving 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events claims. In the first quarter, SCE resolved over $700 million of claims. Driven by this progress and given SCE's current assessment of claims, the utility revised the best estimate of total losses higher by $416 million to a total of $7.9 billion.\nI would like to share the 2 factors that contributed to this revision. First, during the quarter, there were a handful of exceptionally large claims that were settled based on new information that became available during settlement negotiations. Second, as the statute of limitations for the Woolsey Fire approaches, SCE saw a higher-than-expected increase in the number of plaintiffs making claims. SCE reviewed its estimate and determined it was appropriate to revise the best estimate, which includes new provisions for future potential exceptionally large claims. In total, the utility has resolved over 80% of its best estimate of expected losses and continues to make steady progress in resolving claims.\nI would like to be clear that SCE currently expects to seek full CPUC cost recovery of claims payments, excluding amounts recoverable from insurance or FERC or foregone under the agreement with the safety enforcement division. A related question we've heard from the investment community is when does SCE expect to make that filing? Well, based on the current pace of settlements, SCE anticipates filing its first application for cost recovery by late 2023. I strongly believe that SCE operated its system prudently and will make a solid case in its filing. The considerations SCE will take into account in deciding the timing of its filings are described on Page 4.\nAnother action I want to highlight is SCE's recent legal challenge to inverse condemnation in the Thomas and Koenigstein fire litigation. We have mentioned in past discussions that SCE will always seek opportunities to challenge the document of inverse condemnation. To that end, in April, the utility filed a notice of appeal with the California Court of Appeals challenging inverse condemnation. Cases like this generally take 1 to 2 years to reach a conclusion, and we will keep you apprised of any meaningful developments.\nOn the regulatory front, SCE recently filed its application for the 2023 CPUC cost of capital, requesting a return on equity of 10.53% while maintaining its authorized equity layer at 52%. As we have outlined since publishing the Pathway 2045 vision, economy-wide electrification is necessary to make California's policy goals. SCE will be a key enabler of the clean energy transition, and we'll invest significant amounts of capital in its infrastructure. We believe that SCE's requested ROE will support attracting this capital necessary to meet its obligations to provide safe, reliable and resilient service and enable the state's climate change adaptation and decarbonization goals. Separately, SCE is awaiting resolution of whether the cost of capital mechanism will operate for 2022. We have summarized SCE's outstanding cost of capital applications on Page 5.\nLet me conclude by saying that we strongly believe Edison International is the best investment vehicle to participate in California's clean energy transition. SCE's approach to wildfire mitigation has shown positive results over the last 3 wildfire seasons and the utility is expeditiously hardening the grid every day to the benefit of both our customers and our investors.\nAs an electric-only wires-focused utility, SCE's ongoing investment in the grid will enable an electric-led future by integrating clean resources while enhancing resilience and broader climate adaptation. Economy-wide electrification is the most affordable path to achieving California's climate goals.\nWith that, Maria will provide her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon. My comments today will cover first quarter 2022 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, SCE's cost of capital application and 2022 EPS guidance.\nEdison International reported core earnings of $1.07 per share for the first quarter, an increase of $0.28 per share from the same period last year. Core EPS increased year-over-year, primarily due to the adoption of the 2021 GRC final decision in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by interest expense from increased borrowings.\nOn Page 6, you can see SCE's key first quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I'll highlight a few. Authorized revenue from the 2021 GRC was higher by $0.35 for 2 reasons: first, the escalation mechanism for 2022 contributed $0.18 to the variance; second, because the SCE did not have a GRC final decision in the first quarter of last year, it was recording revenue at 2020 levels. This timing difference contributed $0.17 to year-over-year Q1 revenue growth.\nOther CPUC revenue was $0.51 higher, primarily related to the approval of GRC Track 2. With this approval, SCE recognized revenue for costs previously deferred to minimal accounts. Note that this revenue increase was fully offset primarily by the recognition of $0.46 of O&M resulting from the track 2 decision. At EIX Parent and Other, the core loss was $0.06 higher in the first quarter. This was primarily due to dividends on the preferred equity issued last year.\nNow let's move to SCE's capital expenditure and rate base forecast. Page 7 shows SCE's updated capital forecast to reflect its upcoming GRC Track 4 application, which will be filed on May 13. Track 4 covers funding for 2024, which is the third attrition year of SCE's 2021 GRC.\nIn addition to requesting a revenue increase driven by the GRC attrition mechanism and inflation, SCE will propose continued deployment of covered conductor beyond the over 5,000 miles expected to be installed by the end of 2023. I would like to reiterate Pedro's earlier comments on SCE's wildfire mitigation plan. It is immediately actionable and the execution of the work results in real risk reduction today and each day that SCE hardens its grid.\nAs shown on Page 8, our capital forecast continues to result in projected rate base growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. The forecast reflects SCE's current view of the request to be made in GRC track 4, the 2025 GRC and other applications. We continue to see strong potential for SCE to continue deploying capital and achieving 7% to 9% rate base growth through 2025.\nTurning to the guidance, Page 9 and 10 show our 2022 guidance and the key assumptions for modeling purposes. We are affirming our 2022 core EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.70. SCE is recording revenue based on its currently authorized cost of capital and will reflect the final decision in the 2022 cost of capital proceedings in the quarter in which is received.\nAs Pedro mentioned, we are awaiting resolution of whether the cost of capital mechanism will operate for 2022. After receiving a final decision from the CPUC, we will provide an update on guidance to incorporate any changes in the ROE and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nAlso embedded in our guidance is EIX's 2022 financing plan, which we disclosed last quarter and remains unchanged. The revision to the best estimate of total expected losses does not change our plan. Also, I'll remind you that the claims payments themselves are funded with debt issued by SCE.\nI'd like to provide some additional insight into 2 of SCE's recent applications to the CPUC. First, SCE filed a request to extend its CPUC capital structure labor with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. You may recall that the CPUC previously approved a waiver through the earlier of May 2022 or resolution of the 2017 and 2018 events. The waiver allows SCE to exclude certain charges in debt when calculating compliance with its 52% authorized CPUC equity ratio.\nSCE has requested an extension of the waiver period until the CPUC resolves the last of SCE's cost recovery applications for the 2017 and 2018 events. The current labor remains in place until the CPUC rules on the recently filed applications. This provides SCE with the flexibility to finance itself in a way that is efficient for customers and shareholders.\nSecond, in SCE's 2023 cost of capital application, we requested an ROE of 10.53%, consistent with its recently filed off-cycle application. This ROE is at the upper end of the reasonable range estimated by SCE's expert witness. We believe SCE made strong arguments justifying its request and remind you that in SCE's last cost of capital decision, the CPUC concluded SCE's ROE should be at the upper end of the range. Under SCE's proposed schedule, the proceeding would conclude with a final decision by the end of the year.\nTurning to Page 11. I want to reiterate our growth opportunities that drive strong core earnings growth from 2021 through 2025 and highlight EIX's potential to achieve double-digit total shareholder return during that period. A key component of our total return proposition is our common dividend, which currently yields approximately 4%. I'm proud of our track record of 18 consecutive years of dividend growth and look forward to building on that history.\nOur EPS growth of 5% to 7% is driven by SCE's significant capital expenditure opportunities, including investments in the safety and reliability of the grid. Sustainable rate base growth results from the investments necessary to reduce wildfire risk and investments to support infrastructure replacement and load growth.\nAffordability is also a key consideration, and I would like to emphasize that SCE has the lowest system average rate among California's large IOUs. This is in large part driven by our strong culture of excellent cost management that has been a cornerstone of the utility for more than a decade.\nThat concludes my remarks. Thank you.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nDexter, please open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions)"

My name is Missy, and I'll be your operator today. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nThank you, Missy, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are other members of the management team.\nI would like to mention that we are doing this call with our executives in different locations, so please bear with us if you experience any technical difficulties.\nMaterials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-K, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.\nDuring the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Pedro.\n\nPedro J. Pizarro\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Edison International\n\nWell, thank you, Sam. Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $4.59 for 2021, which exceeded the guidance range we provided on last quarter’s call and was higher than $4.52 we had a year ago. We are introducing our 2022 EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.70 and we are reiterating our high confidence in our longer-term EPS growth target of 5 to 7% through 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nIn my comments today, I want to address 3 key themes that underpin the double-digit total return potential for EIX shares. I want to start with the tremendous progress and results achieved by SCE in recent years in reducing wildfire risk, and what gives us increased confidence of further risk reduction. I will then highlight our clean energy transformation that is underway and the substantial capital investment opportunities over the next few years to support the state’s goals. Lastly, I will discuss our operational excellence culture that will enable us to deliver greater value for customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders. All these initiatives, combined with our dividend yield, present an attractive total shareholder return potential and that's before even factoring the increase in our price-to-earnings multiple that we believe is merited today by SCE’s wildfire risk reduction and ongoing utility and government wildfire mitigation efforts.\nI am extremely pleased to say that the 2021 fire season marks the third consecutive year without a catastrophic wildfire associated with SCE’s infrastructure. This is despite another severe wildfire season and intensifying drought conditions in the state. We believe this illustrates the cumulative effect of SCE’s and the state’s wildfire mitigation investments and practices over the last several years, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. During 2021, the utility continued its strong execution of its wildfire mitigation plan and in many cases exceeded program goals.\nIn its 2022 wildfire mitigation plan update, SCE reiterated that covered conductor is one of the most effective measures to reduce wildfire and PSPS risks in its service area. As shown on Page 4, several factors contribute to our confidence in the covered conductor program. Further SCE is evaluating the potential for additional enhanced mitigation, including undergrounding in certain areas based on unique factors. Reducing wildfire risk will remain a top priority for the company and this will require significant capital investment, including $2.2 billion over the next two years through the GRC track 1 period.\nOverall, SCE estimates that its mitigation work through December of last year has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfire by 65 to 70% relative to pre-2018 levels, and please note that this is an increase from the 55% to 65% we reported previously for mitigation work through June 2021. As shown on page 5, SCE expects to further reduce risk with continued grid hardening investments, including deploying an additional 1,100 miles of covered conductor this year. This encouraging risk reduction metric does not take into account significant improvements at the state and federal levels to date and in progress. The governor’s proposed budget continues the trend of increased wildfire suppression and prevention investment, with CAL FIRE’s headcount set to be 45% higher than just five years ago.\nIt also includes continued funding for aerial resources and the investments to date already have made CAL FIRE’s fleet of aircraft, more than 60 aircraft, the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. The state budget would also add $1.2 billion to the previously approved $1.5 billion Wildfire and Forest Resilience Strategy to support forest health and fire prevention. We were also pleased to see the Biden Administration’s multibillion dollar plan to bolster fire prevention across the West, as 57% of the forest lands in California are owned by the federal government. Protecting against the threat of extreme weather today lays the foundation for the increasingly reliable and resilient grid necessary for the clean energy transition. Through SCE one of the largest utilities in the country, Edison International is leading this transition through its thought leadership and SCE’s programs to accelerate economywide electrification.\nOn Slide 6, I would like to highlight that Edison International has one of the strongest electrification profiles in the industry. Starting with transportation electrification, SCE has the largest programs among U.S. investor-owned utilities, and California is on the leading edge of electric vehicle adoption. In fact, 1 in 7 EVs registered in the U.S. are in SCE’s service area. EV adoption will be critical to achieving California’s climate goals and we estimate this could add over 50 million megawatt hours of incremental electricity consumption by SCE’s customers by 2045.\nBuilding electrification is another critical opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it's the area of the California economy where the least amount of progress has been made to date. Last December, SCE proposed a $677 million program to jumpstart widespread adoption of electric heat pumps in buildings, and then last month, Governor Newsom’s budget proposed almost $1 billion to accelerate building decarbonization. The governor’s proposal is a welcome complement to SCE’s plan and is a meaningful addition to help meet California’s climate goals.\nAdditionally, energy storage will be an important part of an electric-led future to ensure reliability of the grid. As we highlighted previously, SCE is investing $1 billion to construct 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage. The CPUC has already approved this investment and the project is on track to be in service by August. These projects and programs all help to advance the vision set forth in SCE’s Pathway 2045 Analysis. Underpinning the need to electrify the economy is substantial continued investment in the grid through 2045. In late January, the California Independent System Operator released its first ever 20-year transmission outlook, which estimates over $30 billion of transmission investment is needed by 2040 to meet the state’s climate goals.\nWe see this as generally consistent with SCE’s Pathway 2045 work and that identified over $40 billion of transmission investment CAISO-wide. SCE estimates that CAISO’s outlook includes approximately $8 billion of transmission investments in our utility’s service area, which supports the potential for continued long-term rate base growth beyond 2025. The SCE team is going to be fully engaged in the CAISO processes that lie ahead d those processes will turn this conceptual plan into real projects, and they will be focused on bringing ideas to the CAISO table that maximize the value of existing transmission lines, upgrades and new projects that will all make the clean energy transition as affordable as possible for all California ISO customers.\nIn upcoming regulatory proceedings, including 2021 GRC track 4 and the 2025 GRC, SCE will provide greater visibility into the near-term investments that are needed to ensure we remain on-track to help achieve the state’s climate goals. To achieve our ambitious long-term goals, operational excellence is absolutely imperative and it's going to be a constant focus for our team. For over a decade now, SCE has proactively pursued cost-reduction efforts to manage affordability for its customers. This focus on cost management along with broader operational excellence improvement has allowed the utility to absorb some of the rising cost to serve customers, which in recent years has largely been by investments to reduce wildfire risk and strengthen the grid’s reliability. I want to highlight that SCE’s system average rate has grown less than local inflation over the last 20 years, and SCE’s average rate is the lowest among the large California's investor-owned utilities.\nLast year, SCE advanced its operational capabilities with new systems and new digital tools deployed across the company and these resulted in enhanced data quality, improved power line inspection and maintenance, and enriched abilities to gather and to act on customer feedback. To further our capabilities and focus on operational excellence, we launched an employee-led continuous improvement program late last year. Our employees have been wonderful and they enthusiastically provided thousands of ideas that we believe are going to have real, positive, measurable impact on safety, affordability, and on quality.\nWe expect the ideas that SCE will implement over the next two years will enable delivering greater value for our customers, for our investors, for employees, and for all of our other stakeholders. I'm looking forward to telling you more about the results of this program in the future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Maria for her financial report.\n\nMaria C. Rigatti\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Edison International\n\nThanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts, our 2022 guidance, and updates on other financial topics. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.16 per share for the fourth quarter. Full year 2021 core EPS was $4.59, which exceeded our guidance range. On Page 7, you can see SCE’s key fourth quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. Core EPS increased year-over-year primarily due to higher revenue from the 2021 GRC final decision and income tax benefits from the settlement of California tax audits, partially offset by higher O&M expenses and higher net financing costs. The increase in O&M is due to a variety of miscellaneous items.\nNet financing costs were higher primarily due to the debt issued throughout 2021 to finance the resolution of wildfire-related claims. At EIX Parent and Other the core loss per share was $0.07 higher than in fourth quarter 2020. This was primarily due to dividends on the preferred equity we issued at the parent in March and November of 2021. Now let’s move to SCE’s capital expenditure and rate base forecasts.\nAs shown on Page 8, we continue to see significant capital expenditure opportunities at SCE driven by investments in the safety and reliability of the grid. In 2022, we project the highest capital spending level in our history, which includes SCE’s $1 billion investment in utility-owned storage to support summer 2022 reliability. As shown on Page 9, our capital forecast results in projected rate base growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. We are confident in this range, which is driven by continued investment in wildfire mitigation, infrastructure replacement, and SCE’s programs to accelerate electrification.\nPage 10 provides an update on the 2022 cost of capital proceeding. The CPUC’s scoping memo separates the cost of capital mechanism into two issues: whether extraordinary circumstances warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism, and if so, how to set the cost of capital for 2022. SCE recently submitted its opening testimony, reiterating that extraordinary circumstances over the last couple of years warrant a departure from the mechanism and recommending that the 2022 cost of capital components should be left unchanged.\nOur earnings guidance is based on this position and in consideration of the wide range of potential outcomes in the proceeding. I will address this when I discuss our 2022 earnings guidance. Additionally, the CPUC ruled that this proceeding is limited to 2022 and directed the utilities to file their cost of capital requests for 2023 through 2025 at the regularly scheduled time, which is in April of this year.\nTurning to Page 11, SCE continues to make solid progress settling individual plaintiff claims across the 2017 and 2018 Wildfire and Mudslide Events. In total, the utility has resolved approximately 78% of the best estimate of total losses. At the appropriate time, SCE will seek CPUC recovery of eligible and prudently-incurred costs. As a reminder, SCE is funding claims payments with debt that is outside its ratemaking capital structure.\nTurning to guidance, Pages 12 and 13 show our 2022 guidance and the key assumptions for modeling purposes. We are initiating a 2022 EPS guidance range of $4.40 to $4.70. To address the components, let’s start with rate base EPS, which we forecast at $5.34. Given the status of SCE’s cost of capital proceeding, we are basing guidance on the current ROE of 10.3%. To help you better understand the sensitivity, a 10-basis point change in ROE results in a 4-cent change in EPS. After receiving a final decision from the CPUC, we will provide an update on guidance to incorporate any changes in the ROE and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nLet’s next discuss SCE operational variances, which add to rate base earnings. This is forecasted at a net contribution of 11 to 38 cents per share. This includes 10 cents related to the currently authorized costs of debt and preferred equity that will be addressed in the 2022 cost of capital proceeding. Consistent with our approach with ROE, the currently authorized costs of debt and preferred are reflected in guidance. As we expected, the remaining variances are not as large as we have seen in the past. Prior years benefitted from items that aren’t expected to recur going forward.\nFor EIX Parent and Other, we expect a total expense of 70 to 73 cents per share. The year-over-year increase is driven primarily by a full year of dividend expense from the $2 billion of preferred equity issued last year. Lastly, we have 32 cents per share of SCE costs excluded from authorized. The primary increase in this category is the interest expense on debt issued to fund wildfire claims payments. As we previously communicated, SCE will have a full year of interest on the debt issued during 2021 plus interest on debt issued throughout 2022 to fund additional settlements.\nI would now like to provide the parent company’s 2022 financing plan. Turning to page 14, we project total financing needs of $1.2 billion, including the $300 to $400 million of equity content we previously discussed. We continue to expect to issue securities with an annual average of up to $250 million of equity content from 2022 through 2025. In 2022, the amount is higher than average because of SCE’s $1 billion utility owned storage investment that was accelerated into this year. However, this does not increase the total expected over the period. Additionally, we expect to refinance the $700 million of maturing parent debt with new debt issuances.\nTurning to Page 15, we are confident in reiterating our 5% to 7% EPS CAGR from 2021 to 2025. This would result in 2025 earnings of approximately $5.50 to $5.90 per share. We have provided modeling considerations for 2025 EPS to give clarity behind our confidence in achieving this range. As you can see in the table on the right, we expect 2025 EPS to be driven by strong growth in SCE’s rate base earnings, with offsets from increases in financing costs at the parent and costs to fund wildfire claims payments. Our earnings growth is underpinned by the capital investment opportunities at SCE that will create a strong foundation for climate adaptation and the clean energy transition.\nThank you. That concludes my remarks.\n\nSam Ramraj\n\nVP of IR, Edison International\n\nMissy, please open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions)"

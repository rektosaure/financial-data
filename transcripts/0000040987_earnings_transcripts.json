Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Walsh Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTim Walsh\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Genuine Parts Company's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining us on the call today are Will Stengel, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition to this morning's press release, a supplemental slide presentation can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company website.\nToday's call is being webcast, and a replay will also be made available on the company's website after the call. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions, the responses to which will reflect management's views as of today, October 21, 2025. If we're unable to get to your questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.\nA reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. With that, I'll turn it over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2025 earnings call. As always, I want to start by thanking our over 63,000 global GPC teammates. Our people are at the heart of everything we do, and our team's dedication and commitment to serving our customers is the core of our success.\nTurning to our results for the third quarter. A few highlights include total GPC sales were $6.3 billion, an increase of approximately 5% versus the same period in the prior year with sequential improvement in comparable sales growth at both U.S. Automotive and Motion. Gross margin expansion of 60 basis points versus the same period last year, reflecting the ongoing benefits from our strategic pricing sourcing initiatives and acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA up 10% year-over-year with improvement in EBITDA margins in both our automotive and industrial segments for the quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98, an increase of 5% from the same period last year. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect the ongoing execution of our growth and productivity initiatives. Our end markets remain muted, most notably in Europe, but we're working around the world to earn business with existing new customers. Globally, customers remain cautious and looking for the best value as they make purchasing decisions.\nTariffs, trade uncertainties, elevated interest rates, a cautious consumer and other challenges, but the teams have adapted to working in dynamic environments and remain resilient and determined. We have also been proactively managing the business to offset an inflationary cost environment and will stay disciplined. As it relates to tariffs, we continue to leverage our strategic supplier partnerships and collaborative GPC global approach.\nAs we expected, the sales benefit from inflation was slightly more pronounced in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. In 2025, we've performed in line with our expectations for the last 3 quarters and are narrowing and updating our guidance range for the remainder of the year. Bert will share additional color on the impact of tariffs and financial considerations as we push to close the year. We'll remain agile and focused on what we can control.\nTurning to our results by business segment. During the third quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately 5% versus the same period in the prior year, with comparable sales up approximately 4%. Sales inflation during the third quarter was approximately 3%. We're encouraged by the sequential improvement in the third quarter sales performance and believe we're performing in excess of the market growth.\nDuring the quarter, industrial activities metrics like industrial production and PMI remained soft since the trade and tariff uncertainty started in March. We've seen PMI below 50 for the last 7 months although there's been some sequential improvement with the most recent reading slightly below 50.\nDespite the market conditions, we're bullish on the outlook for Motion as their size and scale, competitive positioning and customer value proposition or differentiators. We see emerging industrial opportunities develop like onshoring as trade policies shift and our motion team is taking advantage of those opportunities as they present themselves.\nLooking at the performance across our end markets, we saw growth in 7 of our 14 end markets, which is up from 5 in the second quarter with strength in iron and steel, food products and fabricated metals. We're also pleased with the traction with our data center initiative, which continues to build momentum. This growth was partially offset by softer demand in pulp and paper, lumber and wood and oil and gas.\nOur core MRO and maintenance business, which accounts for approximately 80% of Motion sales was up mid-single digits during the quarter with shared strength in both our small and medium-sized and corporate account businesses. In 2025, our corporate account customer renewal rate is 98%, and we've won over 30 new contract relationships year-to-date. The remaining 20% of Motion sales, which originates for more capital-intensive projects, was up slightly during the quarter as customers continue to selectively pursue larger projects.\nHowever, customer sentiment continues to improve, and our large dollar order backlog has increased sequentially throughout the year now up approximately 20% versus the start of the year. Switching to industrial profit. During the third quarter, segment EBITDA was approximately $285 million and 12.6% of sales representing a 30 basis point increase from the same period last year. The Motion team continues to operate with discipline as they both manage a sluggish demand environment and offset pressure from inflation in costs.\nMotion's organization and cost structure is set up for the eventual rebound in industrial demand, and we would expect to see good operating leverage once the market influx. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the third quarter increased approximately 5% with comparable sales growth up approximately 2%. During the quarter, the automotive segment saw inflation in pricing of approximately 2%. Global Automotive segment EBITDA in the third quarter was $335 million, which was 8.4% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year.\nThe improvement year-over-year reflects stronger top line growth as well as benefits from restructuring and cost actions to offset ongoing inflationary cost pressures from wages, health care, rent and freight. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in the U.S., total sales for the third quarter were up approximately 4% with comparable sales up approximately 2%. We saw quarterly sequential improvement in sales growth from both our company-owned and independently owned stores with comps for our company-owned stores up approximately 4% and independent purchases up approximately 1%.\nOur focus on operating better company-owned stores is a key priority and advancing very well. As an additional and important data point, when we look at the comparable sales performance of NAPA to the end customer, which includes our company-owned store sales as well as the sales out from the independent owned stores to the end customer. The total NAPA system delivered end customer sales growth of approximately 3%. This metric also sequentially improved from the second quarter, which was approximately 1%. We're also pleased with the sequential improvement in the buying behavior of our independent owners, but we'll remain diligent to ensure we're partnering with owners in a challenging market.\nWe do this with defined initiatives that help our owners manage their operations and be more successful. We believe the work we're doing to better partner with our independents is having a positive impact and this effort will remain a high priority for the team going forward. By customer type, comparable sales to our commercial customers were up low to mid-single digits while sales to our retail customers decreased low single digits.\nWe saw sequential improvement with Auto Care and major accounts, which were both up mid- to high single digits. Our priority is to earn more share of wallet with our auto care and major account customers, and the team is building solid momentum. Looking at our product categories, we've seen sequential improvement in both our nondiscretionary repair and maintenance and service categories, which were both up mid-single digits in the third quarter.\nIn these categories, which account for approximately 85% of our U.S. automotive business, we continue to see brake/fix demand fundamentals despite higher prices driven by tariffs. Discretionary categories were again flat driven by specific category initiatives in our tool and equipment offering. Customers are using discretion and looking for value, however, deferred maintenance will ultimately need to be addressed.\nAdditionally, we continue to strengthen our relative footprint in strategic priority markets acquiring over 85 locations from independent owners and competitors in the U.S. year-to-date. Turning to Canada. Total sales increased approximately 3% in local currency versus the same period last year, with comparable sales increasing approximately 2%. Both our automotive and heavy-duty businesses are performing well with heavy-duty outperforming in the quarter. The economic conditions in Canada have weakened through the course of the year, but our team continues to outperform the market.\nWe're pleased to share we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire Benson Auto Parts one of the largest independent aftermarket players in Canada, operating approximately 85 stores in Ontario and Quebec. This is an attractive strategic transaction that adds talent store footprint in priority markets and a diversified product offering to better serve our customers in Canada. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter and is subject to customary closing conditions.\nIn Europe, total sales were flat in local currency with comparable sales down approximately 2%, consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. These results were below our expectations. The team continues to navigate a soft market that has moderated further in the second half versus our expectation. The team is managing inflationary cost pressures with a fluid political landscape.\nDespite this, we believe we're performing in line with the market with strength driven by the NAPA brand and key account customer growth offset by generally cautious spending and deferred maintenance. Rounding out automotive, our team in Asia Pacific continues to post solid results and win market share. Our team delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in local currency driven by both organic initiatives and contributions from acquisitions.\nTotal sales increased approximately 10% with comparable sales growth of approximately 5%. Both trade and retail businesses put up strong numbers during the quarter with retail continuing a strong run of standout performance. Retail sales were up again high single digits in the quarter, and showing strength relative to the competition in all other local retail segments. Our in-flight initiatives are working well and the local team is energized to build on the strong momentum. It's also appropriate to formally comment on the recent press coverage associated with First brands.\nGenuine Parts Company has a commercial relationship with First brands, predominantly across our global automotive business. Our relationship represents approximately 3% of global automotive sales. We're coordinated as a global GPC team and engaged in ongoing discussions with first brands to partner as they navigate their situation. Service levels, product availability and brand quality currently remains strong and alternate sources of products are expected to be available if needed. There was no negative impact to our third quarter performance.\nBefore I close, I want to briefly touch on our operational and strategic review announced in September as part of our Board evolution and in-flight strategic planning process. We continue to make good progress on the internal work and are on track to provide an update in 2026 at an Investor Day as we previously disclosed. We're turning over all stones and asking hard questions as we analyze how to differentiate in an evolving landscape. This involves an assessment of both our operational plans and our business structure.\nWe're excited about the value creation potential of Genuine Parts Company and looking forward to providing an update next year. In closing, as we look at our performance year-to-date, our results have been in line with our expectations despite less favorable market conditions versus our expectations to start the year. We're focused on what we can control and working to finish 2025 strong.\nOur operating discipline and actions to proactively manage the business in an inflationary environment, have been appropriate and our strategic initiatives and investments are making a positive difference in our ability to better serve customers. The near and long-term fundamentals of our markets are attractive, and we're well positioned to build on our momentum. Thank you to our shareholders, customers, owners and supplier partners for your continued trust and support.\nI want to reaffirm my sincere gratitude to our GPC teammates for your tireless effort and commitment to serving our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call. Our third quarter results reflect continued discipline and strong execution while navigating weak market conditions, particularly in Europe, the tariff environment and a cautious customer. Against this backdrop, our third quarter performance was highlighted by mid-single-digit sales growth, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, twice the rate of our sales growth. EBITDA margin expansion in both segments and a return to earnings growth.\nIn July, we shared that we expected third quarter earnings to increase 5% to 10% and we finished the quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.98, up 5.3% to prior year due to stronger top line growth and our restructuring and cost actions, which are offsetting known headwinds from lower pension income and higher depreciation and interest expense.\nThose headwinds cumulatively totaled a $0.25 negative impact to earnings per share. As it relates to tariffs, our teams are continuing to manage the tariff environment, leveraging our capabilities and expertise through a dynamic landscape. For the third quarter, we experienced a low single-digit benefit to sales growth from tariffs and a low single-digit increase to cost of goods sold, in line with our expectations. The net impact of the tariffs on the quarter was a slight benefit to our results.\nTurning to our detailed results. My comments this morning around our third quarter performance and outlook will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the nonrecurring costs related to our global restructuring program. During the third quarter, these costs totaled $67 million of pretax adjustments or $49 million after tax. With that, let's get into the quarterly results.\nTotal GPC sales increased 4.9% in the third quarter, which included a 230 basis point improvement in comparable sales, a benefit from acquisitions of 180 basis points and a foreign currency tailwind of 70 basis points. We delivered sequential improvement in comparable sales growth at both U.S. Auto and Industrial, with industrial comparable sales growing approximately 4% year-over-year, despite PMI remaining in contractionary territory throughout the quarter.\nFor the quarter, our gross margin was 37.4%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. The improvement in our gross margin was primarily driven by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. As expected, the benefit to gross margin expansion from acquisitions in the quarter was more muted as we have now cycled the 1-year anniversary of both the MTech and Walker transactions.\nTurning to our costs. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales for the third quarter was 28.8%, flat versus the prior year and demonstrates continued improvement in the rate of deleverage across the business through the course of 2025. On an adjusted basis, SG&A grew year-over-year in absolute dollars by $88 million, driven by a few key factors. First, approximately $40 million in SG&A growth from acquisitions, however, our acquisitions continue to have a positive impact to net operating profit margin.\nSecond, approximately $45 million or 2.7% growth in core SG&A. The growth of our core SG&A continues to be primarily due to inflation-driven increases in salaries and wages and rent. The growth of our core SG&A was mitigated by a $36 million benefit in the quarter related to our restructuring and cost initiatives as they work to mitigate cost inflation.\nFor the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.4%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Both our automotive and industrial segments expanded EBITDA margins for the quarter as sales growth, gross margin expansion and the benefits of our restructuring program more than offset core SG&A inflation.\nTurning to our cash flows. For the first 9 months of 2025, we generated approximately $510 million in cash from operations and $160 million of free cash flow. Our year-to-date operating cash flow in 2025 has been impacted by a few key factors: lower year-over-year earnings of approximately $100 million, accelerated tax payments of $90 million and higher interest payments of $50 million.\nThe remaining year-over-year decrease is driven by working capital changes associated with the commercial activity that was occurring in the first half of 2024, in connection with inventory investments made at NAPA. This activity and the associated build of accounts payable and receipt of supplier incentives did not repeat in 2025, creating a tough year-over-year comparison.\nThis headwind was concentrated in the first half of the year and our cash generation accelerated in the third quarter. In 2025, we have invested approximately $350 million in CapEx as we continue to invest to modernize our supply chain and create a better customer experience with our investments in IT. Our investments in supply chain modernization with our new DCs and our international businesses, alongside enhancements to our search and catalog capabilities are driving enhanced productivity and returns.\nWe have also invested $182 million year-to-date in the form of strategic acquisitions, and we are excited about the continued expansion of our market-leading business in Canada with the Benson acquisition. We continue to make good progress on our long-term strategic investments to properly grow our business with discipline and a strong focus on returns from these investments.\nAnd finally, through the first 9 months of 2025, we've returned $421 million to our shareholders through our dividend. Now turning to our outlook. As we detailed in our press release this morning, we are updating our outlook for 2025. For the full year, we expect diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.80 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.50 to $7.75, narrowing our outlook from our previous range of $7.50 to $8. While we delivered third quarter results that were in line with our expectations, market conditions through the third quarter did not improve.\nThe narrowing of our guidance range is based on our expectation that current market conditions persist for the remainder of 2025 and remain relatively consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. With respect to the full year, our outlook for 2025 includes the expected year-over-year headwinds from a loss of pension income as well as higher depreciation and interest expense.\nCollectively, these headwinds produce approximately $1 of EPS headwind in 2025 when compared to 2024. Our outlook also assumes foreign currency rates at current levels. In addition, as we've previously communicated, our outlook for GAAP diluted earnings per share currently excludes the charge we now expect to record in the fourth quarter with the termination of our U.S. pension plan.\nThe onetime noncash charge that would be recognized at settlement will be equal to the accumulated actuarial losses recorded on our balance sheet, which we currently estimate to be in a range of $650 million to $750 million. There are multiple variables that impact the charge, which will be finalized on/or before December 31, 2025. As a reminder, our U.S. pension plan is overfunded and terminating the plan has been a long-term derisking strategy to further strengthen our balance sheet. We will share the final details when we report our fourth quarter earnings in February.\nLet me share a few additional considerations to frame our outlook. Our updated revenue guidance assumes total GPC sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for 2025, up from our previous outlook of 1% to 3%. We are raising our outlook given our year-to-date results and recent momentum. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following: total sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% for the Automotive segment and total sales growth of approximately 2% to 3% for the Industrial segment. These updates reflect our expectations for continued solid revenue growth in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to expand gross margin. However, the rate of our margin expansion will moderate as expected as we've moved past the anniversary of our acquisitions in the U.S. NAPA business. We expect SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter, building on the improvement we've experienced sequentially through 2025, driven by our ongoing cost and restructuring actions. For 2025, we expect to incur restructuring expenses in the range of $180 million to $210 million and an expected benefit of $110 million to $135 million.\nWhen fully annualized in 2026, we expect our 2024 and 2025 restructuring efforts and cost actions to deliver over $200 million of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver our targeted benefits. Our outlook also includes expected interest expense of approximately $160 million in 2025. Collectively, these factors lead to our expectations for continued earnings growth in the fourth quarter.\nAs we progress through the quarter, we will continue to watch the fluid tariff environment, customer sentiment, industrial demand activity and overall market conditions, particularly in Europe. Lastly, we expect to generate cash from operations in a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million, with the narrowing of our outlook range around earnings, we would anticipate being at the lower end of these ranges.\nIn closing, the external environment remains dynamic, marked by a fluid tariff landscape, heightened cost inflation, stagnant market conditions and a cautious customer. As we look to finish 2025 strong, our focus remains on operating with agility and discipline while consistently delivering excellent service to our customers around the world. We remain confident in the supportive underlying fundamentals of our businesses and the strategic investments supporting our long-term growth.\nThank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] operator. This call is being recorded on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Walsh, Vice President of Investor Relations.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. With that, I'll turn it over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2025 earnings call. As always, I want to start by thanking our over 63,000 global GPC teammates. Our teammates are at the heart of everything we do, and our team's relentless dedication and commitment to serving our customers is the core of our success.\nTurning to our results for the second quarter. A few highlights include total GPC sales of $6.2 billion, up 3.4% versus the same period in the prior year. Gross margin expansion of 110 basis points versus the same period last year, reflecting our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions and continued progress with our global cost initiatives, which are helping to manage our SG&A profile in an inflationary environment.\nOur results for the quarter reflect the execution of our strategic initiatives and cost actions partially offset by ongoing weakness in market conditions and persistent cost inflation. We're operating in an environment that has presented several challenges, including enacted tariffs in the U.S. and ongoing trade uncertainty along with high interest rates and a cautious end consumer.\nDespite this, we faced the challenges head on, made prudent changes and acted with purpose while continuing to progress our strategic priorities to enhance the business. Our diverse geographic mix, ongoing productivity and cost initiatives along with disciplined investments we're making across the business, allowed us to close out the first half of 2025 with performance in line with our expectations.\nA key theme in 2025 has been the tariffs announced by the U.S. administration. Tariffs did not have a significant impact on our financial results through the end of the second quarter but we expect to see an impact in the back half of the year if current tariffs remain in place. Bert will share more details about the scenarios we considered as we work to provide our latest forward outlook.\nThere's a significant amount of ongoing internal activity associated with managing through the tariffs. I'm proud of the way in which the global teams have rallied together to leverage our global relationships and our One GPC team approach to navigate the environment. We have a global cross-functional command center setup that meets multiple times a week to analyze and manage the changing data.\nImportantly, our focus in these times is to help support our customers. For example, I recently spent time in the field with Motion customers. We were with a customer showcasing a proprietary digital tariff calculator built by our technology teams that helps our customers understand their specific exposure to tariffs and the solutions we can offer to help them problem solve.\nThis level of transparency and support has been very well received. Our capabilities at scale, access to global resources and relationships with our strategic suppliers makes a difference for our customers in moments such as these. As we discussed during the April call, when we offered various guidance scenarios, we'll update you today with our latest perspective, including how tariffs might impact us through the balance of the year.\nOur industry demand remains driven by great fixed customer needs, which results in an ability to pass through prices and the competitive activity in our industries remains rational. The magnitude of where tariffs will ultimately land and how demand will be impacted remains fluid. That said, we remain cautiously optimistic on market improvement in the back half relative to last year but likely with a slower pacing versus when we first gave our outlook back in February, which requires us to update the outlook.\nDespite that, the tone of recent customer discussions has been generally positive, as many customers want to cautiously push forward despite the fluid environment. Customers are looking for value from their partners in this environment, and we're well positioned to help with leading product assortment and service solutions.\nAs we continue to operate in this dynamic environment, we'll stay focused on controlling what we can control, staying agile to serve our customers while focusing on the basics, investing with discipline and executing initiatives at pace to enhance our operations and drive long-term value for our stakeholders.\nTurning to our results by business segment. During the second quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an approximately 1% increase versus the same period in the prior year, with comparable sales essentially flat. The second quarter represented the first quarter of sales growth for the Industrial segment in the last 12 months.\nLooking at the performance across our end markets, we saw growth in 5 of our 14 end markets which is up from 3% in the first quarter. And with strength in pulp and paper, aggregate and cement and food products. This growth was offset by softer demand in markets with heavy exposure to global commodities like iron and steel, automotive and oil and gas.\nOur core MRO and maintenance business, which accounts for approximately 80% of Motion sales was up low single digits during the quarter with continued strength with our national account customers. The remaining 20% of Motion sales, which originates for more capital-intensive projects, including our value-added service offerings like fluid power and automation, was down low single digits during the quarter as customers continue to selectively defer orders.\nHowever, our current value-added solutions backlog has improved versus last year and has been showing positive momentum year-to-date. As it relates to other general market data, we were encouraged at the start of the year as industrial activity metrics like industrial production and PMI were trending in the right direction. Unfortunately, as the trade and tariff uncertainty picked up in March through the second quarter, we saw the PMI sentiment metric revert below 50 and stay there for the last 4 months.\nAs we've shared before, we remain bullish on the outlook for Motion once the industrial economy returns as history shows that the industrial economy experiences sustained periods of growth following a contraction cycle. Despite the sluggish market, new industrial opportunities continue to arise as trade policies evolve, including, for example, data centers, semiconductors, power generation and mining.\nWe're also pleased to see continued progress with returns from our digital investments as we work to create a seamless, embedded and personalized digital experience for our diverse customer base. E-commerce, which mostly represents our customer digital integrations as well as motion.com continues to deliver outsized growth driven by specific data and product enhancements that leverage GenAI. Today, e-commerce sales at Motion are 40% of sales, up over 10% versus the start of 2024.\nSwitching to industrial profit. During the second quarter, segment EBITDA was approximately $288 million and 12.8% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year. The Motion team continues to execute pricing and sourcing initiatives as well as proactively managing costs with impressive discipline in this low-growth environment.\nTurning to Global Automotive segment. Sales in the second quarter increased 5.0%, with comparable sales growth up approximately 0.5%. Global Automotive segment EBITDA in the second quarter was $338 million, which was 8.6% of sales, representing a 110 basis point decrease from the same period last year.\nOur second quarter results for the Global Automotive segment reflect inflationary pressures from higher costs in salaries and wages, rent and freight in each of our geographies. [ Over to ] our results by geography in our automotive business, we wanted to touch on an important leadership transition we announced during the quarter in our North America automotive business.\nOn behalf of the entire GPC team, we'd like to congratulate Randy Breaux on his well-deserved planned retirement. [ Randy ] has been a key leader at GPC for 14 years and played a vital role in growing and improving our industrial business before coming over to lead our U.S. automotive business in June of 2023 as part of an expanded role. We sincerely thank Randy for his outstanding contributions and leadership during his tenure at GPC.\nWith Randy's retirement, we also want to congratulate Alain Masse on his promotion from President of our Canadian Automotive business to the newly created role of President North America Automotive, effective August 1. Alain brings over 14 years of progressive leadership experience within GPC and a deep understanding of the automotive aftermarket and NAPA operating model. His proven leadership and success in driving performance combined with his relevant industry experience and established relationships will help build on the momentum in our North America automotive business.\nNow let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in the U.S., total sales for the second quarter were up 4% with comparable sales essentially flat. Comparable sales for our company-owned stores were up approximately 2%, and while independent purchases were down low single digits. Sentiment with independent owners is showing signs of improvement, but still reflects ongoing pressure many small businesses are feeling from high interest rates and an uncertain macro environment.\nSales out at both company-owned and independently owned stores improved sequentially versus the first quarter. By customer total sales to our commercial customers were up low single digits while sales to our retail customers decreased mid-single digits. Within commercial, all 4 of our customer segments were positive with notable strength and sequential improvement in AutoCare and major accounts.\nLooking at our product categories at a high level, we've generally seen consistent performance over the last 4 quarters with nondiscretionary repair categories being the strongest and up low to mid-single digits.\nMaintenance and service categories flat to slightly up in the second quarter. This quarter, discretionary categories were flat, improved from last quarter, driven by specific category initiatives in our tool and equipment offering.\nThe U.S. automotive team is actively managing tariffs. Our total purchases exposure to China is approximately 20% at U.S. Automotive, which we believe is in line with or slightly below our competitors at scale. Our proactive efforts to strategically diversify our supply chain following the pandemic has served us well. Today, we continue to have active engagement with suppliers but the number of inbound conversations to discuss tariffs has reduced versus April and May levels, and the magnitude of the cost increases has also moderated.\nOur scale and analytics positions us well versus smaller competitors to react to and negotiate with a global manufacturing base. In fact, we recently hosted a supplier conference in China, with all GPC automotive businesses to showcase the diversity and strength of our footprint.\nAdditionally, during the second quarter, we acquired 32 stores from independent owners and competitors in the U.S. These stores, along with the 44 stores acquired in the first quarter, strengthened our footprint in strategic priority markets. We continue to make great progress with the integration of the stores we acquired last year including the acquisitions of MPEC and Walker. In May, we hit the 1-year anniversary of the MPEC acquisition, and our integration and synergy capture are on track.\nWe've now onboarded 100% of the stores to our systems and are focused on driving growth and operational improvements. MPEC is fully rolled into our comparable sales figure beginning in May and Walker will fully roll into the comparable sales figure in August. Our progress with Walker is also on track operationally and financially.\nTurning to Canada. Total sales increased approximately 5% in local currency versus the same period last year, with comparable sales increasing approximately 4%. Both our automotive and heavy-duty businesses are performing well with heavy-duty outperforming in the quarter. In addition, several of our investments in Canada, including the new distribution center in Mississauga, and the micro market prioritization initiative are driving results ahead of our expectations. We've seen differentiated growth in the local market as a result of these targeted investments. Our Canada team is continuing to outperform the market despite an ongoing soft macro environment.\nIn Europe, total sales were flat in local currency with comparable sales down approximately 1%. The team in Europe is working aggressively to navigate a muted market, payroll and rent inflationary pressures and a fluid geopolitical backdrop. Despite this, the expansion of the NAPA brand and wins with key accounts continues to perform well and deliver performance in line or better than market.\nPriority areas of focus in Europe continue to be profitable growth, pricing and sourcing initiatives, cost reduction programs and the delivery of strategic projects.\nRounding out automotive, our team in Asia Pac continues to take market share and delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in local currency, driven by both organic initiatives and contributions from recent acquisitions. Total sales increased approximately 13% with comparable sales growth of approximately 5%.\nBoth our trade and retail businesses put up strong numbers during the quarter, with retail continuing a strong run of standout performance. Retail sales were again up high single digits in the quarter and showing strength relative to the competition in all other local retail segments. Our in-flight initiatives are working well and the local team is energized to build on the strong momentum.\nIn summary, our first half results were in line with our expectations despite a dynamic environment. As we start the second half of the year, we're focused on controlling what we can control while proactively navigating the external environment. We're cautiously hopeful given multiple green shoots of encouraging data points but are appropriately updating our near-term outlook given the uncertainty.\nIf we take a step back for a moment, we operate in 2 highly fragmented markets, attractive industries that are [ great fixed ] in nature. Our diversified geographic presence and balanced business portfolio provide meaningful differentiation. Our scale and strong global partnerships continue to offer advantages relative to many smaller competitors as we can offer customers differentiated solutions. The near and long-term fundamentals of our markets are attractive, and we remain intensely focused on executing our global strategic priorities to create shareholder value.\nIn closing, I want to thank our shareholders, customers and business partners for their trust and ongoing support. And importantly, I extend my appreciation again to our GPC teammates for your hard work and dedication to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call. Our second quarter performance was in line with our expectations as we offset continued weakness in market conditions and tariff uncertainty with execution of our strategic initiatives and cost actions. Our discussion of our second quarter performance and outlook will focus primarily on adjusted results which exclude the nonrecurring costs related to our global restructuring program and costs related to the acquisition of MPEC and Walker.\nDuring the second quarter, these costs totaled $46 million of pretax adjustments, or $37 million after tax. As expected, earnings were down in the second quarter as our profitability was negatively impacted by lower pension income and higher depreciation and interest expense which cumulatively totaled a $0.29 negative EPS impact.\nAs we shared in April, we expected these factors to drive second quarter earnings down by 15% to 20% and we finished the quarter with an adjusted EPS of $2.10, down 14% to prior year. Our results for the quarter include an immaterial benefit from the impacts of the newly enacted tariffs. I'll provide some additional comments around tariffs in connection with our outlook.\nNow let's turn to the details of the quarter, starting with sales. Total GPC sales increased 3.4% in the second quarter, which included a benefit from acquisitions of 260 basis points, a 20 basis point improvement in comparable sales and a foreign currency tailwind of 40 basis points.\nInflation and pricing was a little more than 1%, including the impact from tariffs. Notably, while PMI remained in contractionary territory throughout the quarter, Industrial segment sales increased approximately 1% year-over-year.\nOur gross margin was 37.7% in the second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. The improvement in our gross margin was driven by the ongoing execution of our sourcing and pricing initiatives, along with the continued benefit of acquisitions. Our 1-year anniversary of the MPEC acquisition occurred on May 1 and we will hit the 1-year anniversary of the Walker acquisition on August 1. As a result, we would expect the rate of gross margin expansion in the second half of 2025 to be below what we reported in the first half.\nOur adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales for the second quarter was 28.7%, up 150 basis points year-over-year with the rate of deleverage continuing to improve sequentially. On an adjusted basis, SG&A grew in absolute dollars by approximately $145 million, including nearly $85 million in impacts from acquisitions and foreign currency.\nThe SG&A impact of our M&A activity will diminish over time as we anniversary the remaining acquisitions and continue to realize the anticipated synergies from the integration of these businesses. Our core SG&A grew $60 million in the quarter or approximately 3.5% as we continue to manage the rate of growth in our core expenses. Within our core SG&A, the increase was primarily driven by salaries and wages associated with our annual merit adjustments for our teams, which generally occur on April 1 as well as higher year-over-year incentive compensation costs as our programs are reinstated to target levels.\nIn addition, increases to rent expense as renewals occur in higher rate environments and higher freight expenses as we improve service to our customers, drove core SG&A increases in the quarter. We continue to work to improve our long-term cost structure, aligning to market realities and ultimately getting to our expectation for leverage in SG&A. Our results for the quarter include the benefit of the actions we are taking associated with our restructuring activities.\nDuring the quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $45 million and realized approximately $33 million of cost savings or a benefit of $0.18 per share. Our global restructuring and cost actions are progressing well, and we remain on track to deliver our 2025 targets.\nFor the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.9%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. While gross margin improved in the quarter, profitability declined due to headwinds from inflation-driven cost increases in salaries and wages, rent and freight expenses as our inflation in SG&A continues to outpace the benefit of inflation in our sales by approximately 100 basis points.\nTurning to our cash flows. For the first 6 months of 2025, we generated approximately $170 million in cash from operations. The reduction in our operating cash flows year-over-year is partially driven by lower earnings in the first half of 2025 and accelerated tax payments versus 2024. The remaining decrease is driven by a tough comparison to the first half of 2024 in connection with the inventory investments we were making at NAPA a year ago, including the associated build of accounts payable. These did not repeat in 2025 as we return to more normal replenishment levels.\nAs you recall, in 2024, we were investing in inventory at NAPA following the termination of 2 key suppliers in late 2023, and an overall program to improve inventory availability. In 2025, we have invested approximately $250 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our supply chain and IT systems.\nIn addition, we have invested $112 million year-to-date in the form of strategic acquisitions. We continue to make good progress on our long-term strategic investments to profitably grow our business with discipline and a strong focus on returns from these investments. And finally, through the first 6 months of 2025, we have returned $277 million to our shareholders through our dividend.\nNow turning to our outlook. As we detailed in our press release this morning, we are revising our 2025 outlook to include the impact of tariffs in place as well as our updated view on market conditions for the second half of the year.\nFor the full year, we expect diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts to be in the range of $6.55 to $7.05 compared to our previous outlook of $6.95 to $7.45. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $7.50 to $8 a compared to the previous outlook range of $7.75 to $8.25.\nIn April, we shared views on potential downsides to our 2025 outlook with respect to the tariff environment, including our view around the timing of the resolution of the 90-day pause announced by the U.S. administration. As a reminder, with respect to the pause, our downside view was anchored on the premise that if the tariff situation was not resolved during the pause, market and customer demand in the quarter would be impacted and the momentum we needed to drive our expectations for a more robust second half would be negatively impacted.\nUnfortunately, that downside scenario played out as we outlined, and is the principal driver of our revised expectations for 2025. Our revised guidance for 2025 reflects moderated growth expectations for our auto and industrial businesses for the second half, lowering our growth rates in each business by approximately 100 basis points for the year.\nOur revised view on growth is further supported by current PMI readings, which began 2025 above 50 and now remain in contractionary territory below 50 as we begin the third quarter. In addition to moderating growth expectations, we've updated our guidance to include our estimate of the impacts of the current tariff environment. For the remainder of 2025, our revenue growth includes a low single-digit pricing benefit and our cost of goods sold includes a low single-digit cost increase.\nIn total, our assumptions related to tariffs produced a slight benefit to our expected results for the second half. However, did not offset the revisions we made to our market condition assumptions I just outlined.\nAs we evaluated the numerous implications of the tariffs on our business, we consider the following factors: impact to our revenue, including the pace and timing of [ potential ] same SKU price adjustments as well as overall market conditions and fluctuations in underlying demand for parts and services; increases in product costs as we continue to engage with our supplier partners; adjustments to our supply chains, including operational impacts with inventory availability and suitable substitutes; as well as higher freight costs associated with movement of goods; inflationary cost increases in SG&A as the tariffs have the potential to drive higher salaries, wages and rent; and interest in foreign currency rates.\nAs we await greater clarity on the tariff and trade environment, let me share with you 3 things that we'll be watching closely as we consider our expectations for the remainder of 2025.\nFirst, the breadth and magnitude of tariffs. As evidenced from the new cycle in July, this is still a very fluid environment. We have factored in the tariffs that are currently in place, but any significant changes to the breadth or magnitude could have a further impact on our outlook.\nSecond, any evidence of demand destruction. While we have not seen significant signs of demand destruction at this point, as tariffs continue to auger into the broader economy, we will be watching closely for any change in customer behavior.\nAnd finally, inflation and costs. Through the second quarter, we have not seen a material change in the levels of expected cost inflation. But as tariffs continue to impact the economy more broadly, we will continue to watch inflation in our costs.\nI'd like to make a few additional comments regarding our outlook, starting with the year-over-year headwinds. On Slide 11 of our earnings presentation, we've included an illustration of some key drivers impacting our 2025 outlook.\nRecall that our outlook includes an expected headwind from a loss of pension income as well as higher depreciation and interest expense. Collectively, these headwinds produce approximately $1 of EPS headwind in 2025 when compared to 2024. Our outlook assumes foreign currency rates at current levels. Our outlook excludes the previously announced onetime noncash charge we expect to record when our U.S. pension plan termination settles expected for late 2025 or early 2026.\nAnd finally, I would like to provide some color regarding our expectations for the third quarter. July sales trends are off to a solid start and we have not seen any notable changes in demand to begin the quarter. However, the cumulative effect of broad-based tariffs on demand remains a risk.\nFor the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings to be up in a range of 5% to 10% relative to prior year. With that, our revised guidance assumes total GPC sales growth in the range of 1% to 3% for 2025. Our outlook assumes that the market growth will be roughly flat and that the benefit from inflation will be approximately 2%.\nIt also assumes the benefit of M&A carryover and about 1 point of growth from our strategic initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by the 1 less day in the first quarter of 2025.\nOur assumptions for gross margin expansion and SG&A deleverage remain unchanged from our previous guidance. For 2025, we expect to incur restructuring expenses in the range of $180 million to $210 million, up $30 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook as we expand these activities in light of continued market weakness.\nThe additional actions provide a slight improvement to the expected benefits in 2025, up $10 million from the midpoint of our previous expectations and are included in our revised outlook. When fully annualized in 2026, we expect our 2024 and 2025 restructuring efforts and cost actions, including the new actions implemented for the second half of 2025 and to deliver over $200 million of cost savings.\nBy business segment, we are guiding to the following: 1.5% to 3.5% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth flat to slightly positive. We expect the Automotive segment EBITDA margin to be flat to slightly down from last year. And for the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 1% to 3% with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. We expect Global Industrial segment EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 20 to 40 basis points year-over-year.\nFinally, we now expect to generate cash from operations in a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million, down from our previous outlook. The reduction in our cash flow forecast for 2025 is a result of our revised earnings guidance for the year as well as the increase in onetime costs associated with our restructuring program which drives a further benefit in 2025 and 2026.\nIn closing, the external environment remains complex with the tariff landscape driving heightened uncertainty across many prisms. Our teams are doing a remarkable job working with our vendors and customers to navigate the tariff environment. We are confident our teams have the capabilities and resources they need to manage the business through these changes.\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and the strategic investments we are making to improve our position for the long term. Our near-term focus remains on operating with agility and discipline while we continue to serve our customers around the world. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, April 22, 2025.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Walsh, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTimothy Walsh\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Genuine Parts Company's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining us on the call today are Will Stengel, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn addition to this morning's press release, a supplemental slide presentation can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company website. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will also be made available on the company's website after the call. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions, the responses to which will reflect management's views as of today, April 22, 2025.

A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2025 earnings call. Before we get into the details of our results, I always want to start by thanking our over 63,000 GPC teammates around the globe. Your dedication and commitment to serving our customers remain the core of our success. I'm so proud of the team's continued focus and hard work.\nWe had a solid quarter in line with our expectations, but we're obviously working in a dynamic external environment. Tariffs, trade and geopolitics are impacting the operating landscape for all companies. These factors, combined with inflation and interest rates, are adding to an already cautious demand backdrop. Despite this, we remain focused on what we can control, providing excellent customer service and executing on our strategic initiatives to make the business smarter, faster and better. The teams have navigated multiple market environments over the past 5 years, and we've used those moments to drive positive change across our company and advance our strategic priorities. We're committed to this approach as we navigate the current environment and are confident that we have the relevant playbooks to remain agile.\nI experienced our focus on serving our customers firsthand last week at the NAPA National Ownership Workshop Event, where we celebrated NAPA's 100-year anniversary. The event highlighted NAPA's status as a global leader and pioneer of the automotive aftermarket industry. Joined by thousands of our repair shop customers, independent owners and field teammates, we reflected on this significant milestone and reinforced our commitment to delivering outstanding customer service together for the next 100 years. Not only was this event an opportunity to celebrate our history, it was also a chance to detail the in-flight work that's shaping our future. Our working session showcase details around talent and culture, sales effectiveness, operational excellence and technology initiatives, all designed to enhance our customer experience.\nAs an example, we highlighted the recent rollout of our modernized e-commerce platform, NAPA PROLink, built specifically for our commercial customers. Developed in partnership with Google, this platform features proprietary search capabilities that are faster and more reliable. The platform offers improved functionality with 10% more product coverage and leverages a more comprehensive and accurate catalog. In 2025, NAPA B2B e-sales are growing mid-single digits and capturing new business. The customer feedback on the modernized platform is overwhelmingly positive, and we're excited about the benefits this will deliver to the NAPA business and our customers as we move forward.\nNow turning to our business results. I'll walk you through highlights of our first quarter performance, which were in line with our expectations. Following my remarks, Bert will provide some additional color on our financial results and touch on our 2025 outlook, which we're maintaining today despite the evolving trade policies.\nA few highlights from the first quarter include total GPC sales of $5.9 billion, up 1.4% versus the same period in the prior year. Our sales growth was primarily driven by acquisitions and improving sales in our industrial business, which was partially offset by 1 less selling day impacting sales growth in the quarter by 110 basis points. Gross margin expansion of 120 basis points versus the same period last year, reflecting the benefits from acquisitions and our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives. And solid progress with our productivity initiatives to manage and optimize expenses.\nTurning to our results by business segment. During the first quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, approximately flat versus the same period in the prior year with comparable sales decreasing less than 1%. The 1 less selling day negatively impacted Global Industrial sales by 150 basis points. While we continue to navigate sluggish market conditions, we saw a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, driven by increased customer activity and merchants-defined sales initiatives. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were positive in all 3 months of the first quarter.\nLooking at the performance across our 14 end markets, we saw growth in pulp and paper, aggregate and cement and DC and logistics, while iron and steel, automotive and oil and gas remained pressured. During the quarter, 9 of our 14 end markets saw a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our performance by customer type saw continued outperformance with our national account customers. We also saw sequential improvement in our local MRO accounts and value-added services compared to 2024. Sales from value-added services, like automation solutions and fluid power were flat to slightly down, which represents a notable improvement relative to last year.\nSwitching to industrial profit. During the first quarter, segment EBITDA was approximately $279 million and 12.7% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year. Overall, the Motion team continues to make progress on its profitable growth, category management and supply chain productivity initiatives. The team is managing the business with discipline to deliver profitability despite a persistent soft market environment.\nWhile industrial activity metrics like PMI and industrial production have been depressed for the longest period in over 3 decades, we were encouraged to see PMI start the year with some momentum with 2 consecutive months above 50 before slipping back to 49 in March. Motion size and scale, diverse end markets and strong customer value proposition position us well in a highly fragmented industry and across all market environments.\nTurning to Global Automotive segment. Sales in the first quarter increased 2.5% with comparable sales decreasing 0.8%, in line with our expectations. The first quarter included 1 less selling day compared to last year, which negatively impacted sales and comparable sales growth by an estimated 90 basis points. Global Automotive segment EBITDA in the first quarter was $285 million, which was 7.8% of sales, representing a 110 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our first quarter results for the Global Automotive segment reflect ongoing pressure from softer organic sales in the U.S. and Europe and the 1 less selling day.\nNow let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in the U.S. Total sales for the first quarter were up approximately 4% while comparable sales declined approximately 3%. During the quarter, the 1 less selling day negatively impacted sales and comparable sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Looking at average daily sales across the business, sales in the quarter were positive in all 3 months, with March being the strongest. Comparable sales for our company-owned stores were up low single digits while independent purchases were down low single digits.\nBy customer type, total sales to our commercial customers were up low single digits with all four customer segments being positive in the quarter, while sales to our retail customers decreased mid-single digits. Our performance by category is consistent with the prior 2 quarters with nondiscretionary repair categories up low single digits and maintenance and service categories flat in the first quarter. The pressure remains in our discretionary categories, which represent approximately 15% of sales and were down mid-single digits.\nAdditionally, we acquired 44 stores from independent owners and competitors, further strengthening our footprint in our priority markets. The integration of our recent acquisitions, including MPEC and Walker acquired in mid-2024 are progressing well and remain on plan. Both acquisitions are positively contributing to NAPA's EBITDA margin.\nTurning to Canada. Total sales increased approximately 5% in local currency versus the same period last year with comparable sales increasing approximately 4%. These results are a testament to the exceptional work of our Canadian team who delivered strong results despite a softer macroeconomic environment. In Europe, total sales increased approximately 3% in local currency with comparable sales essentially flat. The team in Europe continues its expansion of the NAPA brand and its wins with key accounts. Underlying market demand remains soft across our geographies driven by macro challenges. Despite these headwinds, our ongoing strategic initiatives, including upgrades to our supply chain infrastructure, are expected to improve productivity efficiencies and support future profitable growth in our geographies.\nRounding out automotive, our team in Asia Pac delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in local currency driven by both organic initiatives and contributions from recent acquisitions. Total sales increased approximately 12% with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. Continued strength from our retail business is notable in the market. This sustained performance underscores the strength of our team in the region and their ability to execute effectively in the market.\nAs we look ahead to the second quarter and the rest of the year, we remain focused on what we can control. We believe our diversified global geographies and business mix creates differentiation as we leverage our global relationships to navigate the market. Our scale creates an advantage relative to many other small players in our industries. We've got a battle-tested team in place with required expertise to navigate uncertain markets. We've invested in the business over the recent past to provide tools to help us analyze the business with more granularity. We have a long-standing history of financial strength characterized by attractive cash generation. Importantly, we also have a team culture defined by an action bias, agility and a passion for serving customers in every market environment.\nI want to conclude by thanking our shareholders, customers and suppliers for their trust and continued support. Most of all, thanks again to our GPC teammates for your dedication and hard work.\nI'll now turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call.\nOur first quarter performance was in line with our expectations despite a dynamic external backdrop, which is a reflection of the resiliency and agility of our teams as we continue to navigate through challenging conditions. Our discussion today of our first quarter performance and our outlook will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the nonrecurring costs related to our global restructuring program and costs related to the acquisition of MPEC and Walker. During the first quarter, these costs totaled $69 million of pretax adjustments or $49 million after tax.\nAs expected, earnings were down in the first quarter as our profitability was negatively impacted by 1 less selling day, lower pension income, higher depreciation and interest expense and foreign currency headwinds, which cumulatively totaled a $0.48 negative impact. As we shared in February, we expected these factors to drive first quarter earnings down by 20% to 30%, and we finished the quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.75, down 21% to prior year. While certain new tariffs took effect during the quarter, the financial impact to GPC for Q1 was immaterial.\nLet's turn to the details of the quarter, starting with sales. Total GPC sales increased 1.4% in the first quarter, which included a benefit from acquisitions of 300 basis points. These items were partially offset by foreign currency headwinds and an 80 basis point decrease in comparable sales as our businesses continue to operate in soft market conditions. Both total sales and comp sales were negatively impacted by 110 basis points from 1 less selling day.\nOur gross margin was 37.1% in the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from last year, relatively in line with our expectations. The improvement in our gross margin was driven by acquisitions, along with some favorability in vendor rebates. Recall that we will begin to cycle these acquisitions through 2025 and, as a result, would expect the rate of gross margin expansion in subsequent quarters in 2025 to be below what we reported in the first quarter.\nOur adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales for the first quarter was 28.9%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, sequentially improving from the fourth quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, our SG&A grew in absolute dollars by $120 million year-over-year, including approximately $80 million from acquired businesses. The SG&A impact of acquired businesses will diminish over time as we anniversary the acquisitions and continue to realize the anticipated synergies from the integration of these businesses.\nOur core SG&A grew $40 million or 2.5% in the quarter as we curb the rate of growth of core SG&A significantly on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2024 when we experienced core SG&A growth of approximately 4%. We continue to do the hard work to improve our cost structure, aligning to market realities and ultimately getting to our expectation for leverage in SG&A. Within our core SG&A, we experienced an increase of approximately $45 million related to salaries and merit adjustments and rent expense due to lease renewals occurring in a higher rate environment.\nOver the past year, we've taken extensive actions to adjust our cost structure and our efforts remain in flight and on track. In the first quarter, we incurred restructuring costs of $55 million and realized approximately $27 million of cost savings or a benefit of $0.14 per share.\nFor the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.1%, down 80 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by the impact of 1 less selling day and deleverage from lower organic sales growth and cost inflation, partially offset by benefits from our acquisitions and restructuring efforts.\nTurning to our cash flows. For the quarter, cash from operations was down $41 million and free cash flow was down approximately $160 million. While we continue to benefit from favorable terms within payables, our investments in inventory, including our MPEC and Walker acquisitions, created timing headwinds in working capital in the first quarter, which is typically our lowest cash generation quarter of the year.\nDuring the first quarter, we invested approximately $120 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures as we continued our investment in our supply chain and IT systems. In addition, we invested approximately $75 million in the form of strategic acquisitions. And finally, during the quarter, we returned approximately $135 million to our shareholders through our dividend.\nNow turning to our outlook. As we detailed in our press release this morning, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2025. For the full year, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, to be in a range of $6.95 to $7.45 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.75 to $8.25. As further detailed in our earnings release, our outlook excludes the previously announced onetime noncash charge we expect to record when our U.S. pension plan termination settles, expected for late 2025 or early 2026.\nOn Slide 11 of our earnings presentation, we've included an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our 2025 outlook. Recall that our outlook includes an expected headwind from a loss of pension income, higher depreciation and interest expense as well as a headwind from foreign exchange conversion. Collectively, these headwinds produced approximately $1 of EPS headwind in 2025 when compared to 2024. Our current outlook assumes foreign currency rates at current levels.\nWhile we have reaffirmed our outlook for the full year, the fluid external backdrop makes visibility into the rest of the year, particularly in the second half, more complex. We believe we can meet our expectations for the year. However, it is important to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook given the lack of clarity in the current external landscape.\nFirst, consistent with February, our outlook does not include any impact from tariffs in 2025. The potential implications of the U.S. administration shifting policies on tariffs is unclear, and the tariffs could impact us across multiple prisms. As we evaluate the implications of the tariffs on our business, we will be considering the following factors: impact to our revenue, including the pace and timing of potential same SKU price adjustments; overall market conditions and fluctuations in underlying demand for parts and services; increases in product costs as we engage with our supplier partners; adjustments to our supply chains, including operational impacts with inventory availability and suitable substitutes as well as higher freight costs associated with movement of goods; inflationary cost increases in SG&A as the tariffs have the potential to drive higher salaries, wages and rent; and volatility in interest rates and foreign currency rates, which could have negative impacts.\nGiven the shifting environment, the recent 90-day pause to delay the effective date of the announced tariffs for many countries and the complexity of applying the tariffs I just outlined, we believe it is prudent to exclude any impact of potential tariffs from our outlook as we await greater clarity from the U.S. administration on the path forward.\nWhile we don't guide to the quarter, I would like to provide some additional color regarding expectations for the second quarter, where we believe we have the most visibility into our forecast given the recent delay in the effective date for the proposed tariffs on many countries. Our trends in April have held consistent with March. And while market conditions remain soft, we've seen no appreciable downturn over the past 2 weeks despite the tariff environment. With first quarter earnings falling in line with our expectations, we continue to expect first half earnings to be down 15% to 20% and second half earnings to be up 15% to 20%, consistent with the view we shared with you in February. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings to be down 15% to 20% from the prior year, primarily driven by lower pension income, higher depreciation and interest expense and the negative impact of foreign currency.\nAs we look more broadly beyond the tariffs, recall that our outlook for 2025 is based on softer market conditions improving as we move throughout the year with a pace and timing of the recovery in both of our segments, leading to a more robust second half growth environment. However, many companies have limited information at this point as to what the full year will bring, and we are modeling multiple scenarios, many of which are incomplete given the lack of data.\nDespite the lack of clarity, for context, we can see at least two downside scenarios, which I'd like to share with you. The first scenario would be that the next 90 days brings clarity around the tariff environment, but the current uncertainty produces a more prolonged softness and lack of recovery in trading conditions beyond our current expectations extending into the early stages of the second half of the year. In this case, we would expect to conclude 2025 in the lower end of our guidance range.\nIn the second downside scenario, the tariff environment could persist for an extended period beyond the next 90 days and well into the balance of 2025. And in this case, our assumptions around the second half recovery may not materialize, which would make our current guidance difficult to achieve. Given the incomplete nature of the second downside scenario, we are not able to reforecast the year, but we will pivot based on the backdrop and provide additional updates as needed.\nWith that, our current guidance assumes total sales growth in the range of 2% to 4% for 2025. Our outlook assumes that market growth will be roughly flat and that the benefit from inflation will be approximately 1%. It also assumes a benefit from M&A carryover and about 1 point of growth from our strategic initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by the 1 less selling day in the first quarter and about 1 point of headwind from foreign exchange. For gross margin, we continue to expect 40 to 60 basis points of full year gross margin expansion, driven by our continuous focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives as well as a benefit from the independent store acquisition in U.S. automotive.\nOur outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 40 basis points. Our SG&A outlook is driven by continued cost inflation pressures and the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the U.S. automotive business. These impacts are partially offset by the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities.\nFor 2025, we expect to incur restructuring expenses in the range of $150 million to $180 million associated with these activities with an expected benefit of $100 million to $125 million. When fully annualized in 2026, we expect our 2024 and 2025 restructuring efforts and cost actions will deliver approximately $200 million of cost savings.\nBy business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the flat to up 2% range. We expect the automotive segment EBITDA margin to be flat to up 10 basis points from last year. And for the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 2% to 4% with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. We expect Global Industrial segment EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 20 to 40 basis points year-over-year.\nTurning to a few other items of interest. We expect to generate cash from operations in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. The strength of our balance sheet continues to give us the confidence in our ability to execute in the face of the ongoing uncertainty of the external landscape. As detailed in our earnings release, our outlook for CapEx and M&A remain in line with the expectations we shared with you in February.\nIn closing, the external environment has become increasingly complex with the tariff landscape driving heightened uncertainty across many prisms. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and the strategic investments we are making to improve our position for the long term. Our near-term focus remains on operating with agility and discipline while we continue to serve our customers around the world.\nThank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Before we get into the details of our results, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our over 63,000 GPC teammates around the world. Your hard work, dedication and unwavering commitment to serving our customers are the foundation of our success. Our people are at the heart of everything we do, and we have a culture of service performance, integrity and teamwork.\nIn 2024, we made meaningful strides in strengthening our teams by making focused investments in talent across the globe at all levels. These people investments are helping build a stronger organization. As evidence of the strength of our culture, we're proud to share that in our most recent global engagement survey, a record 81% of our teammates reported being highly engaged with our company. Up 3 points from the investment priorities with an emphasis on talent, sales and supply chain.\nWe're confident that our investments and actions continue to strengthen the business and concern value. We complement our core investments with disciplined bolt-on acquisitions. In 2024, we acquired over 100 companies that added talent, geographic coverage, new capabilities and value to GPC. We I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some of our key accomplishments from 2024, and Bert will share more details on the fourth quarter and our 2025 outlook in a few moments.\nA few financial highlights for 2024 include Total GPC sales were $23.5 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million or 1.7% compared to 2023. Included in our sales growth was a benefit of 260 basis points from strategic acquisitions, which offset weak market conditions, particularly in our Industrial segment. Adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points, driven by acquisitions and our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives.\nWe generated strong cash flows with $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and we executed a global restructuring to proactively offset softer market conditions, which led to $45 million in cost savings in 2024 with more to be realized in 2025. In addition to our investment in the business, we returned over $700 million or nearly 60% of our operating cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nAs a sign of confidence in the long-term outlook for GPC this morning, our Board approved a 3% increase to our dividend, marking the 69th consecutive year we've increased the GPC dividend. Turning to our results by business segment. In 2024, total sales for Global Industrial were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 1.4% compared to last year with comparable sales down 2% as weak market conditions resulted in reduced customer demand for the full year.\nWithin Motion's business in 2024, our core MRO and maintenance business which accounts for approximately 80% of Motion's sales was essentially flat with the prior year. Our corporate account customers, which account for approximately 45% of Motion sales saw low single-digit growth. Looking at our diverse collection of industry served, we saw growth across 4 of our 14 end markets, with strength in pulp and paper, mining and DC and logistics.\nThis growth was offset by softer demand in markets like equipment and machinery, automotive and metals. The remaining 20% of Motion sales originates for more capital-intensive projects including our value-added service offering. This business was down mid- to high single digits for the year. While we've seen customers delay certain capital-intensive projects given the environment, we remain bullish on the long-term opportunities in this portion of the business as customer spending rebound.\nFor the full year, Global Industrial segment EBITDA was $1.1 billion, which was 12.6% of sales, a decrease of 20 basis points versus the prior year. While profitability continues to be impacted by sales deleverage and inflationary cost pressures, we're confident that our strategic initiatives and cost actions will drive margin expansion as market conditions improve.\nDespite the tough market in 2024, Motion North America improved gross margin and delivered EBITDA margin of approximately 13%, down only approximately 10 basis points versus prior year. Over the last 5 years, Motion has expanded its profit margin by over 300 basis points. While the industry faces temporary headwinds, we're energized about how Motion is positioned in the market and the opportunities available to us.\nWe operate in a large and highly fragmented market and despite being the #1 player in the industry, we still hold less than 10% market share, which reinforces the significant runway we have for continued profitable growth. During 2024, we executed a disciplined succession plan at Motion by promoting James [ Howe ] as President. James has a 35-year track record in the industry and started in the business as a motion field sales rep.\nThe Motion senior leadership team has 200 years of experience at Motion and 270 cumulative years of experience in the industry. Most importantly, we go to market with an unmatched team of local, highly technical accountant product specialists that know our customers' operations and the equipment they utilize as they create tailored solutions to keep their businesses running smoothly. Recall, in many instances, our motion associates are physically located in customers' facilities.\nMotion leaves the industry with its scale technical capabilities, value-added solutions and local support offering, complemented by our national network of both branches and distribution centers as well as unparalleled investment in inventory, we believe Motion offers the best value proposition regardless of customer size, type or location.\nIn 2024, we further expanded our depth of inventory by over 60,000 SKUs while simultaneously improving inventory efficiency. Our network enables the right inventory strategically located in the right markets to ensure we're at our customers' facility promptly to get them back up and running. In addition to the traditional MRO and maintenance solutions, Motion also serves its customers with a robust value-add service offering, where we help our customers improve their operations, drive productivity and create value.\nThis includes designing and delivering solutions such as fluid power systems, electrical and automation systems and conveyor systems to solve specific customer applications. Additionally, Motion offers its customers predictive and preventative maintenance solutions to help minimize the risk of an unexpected part failure. We've installed thousands of sensors into our customers' facilities that give them critical insights into the cycle times and the health of their operations.\nThese solutions are designed to improve throughput and productivity, helping our customers optimize their operations. Motion extends its competitive advantage with its repair and service offering including our new state-of-the-art facility in Houston. This team works hand-in-hand with customers to diagnose the root cause of machinery problems perform repairs and train their teams on proper installation and maintenance of equipment.\nKey end markets where we provide these services include mining, steel, cement and paper mills. In 2024, we realigned our value-add solutions team with our core distribution leadership to ensure a seamless and coordinated customer experience. This differentiated approach improves our ability to deliver our full motion offering to each customer. While industrial market conditions remain challenged, we're confident in Motion's ability to navigate the near-term headwinds and continue to drive value for our customers.\nOur leadership position, unmatched technical expertise and broad portfolio of scaled solutions position us well to capitalize on growth opportunities as industrial activity recovers. This, coupled with opportunities with advancing trends around nearshoring, have us excited about what's ahead for Motion. We're cautiously optimistic to see 3 months of sequential improvement in PMI with January at 50.9%.\nHowever, we believe it's prudent to be cautious with our enthusiasm until additional evidence of a sustained market recovery is clear. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Total sales in 2024 were $14.8 billion, an increase of approximately 4% compared to last year. Automotive sales growth was comprised of a benefit of 370 basis points from acquisitions, largely in the U.S. and flat comparable sales growth.\nThe moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continued to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, global automotive sales inflation remained below 1% throughout 2024. For the full year, Global Automotive segment EBITDA was $1.3 billion, which was 8.7% of sales, a decrease of 70 basis points versus 2023. Our results for global automotive reflect ongoing pressures from a soft market environment and cost pressures, particularly in Europe and the U.S.\nNow let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in the U.S., total sales were up approximately 3% in 2024 with roughly flat comparable sales growth. During the year, sales out to our commercial customers were flat while sales out to do-it-yourself customers were down low single digits. Within commercial, we saw low single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare and other wholesale customer segments, while fleet and government was flat.\nMajor account sales were down low single digits, but showed sequential improvement through the back half of the year. Looking at our comparable store sales, both sales out from company-owned stores and comparable sales into independent stores performed relatively in line with each other, approximately flat for the year. Turning to our product category performance for the year. We continue to see relative strength from our nondiscretionary repair categories, which accounts for approximately 50% of Napa's business, up low single digits in 2024. We General maintenance and service categories like braking, filters and chemicals, which represents approximately 35% of our business, were also up low single digits versus the prior year.\nAnd lastly, we continue to see softer demand in discretionary categories, which represent approximately 15% of the business, down mid-single digits from last year. While 2024 market growth proved to be softer than expected, we were encouraged by the progress we've made to improve Napa's capabilities, service and position in the market. Our back-to-basics mindset has driven material improvement in our internal metrics around inventory stocking levels, customer service and on-time delivery.\nAs an example, we're making notable progress improving the operations inside our current DCs, our internal metric for service levels from our DCs to stores improved almost 800 basis points in 2024, and our safety metrics improved by approximately 20%. And we did all of this while investing in inventory and flowing more product through our facilities to ensure we have the right part in the right place at the right time.\nWhile much of the focus at Napa in 2024 was ensuring we are executing the key aspects of the customer experience at a high level, we continue to make investments in the business to position us for long-term success. We're investing in the supply chain at Napa and completed the expansion of our Indianapolis distribution center, increasing capacity to support growing customer demand and improve delivery speed across key markets.\nThis facility includes a significant technology and automation upgrade, which will drive cost efficiencies and inventory productivity. In addition, in 2025, we're leveraging our global scale to launch a professional hand in service tool and equipment offering that will allow us to further capitalize on a large and growing industry opportunity.\nOur acquisition of MPAC and Walker are on track relative to operational plans and financial targets. In total, we've integrated approximately 55% of the stores into Napa technology platforms. which enables consistent control of local operations. In 2024, the transactions delivered sales, gross margin and operating profit margin benefit as expected. We've been pleased with the progress to date, and we'll continue to execute our post-close integration strategies.\nWhile the broader consumer continues to feel pressure from macro headwinds like high interest rates and persistent cost inflation, the automotive aftermarket industry fundamentals remain supportive of long-term growth. including increasing miles driven and aging car park and high new and used vehicle pricing. In addition, we view commercial customers as the growth engine of the industry as the complexity of vehicles continues to increase.\nWith this backdrop, Napa operates from a position of strength with 80% of our business concentrated in commercial, supported by our network of more than 6,000 store locations and approaching 20,000 auto care centers. In 2025, MAPR will celebrate 100 years of history, a truly remarkable accomplishment. We're thrilled to celebrate this milestone, but we're even more excited for what the next 100 years is going to bring.\nAs we look at our results outside the U.S. In Europe, throughout 2024, we navigated a weak economic backdrop, which resulted in a lack of market growth for the aftermarket. In 2024, total sales were up 6% in local currency, with flat comparable sales growth. These results reflect ongoing execution of our initiatives, including key account wins, expanding the NAPA brand and strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In 2024, we grew NAPA branded sales 16% versus 2023 to EUR 500 million, a remarkable accomplishment since its launch 5 years ago and a testament to the power of the Napa brand.\nThe rollout of Napa across Europe has been a competitive differentiator, especially in a challenging market and has far exceeded our expectations. Napa branded sales now represent approximately 15% of our sales in Europe and we can see a path of this penetration climbing to over 20% over the next 4 to 5 years. In our other international geographies, Asia Pacific and Canada, we continue to enjoy leading market positions despite challenging market conditions.\nIn Asia Pacific, sales in 2024 increased 6% in local currency with comparable sales growth of up approximately 4%. Our Asia Pacific team continues to execute at a high level delivering their fifth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. Their ability to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically and consistently invest for the future has been instrumental in their success.\nIn Canada, total sales in 2024 increased approximately 1% in local currency, with comparable sales growth down approximately 2%. Our Canadian team continues to execute well despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer. As I mentioned, our accomplishments and results around the world are bolstered by investment in technology and complemented by strategic acquisitions.\nAcquisitions have been a hallmark of GPC and 2024 was no different. During the year, we made progress on our initiative to own more of our NAPA stores here in the U.S., completing the acquisition of more than 500 stores, mostly from our independent owners. Our store footprint in the U.S. is now approximately 35% company-owned with the balance being our independently owned stores.\nOver time, we see a path to bring our network closer to a 50-50 mix. With our independent owners always continuing to play a critical role in our network, particularly in smaller and more rural markets. In addition, Motion acquired 4 bolt-on acquisitions in 2024 to build upon its technical and value-added solutions capabilities, and we've remained active to start 2025.\nGoing forward, we believe M&A will continue to play an important part of our growth profile in both our automotive and industrial business. We play in 2 large and fragmented markets and enjoy the flexibility of a strong balance sheet. Beyond M&A, our global investments in technology are advancing well. This year, we're focused on improving catalog and search capabilities using Google Cloud. Enabling us to deliver a more seamless experience, particularly for our commercial customers.\nAs examples, within our automotive catalog, we've made material enhancements that help our commercial customers find what they need leading to lower order cancellations and returns. And we're now leveraging machine learning and automation to help our catalog continuously improve itself without the need for manual data entry.\nWithin search, we used Google Cloud to build an automotive specific search experience, focused on our commercial customers. Our search results are now 4x faster, 2x more accurate all at half the cost. There are numerous other examples of progress within recent technology investments where we've leveraged our global scale to make us smarter, faster, better.\nFor example, the recent completion of our global HR rollout with Workday to create a standardized company-wide platform that simplified 40 disparate HR platforms to one. In addition, we've ramped up our capabilities at our Poland Tech Center now comprised of nearly 300 engineers that lead global technology initiatives across pricing, inventory, catalog, search and cybersecurity. Not only has the tech center added capabilities and speed but also resulted in material cost savings.\nLess visible, but critically important, we've made material progress to simplify our core tech infrastructure as we've improved stability, performance and scalability. Looking ahead into 2025, we have opportunities to build on our momentum and drive organic growth by enhancing our customer value proposition, expanding market share and improving profitability through cost discipline.\nWhile we expect soft market conditions to persist into the first half of 2025, we anticipate gradual improvement as the year progresses. A key aspect of our outlook is the improvement in market conditions for both industrial and a rebound in the European landscape. Bert will walk you through the details of our assumptions in a few minutes.\nOur continued investments in strategic initiatives reflect our commitment to driving growth and improving efficiency. We're confident these actions will support sustainable growth and long-term value creation. While committed to our long-term strategic investments, we're also balancing the current environment with prudent and urgent cost actions. Our global restructuring efforts announced last year have progressed ahead of plan, delivering cost savings at the high end of expectations.\nToday, we announced that we're targeting an additional $100 million to $125 million of savings in 2025. These efforts continue our focus to simplify our operations and improve productivity. Collectively, our actions across 2024 and 2025 will position us for approximately $200 million in annualized cost savings beginning in 2026. In summary, while our full year financial results were impacted by challenging market conditions, we're encouraged by the operational progress we've made across our business.\nGPC's legacy of operational excellence, exceptional customer service and financial discipline continue to guide us. Our market-leading automotive and industrial businesses are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities, driven by supportive long-term industry fundamentals while leveraging our size, global scale and expertise as a competitive advantage. We remain focused on creating value through a balanced capital allocation strategy, including reinvesting in our business, pursuing disciplined and accretive M&A and returning capital to shareholders through our long-standing dividend.\nIn closing, I want to thank our GPC teammates for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and to our shareholders for their continued trust and support. We look forward to building on our momentum in 2025 and well beyond. And now I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call. My remarks this morning will focus on 2 key areas: our fourth quarter performance, which was at the high end of our expectations and our outlook for 2025. Our fourth quarter results reflect revenue growth from the benefits of acquired businesses, which more than offset the negative impact of weak market conditions.\nAs expected, despite the revenue growth and gross margin expansion we realized, earnings were down in the fourth quarter due to headwinds from planned investments in the business and cost inflation, although further cost actions and better results from our global restructuring allowed us to finish 2024 modestly ahead of our expectations when we began the quarter.\nOur discussion will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the nonrecurring costs related to our global restructuring program, costs related to the acquisition of MPAC and Walker and a charge to write down inventory related to a global rebranding and relaunch of a key product category. During the fourth quarter, these costs totaled $125 million of pretax adjustments, or $91 million after tax, with $62 million attributable to the inventory write-down.\nStarting with sales. Total GPC sales increased 3.3% in the fourth quarter, including a benefit from acquisitions of 320 basis points and the benefit of an additional selling day in the U.S. totaling 110 basis points. These items were partially offset by slightly negative comparable sales growth as weak market conditions and lower customer demand, particularly in Industrial and Europe impacted our sales performance.\nLooking at the quarterly sales by business unit. Starting with our Global Industrial segment, sales in the fourth quarter decreased approximately 1% compared to prior year, with comparable sales down 2%. During the quarter, we had 1 extra selling day compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which positively impacted sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. Average daily sales were down low single digits in October and November and down mid-single digits in December.\nAs expected, our December results were impacted by the timing of the holiday and extended customer idling during the last 2 weeks of the year given the weaker demand environment. As we look at Global Automotive, total sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 6% compared to the prior year with comparable sales up slightly. In addition to the benefits from acquired businesses, during the fourth quarter, we had one extra selling day in the U.S., which positively impacted global automotive sales growth by approximately 90 basis points.\nBy geography, starting in the U.S., total sales were up approximately 7% in the fourth quarter, aided by acquisitions with comparable sales flat. The extra day versus prior year positively impacted sales growth by approximately 170 basis points. Our average daily sales cadence through the quarter was positive in all 3 months.\nAnd within our DIY and DIFM customer segments, the trends in the fourth quarter were generally consistent with the full year commentary that Will shared. In our international markets, Sales in Europe during the fourth quarter increased 3% in local currency with comparable sales down 1% as a result of weak macroeconomic conditions.\nIn Asia Pacific, sales in the fourth quarter increased 14% in local currency, with comparable sales up approximately 6%. Both commercial and retail segments delivered solid growth with notable strength in retail. And finally, in Canada, total sales in the fourth quarter increased 1% in local currency, with comparable sales down approximately 1%, driven by challenging economic conditions. As we turn back to our consolidated results with respect to gross margin, after adjusting for the $62 million charge to write down inventory related to our global product rebranding, our adjusted gross margin was 36.9% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from last year.\nAs expected, the improvement in gross margin was driven by acquisitions, primarily at U.S. automotive. Our adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter was 29.4% up 210 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. This deleverage can be attributed to the following factors. First, approximately 80 basis points from cost inflation, primarily in salaries and wages as well as rent and freight expense.\nSecond, approximately 60 basis points from acquired businesses, which represents the isolated impact of the SG&A of these acquisitions. When taken together with the improved gross margin, the net operating profit benefit from acquisitions to GPC is positive. Further, as we capture the synergies we expect from these acquisitions, the SG&A impact will abate over time. Third, we experienced approximately 60 basis points of deleverage related to a reserve adjustment for product liability claims.\nThis deleverage was partially offset by approximately 35 basis points related to our global restructuring efforts. Notably, the 60 basis point impact from the adjustment to our product liability reserve masked the sequential improvement in the deleverage in SG&A. As our cost actions and discipline in spending are having the intended effect of curbing the rate of increase. For the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.5% and down 180 basis points year-over-year.\nThe decrease was primarily driven by the continued lower sales growth environment and higher cost inflation in wages, rent and freight. Partially offset by margin expansion driven by our acquisitions and a benefit from our restructuring efforts. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 was 8.5% down 80 basis points from 2023. Our fourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes nonrecurring expenses of $91 million after tax or $0.65 per diluted share was $224 million or $1.61 per diluted share.\nOur full year adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $8.16 per diluted share. In 2024, we took actions to better align our costs with the current environment and made significant progress on our global restructuring. We incurred restructuring costs of $220 million and through our team's hard work we realized approximately $45 million of cost savings in 2024 or a benefit of $0.24 per share. Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations and $684 million in free cash flow.\nIn 2024, we invested approximately $570 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures as we continued investment in our supply chain and IT systems. In addition, we invested $1.1 billion in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our 2 largest Napa independent owners, MPC and Walker. Now let's turn to our outlook for 2025.\nWe expect diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts to be in the range of $6.95 and to $7.45, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.75 to $8.25. Our 2025 outlook does not assume any changes in tariffs from the new administration and assumes current FX rates. Our outlook for 2025 has been developed based on current weak market conditions and lower customer demand levels as well as our expectations around the pace and timing of an improvement in market conditions.\nWhile the industries where we compete continue to enjoy supportive fundamentals, the near-term market conditions remain muted as our customers navigate cost inflation, high interest rates a dynamic foreign currency market and the emerging potential for impacts from tariffs. In addition, as further detailed in our earnings release, our 2025 outlook excludes the previously announced onetime noncash charge, we expect to record when our U.S. pension plan termination settles expected for late 2025 or early 2026. And which we intend to treat as a non-GAAP adjustment.\nWe've excluded the impact of this charge from our 2025 guidance given the uncertainty of when the planned termination will settle which is dependent upon several regulatory steps and approvals. We will provide additional updates regarding the expected timing of completing the pension plan termination as we move through 2025.\nOn slide 12 of our earnings presentation, we've included an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our 2025 outlook. Let me take a moment and walk through the details of these components which collectively produce approximately $1 of EPS headwind in 2025 when compared to 2024. First, as I just mentioned, we have begun the process to transition our U.S. pension plan to a third-party insurance company, which we expect to complete in late 2025 or early 2026.\nIn 2024, we recognized approximately $67 million of income from our U.S. pension plan. In connection with the transition, the plan's assets have been reallocated and as such, our pension income in 2025 will be significantly lower with an impact of an estimated $0.28 per share when compared to 2024. Second, through the fourth quarter, we have seen notable moves in the foreign currency markets, which have put downward pressure on the euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.\nThe strengthening of the U.S. dollar on a relative basis against these currencies is expected to have a negative impact of $0.15 per share year-over-year. Finally, our planned investments in the business will result in higher depreciation and interest expense. On a year-over-year basis, we expect these 2 items will negatively impact 2025 earnings per share by approximately $0.60.\nWhile we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to share our views on the earnings cadence for 2025 and our expectations for the first half. Our sales outlook for 2025 is predicated on a steady improvement through the course of the year with weak market growth continuing into the first half of 2025 before improving in the second half. The pace and timing of the recovery of activity in both segments is a key element of our outlook. Given our views on the sales backdrop for 2025 within the EPS guidance range we provided for the year, we expect earnings to be down in the first and second quarters, rebounding with earnings growth in the third and fourth quarters, with results improving sequentially across each quarter.\nBased on our current expectations, we would expect first half earnings to be down 15% to 20% and second half earnings to be up 15% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect earnings to be down in the range of 20% to 30% from prior year, driven by several factors: 1 less selling day, lower pension income, higher depreciation and interest expense, the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and a weaker industrial market when compared to the first quarter of 2024.\nFor the second quarter, we expect earnings to be down and pressured by the negative impact of depreciation, foreign currency and interest as well as lower pension income. As we look to the specific elements of our outlook, we expect total sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. Our outlook assumes that market growth will be roughly flat and that the benefit from inflation will be approximately 1%. It also assumes the benefit from M&A carryover and about 1 point of growth from our strategic initiatives.\nThese benefits are partially offset by the 1 less day in the first quarter and about 1 point of headwind from foreign exchange. For gross margin, we expect 40 to 60 basis points of full year gross margin expansion, driven by our continuous focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives as well as a benefit from the independent store acquisitions in U.S. Automotive. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 40 basis points.\nOur SG&A outlook is driven by continued cost inflation pressures and the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the U.S. Automotive business. These impacts are partially offset by the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For 2025, we are expanding upon our restructuring initiatives and taking further cost actions.\nWe expect to incur additional restructuring expenses in 2025 in the range of $150 million to $180 million associated with these activities with an expected benefit of $100 million to $125 million. When fully annualized in 2026, we expect our 2024 and 2025 restructuring efforts and cost actions to deliver approximately $200 million in cost savings. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the flat to up 2% range.\nThe expectation for automotive segment EBITDA margin is to be flat to up 10 basis points from last year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 2% to 4% with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. We expect Global Industrial segment EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 20 to 40 basis points year-over-year. Turning to a few other items of interest. We expect to generate cash flow from operations in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion.\nFor CapEx, we expect approximately $400 million to $450 million or approximately 2% of revenue in 2025 at the high end of the range, moderated from 2024 as we drive further rigor and prioritization into capital allocation in light of the market conditions. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we will continue to remain disciplined in pursuing opportunities that create value.\nWe expect our M&A capital deployment to moderate as well in 2025 to a range of $300 million to $350 million as our investment in U.S. automotive returns to a more normalized level of activity. As we start 2025, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions including advancing our global restructuring activities to improve the profitability of the business. We believe the backdrop of lower sales growth is market driven not specific to our business, and we stand well positioned once the cycle turns more favorable.\nWe remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business, and we'll continue to invest in the business with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Genuine Parts Co.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report our first quarter results for Genuine Parts Company, and we are encouraged by the start to 2024, particularly when compared to our strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. Our results in the quarter reflect and highlight the value of our business mix paired with our geographic diversity. Our team delivered results that exceeded our expectations. While they stayed laser-focused on our strategic initiatives to enhance our businesses and drive profitable growth. This strong start to the year, along with the continued execution of our initiatives, gives us confidence to raise our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2024. Bert will provide additional details in his remarks.\nA few highlights of the first quarter include: Total GPC sales of $5.8 billion increased slightly versus the same period in the prior year, which produced nearly double-digit growth. Total company segment margin increased 30 basis points as continued operating discipline at Motion and solid momentum in the actions implemented at our U.S. auto business improved our profitability. And lastly, we delivered mid-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth from the same period last year.\nAs we look to the broader macroeconomic environment, the start to 2024 continues to present a mix of challenges and opportunities. Higher interest rates and persistent cost inflation are pressuring businesses and consumers alike. Fortunately, our businesses enjoy supportive industry fundamentals, providing a positive backdrop for growth. Within our global automotive business, we continue to see an increase in the number of miles driven. The fleet continues to age and new and used car pricing remains elevated, particularly with financing costs.\nOn the industrial side of our business, we have recently begun to see positive movement with key industry metrics. This further supports our positive outlook for Motion business for the balance of the year. Our Motion business benefits from a highly diverse portfolio of customers and end markets. Motion serves nearly all aspects of the industrial and manufacturing economy and is not over-indexed to any one end market or a customer. In addition, we continue to expand into new areas of opportunities such as semiconductor technology. Longer term, trends around reshoring present a significant opportunity for Motion, and the team is well positioned to capitalize on those as they materialize.\nAs we expected, sales were challenged in the first quarter as the team posted a slight year-over-year sales decline. Despite the more challenging top line environment, the Motion team delivered exceptional profit conversion. We are pleased with the progress with our supply chain initiatives and enhanced data analytics, which are driving an inventory productivity, lower cost and higher customer service levels. We expect Motion's business to accelerate through the year, particularly in the second half of 2024.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to announce the promotion of James Howe [ to ] President of Motion North America. James has nearly 3 decades of service to the company, and most recently served as EVP and Chief Commercial and Technology Officer. His leadership in overseeing e-commerce, strategic pricing, sales excellence and corporate account has been instrumental in driving the company's recent success. James is supported by a deep bench of talent, both in the field and amongst its leadership team.\nLast week, we had the chance to visit our Motion team at their Birmingham headquarters and tour their new learning development center. This is a great example of investing for future success as we provide intensive training for both our customers as well as our technical field teams. So now moving on to automotive.\nOur teams in Europe and Australasia continues to perform well and grow market share. In addition, our team in the U.S. demonstrated solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in both sales and profit, after a challenging 2023. The improvement was driven by the continued progress on the decisive actions we took at U.S. auto over the past several quarters. We're really proud of our leadership team for their focus and execution and are confident they will continue to drive sequential improvements as we progress through 2024.\nLooking ahead, we believe the GPC team is well positioned with the right strategic plans, supportive fundamentals and a strong balance sheet to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. Our results in the first quarter reflect the progress our teams around the globe are making on our key investment pillars and believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our team's relentless focus on our customers will drive value for our shareholders both now and for years to come.\nSo in closing, we thank each of our over 60,000 GPC teammates around the globe for taking great care of our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC teams for their ongoing dedication to taking care of our customers. We're pleased with the solid start to the year and our first quarter performance. We truly appreciate your hard work and commitment. As always, we're aligned with global strategic initiatives centered on 5 key priorities: including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, complemented by disciplined and value-creating acquisitions. Our global focus around these priorities drives efficiency and pace as we work to continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Now turning to our first quarter results.\nDuring the first quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 2% with comparable sales down 2.6% versus the same period last year. These results were in line with our expectations as we were up against our most difficult comparative period of the year with first quarter 2023 sales up 12%. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were flat to slightly down in all 3 months, with January seem the most pressure, partially driven by a negative impact from severe winter weather that caused some customer facilities to close.\nMotion continues to see mixed results across our various served industrial end markets, with strength during the quarter in iron and steel as well as chemicals and automotive. Equipment and machinery and lumber and building products were softer in the quarter relative to the average end market. We continue to receive mixed and cautious feedback from our diversified customer base, However, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. Current renewal rates for corporate accounts, which represents approximately 45% of the business, remain at historically high levels, which further validates the current strength of the motion value proposition. We're seeing outsized growth in our offering to physically locate motion teammates at customers' facilities to enable an even closer partnership.\nMotion's highly technical sales expertise and solution-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep our customers' operations moving every day. Over the past 16 months, manufacturing PMI readings have experienced the longest period of contraction as represented by a PMI index below [ 50 ] since the financial crisis in 2009. Despite this, our Motion business has outperformed, driven by its customer and end market diversification, business mix and strategic initiatives. Encouragingly, in March 2024, the manufacturing PMI was [ 50.3 ], representing an expansionary data point for the first time in 16 months. We obviously appreciate that 1 month doesn't make a trend but we remain cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the medium-term outlook.\nTurning to Industrial segment profit, which represents now 50% of GPC's total profit. In the first quarter, segment profit was $271 million, up 3% and 12.3% of sales, representing a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. The team continues to execute category management and supply chain productivity initiatives and operate with discipline to deliver operating leverage and margin expansion despite lower sales. Turning to the Global Automotive segment.\nSales in the first quarter increased approximately 2% with comparable store sales essentially flat. Our international automotive businesses in Europe and Asia Pac posted positive sales growth in local currency. While U.S. Automotive was flat and sales in Canada were down low single digits. As expected, global automotive sales inflation moderated to less than 1%, and we expect this to be the case throughout the remainder of the year. Global Automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $273 million, up 3% and 7.6% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year and a meaningful sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflects strong operating discipline and a positive initial impact that we're seeing from actions taken at our U.S. Automotive business. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in this segment. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography.\nStarting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another solid quarter with total sales growth of 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 1%. Our team continues to deliver growth with key accounts, winning a higher share of wallet with existing accounts and the further rollout of NAPA private label products across the region. The ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity continues to have a positive impact and create value. In addition, during the quarter, our new national DC in France opened. This approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center represents a significant technology and automation upgrade within our local supply chain. This project is a great example of how we're investing to optimize our network to drive productivity and increase service levels to our customers. A similar project is well underway in the U.K., and we're leveraging best practices and technologies to deliver the project efficiently.\nIn the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased 2% in local currency, with comparable sales growth of 1%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to strong double-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the first quarter with retail showing relative strength. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team is executing well to simultaneously deliver growth and expand operating margins. In Canada, sales decreased approximately 1% in local currency during the first quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 3%. Our Canadian team continues to focus on sales growth in excess of the market despite pressure from a more cautious consumer and an unseasonably mild winter.\nDuring the quarter, our automotive business saw positive sales growth in line with our expectations, while our heavy vehicle business was slightly below driven by softer-than-expected market demand. In the U.S., automotive sales were essentially flat during the first quarter, with comparable sales increasing approximately 1%. This represents a notable improvement from the fourth quarter in both reported and comparable sales. The first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we moved through the quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in average daily sales growth each month.\nDuring the quarter, we also saw positive buying behaviors from our independent owners, a trend that we expect to continue over the course of the year. From a customer segment perspective, sales to commercial customers in the quarter were slightly down, while sales to do-it-yourself customers were approximately flat. For commercial, AutoCare continued to outperform, while major accounts underperformed driven by a cautious end consumer. We believe the in-flight actions across the business are delivering a positive impact and we expect the benefits to build throughout the year. Let me provide another quick update on some of the focus areas.\nFirst, we experienced further improvement in our inventory fill rates during the first quarter. And as expected, our actions significantly improved our in-stock levels in both our stores and distribution centers. Second, our in-store service levels as measured by customer service and on-time delivery metrics improved following the improvements we experienced in the fourth quarter. Related to start the second quarter of 2024, we realigned certain field teams to help focus the field on key activities, deliver excellent customer service and generate sales growth. Our elevated focus on the stores and the field operations is having a measurable positive impact on our teammates. The team is energized, and we've seen a notable reduction in employee turnover year-over-year.\nFinally, our supply chain teams are making significant operational improvements across our network. We've enhanced processes and procedures in our operations that are driving better safety accuracy, service levels and operational efficiency while simultaneously reducing errors and over time. During the quarter, we also made progress on medium-term strategic initiatives. For example, we continue to build upon our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives that are delivering results. During the quarter, our newly expanded DC in Indianapolis went live. The 600,000 square foot facility will more efficiently service hundreds of independent and company-owned stores in the U.S., utilizing new automation and enhanced technology. We also leveraged our partnership with Google to accelerate enhancements to our search and catalog that remove friction and drive a better customer experience. The feedback on these technology improvements from our customers and teams has been exceptional, and we look forward to building on the momentum in the months and quarters ahead.\nAnd finally, as announced on our fourth quarter call, we're advancing our initiative to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive as we're being more intentional about owning more stores in selected priority markets. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operations at both company-owned and independently owned locations.\nDuring the first quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 45 NAPA stores from our independent owners, an increase from the 33 NAPA stores acquired in the fourth quarter and the 16 acquired in the first quarter of last year. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We expect these trends to continue over the course of the year. Our global teams are executing on our 2024 priorities and are focused on key strategic initiatives across our business. Last quarter, we announced a coordinated global initiative across each of our operations to further simplify and streamline our operations, improve productivity, increase our speed of service and reduce our cost to serve. Our efforts are on track, and Bert will go over the restructuring details in a moment.\nIn closing, GPC started 2024 well. We delivered first quarter results that exceeded our expectations. We're cautiously optimistic about the North America industrial recovery. We're seeing encouraging traction at U.S. Automotive. We're making progress on our long-term strategic initiatives. And we're confident in the revised outlook that we laid out for 2024. These results are only achieved with the hard work and dedication of each of our global teammates who take care of our customers live our GPC values and focus to deliver performance. We remain committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value.\nThank you again to the entire GPC team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our momentum from 2023 carried into the first quarter of 2024 as our teams delivered profit growth against the backdrop of low sales growth. We are pleased with the start to the year, which was ahead of our expectations, particularly as we anticipated this quarter to be the most challenging given the strong results we delivered in the first quarter of 2023. My comments this morning focused primarily on adjusted results, which exclude nonrecurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program.\nDuring the first quarter, we incurred approximately $83 million of costs on a pretax basis, in line with our expectations or $62 million after tax related to our restructuring efforts. As we look at the first quarter, total sales were up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting a 1.9% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales, and a 0.7% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations.\nOur first quarter sales performance was highlighted by the continued growth in Europe and Australasia, offset by slight declines in Industrial and Canada. Sales in our U.S. Automotive business were flat in the first quarter, and our performance reflects a more than 500 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, our gross margin expanded by 100 basis points to 35.9%, primarily driven by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to be beneficial in driving positive results and our gross margin performance.\nAdjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and nonoperating expenses were 28.8% of sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 90 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. Our higher operating expenses in the first quarter reflect a negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from planned investments in IT as we continue to invest and modernize technology to run our businesses. Approximately 25 basis points of negative impact from rent expense as inflationary pressures are contributing to higher cost as we renew leases. And approximately 70 basis points of negative impact from salaries and wages, as we lapped the final quarter of our previously announced 2023 investments in team members and absorbed continued mandatory increases in minimum wages in certain international markets. These headwinds were partially offset by discipline in other discretionary categories. And looking ahead, our operating expenses will benefit from the actions taken under our global restructuring program.\nFor the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Industrial delivered 70 basis points of margin improvement, while sales declined slightly. Our margin expansion in our Industrial business is a result of ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations, combined with strong expense discipline. As Will outlined earlier, the actions we've implemented to improve our U.S. automotive business are driving benefits, and we are encouraged with the margin expansion at Global Automotive and expect further improvement throughout the year.\nOur first quarter adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses of $62 million after tax or $0.44 per diluted share was $311 million or $2.22 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $304 million or $2.14 per diluted share in 2023, an increase of 3.7%. Turning to our cash flows.\nFor the quarter, we generated $318 million in cash from operations and $203 million in free cash flow. We closed the first quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. During the first quarter, we invested $116 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures and another $135 million in the form of strategic acquisitions, including bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. to support our strategy to own more NAPA stores. In addition, we also made a small acquisition for our Motion business in North America, which expands our value-added service capabilities like fluid power and repair solutions.\nIn the first quarter, we returned approximately $170 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $133 million and cash dividends paid to our shareholders and approximately $37 million in cash used to repurchase 261,000 shares. Our global restructuring efforts kicked off in the first quarter as we implement actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. We continue to expect costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million, most of which will be incurred in 2024, and we will report these as nonrecurring expenses. Our restructuring efforts are expected to deliver a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis.\nWe incurred $83 million of costs in the first quarter related to our restructuring program, which can be categorized into 2 key areas: costs associated with our voluntary retirement program and facility optimization. Approximately 65% of the first quarter restructuring expenses were the costs associated with our voluntary retirement offer. The remaining costs are related to facility closures and start-up costs associated with new facilities, that replaced those that were shut down. Our first quarter restructuring activities, including the voluntary retirement offer were completed in line with our expectations, and we expect to start realizing benefits in the second quarter. Turning to our guidance.\nWhile the macroeconomic backdrop remains dynamic, industry fundamentals remain supportive, and we are confident in our team's ability to drive results. With that in mind, we are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2024 and reaffirming our sales guidance. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. And with a more moderated first half and stronger second half for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments.\nFor gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. This compares to our previous guidance of 20 to 40 basis points of gross margin expansion. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points, primarily from further investments in technology. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts will be in the range of $9.05 to $9.20 and compared to our previous outlook of $8.95 to $9.15. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.80 to $9.95 and an increase of 5% to 6.6% from 2023. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.70 to $9.90.\nBy business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. For Global Automotive segment margin, we continue to expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest.\nWe are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with 4 priorities: capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience.\nAs we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust, and we will remain disciplined in evaluating opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around stores at our U.S. Automotive business. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth and strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. Overall, we are pleased and encouraged with our first quarter results as our teams continue to remain agile and deliver in this dynamic environment. Our outlook for 2024 reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and the actions we are taking to better align our business. We look forward to updating you on our progress in July.\nThank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Donahue\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Genuine Parts Co.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company delivered on our financial commitments in 2023 and finished the year with a solid fourth quarter. Will and Bert will cover our results in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights. During 2023, total GPC sales topped $23 billion an increase of nearly $1 billion from the prior year and in line with our expectations. We improved our total company segment profit margins by 50 basis points to nearly double digits, and we had our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.\nAnd notably, we returned $788 million to our shareholders this year and today, we announced that our Board approved a 68th consecutive annual increase to the dividend. Our teams around the globe delivered a strong performance while remaining focused on our long-term strategic initiatives to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 60,000 GPC teammates across the world for their dedication and hard work.\nOur fourth quarter and full year results again demonstrate the value of our complementary business mix paired with our geographic diversity. At our Investor Day back in March of 2023, we showcased our strategic initiatives and announced long-term financial targets for the first time in our history, all focused on delivering for our customers and delivering shareholder value. Clearly, this past year had its share of challenges and opportunities, but our performance in 2023 with a good start to achieve our 3-year goals highlighted by the following: our motion team completed the integration of Command Distribution Group, and we exceeded our synergy target a full year ahead of plan.\nAs an integrated business, Motion is a clear leader in their space, providing industrial aftermarket solutions with a compelling value proposition to more than 200,000 customers around the world. In addition, during 2023, Motion continued to roll out their fulfillment center strategy, which is driving cost efficiencies inventory productivity and improved customer service levels. During the fourth quarter, I had a chance to visit our fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida, and I can't say enough positive things about the team and their dedication to serving our customers.\nWe're excited about the rollout of these facilities in 2024 and 2025. Within automotive, our international automotive businesses outperformed our expectations in 2023. Our European team continues to expand their presence and gained market share through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. In 2023, we expanded our presence in Spain Europe's fifth largest car park with the acquisition of Gaudi, securing our position as the leader in this strategic market. And finally, the rollout of NAPA branded product in the European market has continued to surpass our expectations, a testament to the strength of the NAPA brand.\nIn Australasia, our team is profitably growing market share with their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth on top of industry-leading sales growth. Our supply chain investments in the region have improved the customer experience while driving productivity in our business. In North America, while results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives and continue to make solid progress. We've undertaken a comprehensive review of the NAPA business to identify key issues, and we have taken action to improve the performance at NAPA.\nWe are confident we are focused on the right initiatives to positively impact our performance in the quarters ahead. These initiatives, along with plans for long-term investments were rolled out to our field leadership teams and across our independent owner group in December. The team's competitive drive and energy were on full display, and we know that the best days for NAPA are in front of us. And finally, as part of our long-term growth strategy, our teams continue to expand our footprint through bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, our global automotive store count expanded by 173 net new stores up approximately 2% from 2022.\nWe remain disciplined on our playbook for acquisitions and are confident in our ability to continue seamlessly integrating future businesses across all our segments and geographies to create value for our shareholders. As we look ahead to 2024, we are seeing supportive industry fundamentals in both the automotive and industrial end markets. Within our global automotive business, we continue to see an increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs all supportive for the automotive aftermarket, and we remain uniquely positioned in this space with our global footprint.\nWithin our industrial business, macro indicators like industrial production, and the Purchasing Managers Index continue to show improvement after 15 months of contraction. We stand to benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets and we are well positioned now and in the future to capitalize on reshoring trends. While industry fundamentals remain supportive, broader macroeconomic factors like high interest rates, and persistent inflation in everyday purchases are pressuring the consumer and businesses alike.\nThat said, the vast majority of parts and solutions we provide across both businesses our brake fix and nondiscretionary in nature. In our business, parts availability is paramount, and we are leveraging our enhanced data analytics and science to have the right part in the right place at the right time. As we continue to navigate the environment in 2024, it is imperative that we remain agile and move forward with a sense of urgency. Given current market conditions, we need to continuously take action to position our business for long-term success.\nThis morning, we announced a global restructuring initiative to further simplify and streamline our business. Will and Bert will share more about the specific actions we are taking, along with the financial implications. So in closing, we are proud to have delivered on our financial commitments for 2023. We accomplished this while taking decisive actions to improve our NAPA business in the U.S. while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth, we believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our team's relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, both now and for years to come. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC team for another great year and for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the year, we also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, many of which we shared at our Investor Day last March.\nGlobally, we align our strategic initiatives around 5 foundational priorities, which include talent and culture, sales effectiveness technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by disciplined and value-creating M&A. Our focus around these priorities drives global team alignment as we continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth.\nTurning to our results by business segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.1 billion, an increase of 2% with comparable sales growth of 1% versus the same period last year and 18% on a 2-year basis. Average daily sales were essentially flat in October with low single-digit growth in both November and December. Motion saw mixed results across its various end markets similar to last quarter, with particular strength in iron and steel, chemicals and mining.\nCategories like equipment and machinery and oil and gas were underperformers relative to the fourth quarter average. Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives, including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share and improve productivity. For the full year, Motion sales grew $414 million or 5% with comparable sales of 5% and 22% on a 2-year basis.\nI'd like to take a quick moment to highlight our Motion team in Asia Pacific, who delivered a fantastic year. Sales and profit were up double digits in 2023 and the team continues to outperform our expectations. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $275 million, up 19% and 12.9% sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, Industrial segment profit was $1.1 billion up 24% and 12.5% of sales, representing a 200 basis point increase from the same period last year and exceeding the 2025 target that we set at our Investor Day.\nBert will take you through more detail on our outlook for the Industrial segment margin but we're confident that our strategic initiatives can continue to deliver margin expansion. Throughout 2023, the profit improvement in Industrial was primarily driven by strategic pricing excellent operating discipline, the execution of our productivity initiatives and the accelerated integration of KDG.\nWhen we announced the acquisition of KDG in December of 2021 we set a target of approximately $50 million of synergies to be accomplished over a 3-year period. We're proud to say that the integration of KDG is complete, and we've realized $70 million of synergies a full year ahead of schedule. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. During the fourth quarter, our international Automotive businesses posted positive sales growth in local currency, while sales declined at U.S. Automotive.\nTotal sales for global automotive increased approximately 1% for the quarter, with comparable store sales decreasing 3%. For the full year, total sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 4% with comparable store sales increasing 2%, in line with our guidance. The moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continues to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, global automotive sales inflation moderated throughout the year and ended the year in the low single-digit range compared to a high single-digit range in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nGlobal Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $259 million and segment operating margin was 7.5%, down 110 basis points. In the fourth quarter, all of our international geographies delivered margin expansion although global Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by the performance at U.S. Automotive. For the full year, Automotive segment profit decreased approximately 1% versus the same period last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year.\nNow let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 4%. For the year, total sales growth was 16% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 8%. We're winning profitable market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we saw low single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. And for the year, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our markets. This was driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand, generating over $400 million in the region, which exceeds our internal target for 2023. Congratulations to the entire AAG team for another outstanding year.\nIn the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. This compares to strong double-digit growth in the comparable period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the fourth quarter. The team is executing well, converting the sales momentum in the quarter into strong operating margin expansion. For the year, sales increased 7% in local currency and comparable sales increased 6%. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the year with commercial growth up mid-single digits and retail growth up high single digits.\nOur Asia Pacific team had another fantastic year and their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. They continue to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically invest for long-term success. Congratulations again to the Asia Pacific team on another great year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 1% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 1%.\nFor the year, total sales grew 5% in local currency, with comparable sales increasing 4%. We're pleased with the Canadian team's growth this year and the execution of their strategic initiatives despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer in Canada. In the U.S., automotive sales declined 5.6% during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales down 6.1%. A reminder that our comparable sales figure includes same-store sales out from our company-owned stores as well as same-store sales into our independent owned stores.\nIn the quarter, sales to commercial customers were down low single digits, while sales to DIY customers were down mid-single digits. For commercial, NAPA Auto Care saw low single-digit growth while major accounts sales were down mid-single digits. Let me provide an update on the priority actions we're taking at NAPA that we explained on our third quarter call. We detailed 3 key areas to improve, including operational rigor in our stores, addressing fill rates in key product categories and working with our commercial teams to address growth opportunities in the field.\nFirst, we completed changes to certain key suppliers to improve fill rates. The changes have improved category trends in the fourth quarter, and we're encouraged by the positive momentum. Second, our in-store service levels measured by on-time delivery to customers have significantly improved as a result of increased focus on last mile operating disciplines. Lastly, our commercial efforts are ongoing and were highlighted by the appointment of Tom Skov to a newly created role of EVP sales and store operations for NAPA.\nPreviously serving as a Division Vice President in the West. Tom has over 20 years of field sales and operations experience with NAPA. He's an automotive parts expert and has a deep understanding of our customers field sales and store operations. We're excited for the strong leadership Tom will bring to our sales and store operations field teams. While these actions drove encouraging improvements, the fourth quarter results at NAPA still missed our expectations.\nAs we mentioned previously, the fourth quarter and December in particular, were difficult year-over-year sales comparisons for NAPA. Our average daily sales growth for NAPA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 10%, which included approximately 8% benefit from inflation with December 2022 sales up 13%. As expected, the benefit from inflation did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, December 2022 included the benefits of extreme winter weather for most of the U.S.\nWith that context, as we look within the current fourth quarter for U.S. Automotive, the first 2 months of the quarter were in line with our outlook that we shared last quarter. December performance, however, was well below our expectations, driven by unseasonably warm weather and moderated purchases from our independent owners. We have the opportunity to be with many of our largest owners at a week-long meeting in December. It was a productive series of discussions with high energy and good engagement.\nThe outlook for the market fundamentals remains positive. We reviewed areas of commercial focus and detailed key initiatives to deliver profitable growth together. The NAPA competitive spirit is certainly high. A theme from the owner's feedback highlighted ongoing efforts to manage their purchases as they balance operating costs in the current environment. Based on the session feedback, however, we remain optimistic that owners purchasing behaviors return to more normal patterns in 2024, and we're encouraged by the performance in January, albeit it's only 1 month.\nAs we reflect on 2023 and move forward, we will continue to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive. We will be more intentional about owning more stores. A higher mix of company-owned stores in targeted priority markets enables us to service our repair shop and commercial customers more consistently and completely. We are also working actively to better align incentives with our independent owners to partner and grow together. We have current and future opportunities to create value in both our owned and independent owned locations.\nAs an example, during the fourth quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 33 NAPA stores from our independent owners, ending the year with approximately 1,560 company-owned stores up 20% versus 2021. While owner acquisitions have been a long-standing aspect of the business, these trends accelerated in the fourth quarter and second half of 2023. And we would expect these accelerated trends to continue into 2024.\nThe NAPA business navigated unexpected challenges in 2023 and but the team adjusted and took decisive action to step up our operational intensity, simplify our priorities and improve service to our customers. As we look back during the year, a few highlights. We brought in new leadership with Randy Brow now leading the team and a proven internal leader as the new CFO. These seasoned executives got to work quickly identifying opportunities and improved our business clarity and priorities.\nWe quickly assessed costs and took action to increase productivity and efficiency. We partnered with new suppliers to address poor fill rates in select key categories and surgically invested in inventory breadth and depth. We identified opportunities within our stores and DCs to improve our processes to ensure that we're delivering our customer commitments and executing locally. We accelerated progress on foundational talent, technology and supply chain investments, including as one example, a strategic global partnership with Google for analytics and search.\nAnd we're encouraged by some recent wins, including a structured inside sales program, planned introduction of new product lines and recent traction with loyalty programs with key customers. In 2024, we believe that supportive industry fundamentals combined with clear priorities and urgent action position NAPA to deliver success. For GPC, overall, our global teams are already actively executing 2024 priorities, focused on our key strategic initiatives across our businesses.\nWe know evolving market environments require us to continuously evolve with them. And to that end, as Paul mentioned, we announced a coordinated restructuring program across each of our global geographies. The primary objective of the global program is to continue to simplify and streamline our operations, consistent with our overall business strategy. When we simplify, we increase the speed of local service deliver operational productivity, improve the efficiency of our teams and reduce our overall cost to serve.\nThis program is a similar playbook to our previous GPC program implemented in fall 2019 that delivered positive results. Aspects of the restructuring are already in flight and some will take place in the months ahead. Bert will go over the financial details of our restructuring and his remarks and update you on how it's reflected in our 2024 outlook.\nIn closing, GPC delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results, and we achieved the plan we laid out for 2023. This was driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Most importantly, it was driven by incredible effort from our global teammates to take care of our customers, live our GPC values every day and deliver performance.\nWe're committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for another great year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year continues to demonstrate our long history of delivering earnings and cash flow growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results, which include double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for 2023 were achieved while navigating through a dynamic and challenging year. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2023.\nOur comparisons to prior year, however, exclude nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG and an adjustment in the fourth quarter related to a remeasurement of our product liability reserve. As we look at 2023, sales totaled $23.1 billion, up 4.5% from 2022 and consistent with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 1.1% and with a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% favorable impact of foreign currency and other.\nThese items were partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in comparable sales. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit levels of inflation in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations. As Will outlined, our fourth quarter sales performance was highlighted by the growth in Europe, Australasia and industrial, offset by the decline in U.S. Automotive.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our gross margin expanded by approximately 70 basis points. And for the year, our gross margin was 35.9%, an 80 basis point improvement from our adjusted gross margin in 2022. Our gross margin expansion was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives through investments in technology that enabled us to leverage data and analytics to ensure we have the right inventory for our customers to meet their needs. Total operating and nonoperating expenses were 28.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from total adjusted expenses in the prior year.\nFor the year, total expenses were 28.4% of sales, a 50 basis point increase from adjusted expenses in 2022. During 2023, we anticipated 60 basis points of deleverage related to our planned investments in team members and increased spending in technology, both of which came in line with our expectations. These investments were partially offset by cost actions throughout the year, particularly at U.S. Automotive.\nDespite the deleverage in SG&A, our fourth quarter gross margin expansion drove segment profit margin up 10 basis points to 9.6%. For the year, segment profit margin was 9.9%, a notable 50 basis point increase from 2022 and highlighted by our team at Motion driving an impressive 200 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit sales growth with industrial now representing approximately 50% of GPC's profit pool. Our fourth quarter earnings were $2.26 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per adjusted diluted share in the same period last year, an increase of 10.2%.\nFor the full year, earnings were $9.33 per diluted share compared to $8.34 per adjusted diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.9%. Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and over $900 million in free cash flow, both in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior unsecured notes and used $250 million of the proceeds to repay debt that matured in December 2023.\nWe closed the year with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. Our capital expenditures in 2023, which totaled approximately $500 million or 2.2% of revenue, we're focused on driving the strategic initiatives we showcased at our March 2023 Investor Day.\nFor 2023, 60% of our CapEx was growth capital centered on technology and supply chain capabilities, including projects related to distribution center expansion and modernization, fulfillment centers at Motion and using technology to enhance our catalog and payment platforms. While modestly above our original expectations, the areas where we are investing are delivering good returns well above our cost of capital. We continue to make progress on the M&A front in 2023, a long-standing aspect of our growth strategy.\nDuring the year, we completed approximately 90 transactions, investing $309 million, with virtually all of these transactions in the Automotive segment. The blended EBITDA rate of the businesses acquired was over 9% on a pre-synergy basis and is accretive to our overall Automotive segment margin, demonstrating the discipline we have in the space. In 2023, we returned approximately $788 million or 55% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nThis includes $527 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $261 million in cash used to repurchase 1.8 million shares. Before we turn to our outlook for 2024, as you heard earlier from Paul and Will, this morning, we announced a global restructuring designed to reduce our SG&A costs, improve efficiency and accelerate investments. In 2024, we expect to incur costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million related to our restructuring efforts, and we will report this as a nonrecurring expense.\nThrough these efforts, we anticipate a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. Our current restructuring activities reflect our discipline to continuously refine and improve our business and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets.\nAs we turn to 2024, we are balancing solid industry fundamentals, which remain supportive for long-term growth across our businesses against a backdrop of mixed economic conditions, driven by high interest rates and persistent cost inflation. Despite this, we remain confident in the execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect to realize.\nFor the year, we expect total sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate a more moderated first half and stronger second half in 2024 for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments. We are targeting full year gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives.\nOur outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points from further investments in technology. Our technology investments are key to enabling our strategic initiatives. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90, which represents an increase of 4% to 6% to last year.\nOur adjusted earnings per share guidance includes approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit related to our restructuring initiatives, which represents about half of the savings we are targeting for 2024. The successful execution of all our restructuring initiatives in 2024 provides an additional $0.05 to $0.10 EPS benefit, not included in our guidance. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range.\nAs we consider our sales guidance for automotive, our growth rate will be negatively impacted in 2024 and by approximately 100 basis points from new incentive programs associated with changes to certain supplier arrangements we previously announced in the U.S. Automotive business. Historically, these programs have been managed by our suppliers. Under the new arrangements, these will be managed by our U.S. automotive team. The new arrangements will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue, however, have a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and as a result, have no negative impact to gross profit.\nFor Global Automotive segment margin, we expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year after finishing 2023 at 12.5%.\nOur performance in 2023 exceeded our long-term target of 12%, driven in part by our outstanding work to integrate KDG a year ahead of schedule. We will revisit our long-term target for Industrial in the future, but we see further opportunities for margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest.\nWith our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with 4 priorities: capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we added a new capability and further flexibility to pursue strategic investments with our commercial paper program launched in December. Our cash flows will remain strong in 2024 as we expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. As we outlined at Investor Day, investments in our supply chain and IT capabilities are central to our success.\nFor 2024, we expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue, consistent with 2023. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast will drive modernization of our supply chain through automation and new DCs and fulfillment locations that are partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience like our investments in catalog and search platforms through our partnership with Google.\nAs we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value. Our strong track record of success, combined with our ability to put our balance sheet to work positions us well to further grow our global scale and footprint. In maintaining our focus on shareholder returns, this morning, our Board approved a $4 per share annual dividend for 2024, representing our 68th consecutive increase to our annual dividend. This represents a 5.3% increase from the $3.80 per share paid in 2023.\nIn closing, our teams managed the business through a dynamic environment in 2023. And including navigating unexpected pressures in our U.S. automotive business, while achieving mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to strategically invest in our business for the long term while taking actions to better align our assets in the near term and maintain our strong balance sheet.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Donahue\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Genuine Parts Co.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'd like to start this morning with a few remarks on our overall performance before turning it over to Will to cover the highlights of the automotive and industrial businesses. And then Bert will get into the details of our financial performance before we open the call to your questions.\nTo recap the third quarter, total GPC sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year. Total company segment margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year, and diluted earnings per share were $2.49 and an increase of 11.7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. I want to take this opportunity to give a call out to our GPC teammates around the globe as we delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.\nOur third quarter results reflect our strong operating discipline and our ability to improve our operating margins and profits despite a more challenging top line environment. Overall, we continue to benefit from solid industry fundamentals in both the automotive and industrial end markets, including rational pricing environments in both segments. In our global automotive business, the underlying fundamentals of the aftermarket remained favorable, increasing miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs.\nWithin our Global Industrial business, we benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets with overall growth driven by manufacturing and opportunities with onshoring and reshoring trends. Our automotive and industrial businesses are mostly break fix and nondiscretionary in nature. And as a result, we remain focused on offering solutions that support our customers to have the right part in the right place at the right time across both business segments. Sales in our industrial business were up slightly in the third quarter, and the team continues to deliver exceptional profit conversion as evidenced by 180 basis points of segment margin expansion. During the quarter, demand trends were positive, but continued to moderate relative to the first half as expected. Over time, Motion has transformed its business into an industrial solutions provider with a compelling value proposition. Motion serves diverse end markets with many of its product offerings being highly technical in nature.\nIn addition, with the acquisition of KDG, Motion has added scale and enhanced its industry-leading offering of value-added services, such as fluid power, automation, conveyance and repair. The Motion team is focused on executing on our strategic initiatives to expand gross margin while remaining disciplined on cost, driving further segment margin expansion. Turning now to our global automotive business. We continue to see strong results across our international automotive businesses with the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in Europe and record sales and profits in Australia and New Zealand. Our teams continue to focus on our key organic initiatives in addition to our bolt-on acquisition strategy. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Gaudi, one of the largest independent players in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park, building on our 2022 acquisition of Lasan, Gaudi mainly operates in the Catalonia and Madrid regions and creates further scale and a national platform across Iberia with the addition of 22 stores to our market-leading position. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to our European business post synergies. We welcome the Goudy team to GPC. While we were pleased with the growth internationally, the U.S. automotive business performance was below our expectations with sales down 1.1%. Let me take a moment to share a few thoughts on the performance at U.S. auto. There is no doubt we've seen some challenges in 2023 from the record levels of inflation seen a year ago, which benefited the industry and have faded throughout 2023, as anticipated the challenges across our own execution. Our year-to-date results demonstrated that we have not operated to our full potential in 2023. We -- as many of you know, success in the automotive aftermarket is highly dependent on availability of inventory, particularly for the important IFM customer, which represents approximately 80% of our automotive revenue. Further, the automotive aftermarket has demonstrated consistent performance throughout all economic cycles. As we close out 2023, we are taking actions to better service our customers and ensure our commercial activities are where they need to be. Under the leadership of Randy Bro, we are confident the U.S. Automotive team has taken the measures to improve execution with our customers. Will plans to discuss these actions in greater detail. And before passing the call over to Will, we'd like to highlight our 2023 sustainability report, which we published earlier this month. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to build a more sustainable and equitable future for our planet. This year's report highlights the progress we've made at the company to measure and reduce our carbon footprint. This year, we are proud to report that in 2022, we further improved the measurement of our carbon emissions and have reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by over 10%.We encourage you to visit the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress. So in closing, our performance in the third quarter, again, demonstrates our unique and differentiated portfolio. Will and I continue to visit with our global teams, including a recent trip to Europe and Australia. The teams are investing in the right areas of the business to drive long-term profitable growth, and they couldn't be more energized. We enjoyed the benefit of strong global brands and the GPC culture is alive and well across all our global operations.\nFurther, we remain committed to the strategic investments and initiatives that we highlighted at our Investor Day back in March. We believe these investments are critical to our long-term success and are contributing to our financial performance both now and for years to come. We want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking the global GPC team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the hard work every day to deliver parts and solutions that help keep the world moving. It's great to see the teams work together as 1 GPC team to deliver customer success. .\nWe do this with coordinated focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. To that end, I'd like to take a moment to specifically recognize the global teams for the progress on our numerous in-flight initiatives around the world.\nWe're executing a broad set of initiatives across our global business and making strong and steady progress. The teams are simultaneously working to evolve the business for the better while delivering on our day-to-day service commitments to our customers. As we detailed at our Investor Day, we believe we have compelling opportunities to invest back in the business and are excited about the progress and outlook. As Paul mentioned, we have great examples of progress around the world. Specific examples range from state-of-the-art distribution centers with automation and next-generation technology, enhanced data visibility and analytics capabilities, added talent and expertise modernized technology platforms to enhance growth and productivity and much, much more. We know that teams are working hard to execute the body of work. So thank you very much.\nNow turning to the details of the business segment results. Before I get into the specifics, I should mention that the third quarter had 1 less selling day in the U.S. when compared to the third quarter last year. This impacted our total sales and comparable sales growth versus prior year for both our industrial and automotive segments. During the quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. We estimate that the 1 less selling day negatively impacted global industrial sales growth by approximately 160 basis points.\nTotal sales for Global Automotive were $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.9% with a negative impact to global automotive of approximately 100 basis points due to the 1 less selling day. Now turning to the Global Industrial segment. Our quarterly results were essentially in line with our expectations, and we remain ahead of our year-to-date plans.\nRecall that our expectation was for industrial growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Comparable sales growth increased 0.3% and in the third quarter versus the same period last year. The same period last year was our highest quarterly comp during the year at approximately 20%. The monthly average daily sales cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with each month of the quarter up low single digits.\nDuring the quarter, Motion saw a more mixed result across its various end markets with the strongest growth coming from industries such as food products, iron and steel and mining offset by relative softness in equipment and machinery. As mentioned, Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology, and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share. As 1 example, the inside sales team initially formed in 2020 now covers approximately 25% of active customer accounts.\nThe proactive sales calls are helping to drive profitable double-digit growth across the selling channel with a lower cost to serve. Our technology investments supporting revenue growth are also helping deliver a better customer experience, with nearly 30% growth across e-commerce channels year-to-date and e-commerce now at over 30% of total sales, up approximately 6 percentage points since 2021.\nMotion's second new fulfillment center in Fort Mill, South Carolina is another example of exciting progress. This supply chain initiative consolidates various older legacy facilities while improving productivity, efficiency, speed and service to customers. Our first fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida opened at the end of 2021 and has delivered outsized sales growth a 10% reduction in operating expenses and corresponding profit margin expansion. We'll continue to roll out this strategy with additional fulfillment centers openings scheduled for 2024. In Asia Pac, our Motion team delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with double-digit sales and profit growth. The local teams are energized as reaffirmed by recent independent survey data showing high levels of team member engagement, combined with market-leading customer satisfaction rates.\nMotion is a trusted value-add adviser to its customers, and the team has detailed plans to win additional share in this fragmented market. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was approximately $283 million, up a strong 15.6% and at 12.9% of sales, representing a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in Industrial was driven by another quarter of excellent operating discipline in both North America and Australasia.\nThe accelerated integration of the KDG acquisition has contributed to the strong performance and we will exceed our $50 million synergy estimate by the end of this year. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Similar to the first half of the year, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification with our international auto businesses outperforming with mid-single-digit to double-digit sales growth in local currency. Comparable sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 0.6% in the third quarter, and by geography, include low to mid-single-digit growth in each of our international businesses and comparable sales of negative 2.9% in the U.S.\nThe moderation in inflation continues to be a significant factor in our year-over-year performance. As expected, global automotive sales inflation moderated in the third quarter to low single digits from mid-single digits in the second quarter. By comparison, in the third quarter of 2022, global Automotive benefited from high single-digit levels of sales inflation, which includes a benefit in the U.S. of approximately 10%. We expect sales inflation in global automotive to be low single digits in the fourth quarter.\nTotal automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $322 million, up approximately 4% versus the same period last year. and segment operating margin was 8.9%, flat with last year. In the quarter, each of our international geographies delivered margin expansion while U.S. Automotive segment margin was down due to expense deleverage related to planned investments and the impact of lower sales. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography.\nIn the U.S., as Paul outlined, automotive sales declined approximately 1% in the third quarter, with comparable sales down 2.9%, which includes the negative impact of 1 less selling day year-over-year, as I had previously mentioned. Further, the third quarter of last year included the benefit of sales associated with our NAPA Expo. A sales event held approximately every 5 years which negatively impacted our year-over-year comparisons by an estimated 170 basis points. Collectively, these 2 factors represent approximately 340 basis points of headwind in evaluating our year-over-year growth performance in the U.S. In the third quarter, sales to both commercial and retail customers were down slightly with commercial and DIY essentially performing at similar levels.\nOur commercial business was mixed in the quarter as fleet and government outperformed and major accounts remained pressured driven by the impact of tighter market conditions on the end consumer. The average daily sales cadence by month was July, slightly up, August down low single digits and we exited the quarter with September up low single digits. It's fair to say that our performance in the U.S. Automotive business was below our expectations. And we believe the underperformance is a combination of execution and further tightening of market conditions. On the execution side, we have not been crisp enough in the field with service to our customers.\nIn addition, while supply chains have improved significantly post pandemic, we've experienced some lingering issues with inventory availability in a few product categories. Finally, the impact of tightening market conditions, including higher interest rates and persistent levels of higher cost inflation has created a more cautious trading environment for our customers.\nDespite the challenges we're taking action. First, in terms of service in the field, we've taken actions to intensify our operational rigor at stores and DCs as well as further enhance our inventory strategies, powered by investments we've made in data analytics tools. Second, we've experienced fill rates below our acceptable levels in a few product categories. This fill rate performance has taken too long to remedy post pandemic.\nAnd as a result, our merchandising teams partnered with alternative suppliers to address the issue to ensure our markets are properly stocked. Finally, while we can't control the overall market conditions, we are working closely with field sales to drive incremental growth opportunities and we continue to be disciplined on costs, including ongoing cost actions, which Burt will discuss further.\nAs mentioned, we've underperformed our expectations at U.S. Automotive in 2023, but with new leadership in roll for 100 days now, the team has clarity of the priority opportunities has taken action and are quickly moving to get where we need to be. With solid industry fundamentals and the team's competitive drive to win, we're confident our U.S. automotive team is positioned to overcome our recent challenges and execute on our long-term strategy to profitably grow share.\nIn Canada, sales grew approximately 4% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. During the quarter, our automotive and heavy-duty businesses grew mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively, and we are pleased with the Canadian team execution of their strategic initiatives despite macroeconomic pressures and a cautious consumer. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of approximately 11% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. We continue to drive strong growth and market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions. During the third quarter, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies, driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand in the region. In addition, the team is making excellent progress on our new national distribution center in France that Paul Burton had a chance to visit. Scheduled to open in 2024, this 500,000 square foot facility helps evolve the network strategy and upgrades the level of technology and automation within our supply chain. This effort complements a similar investment in the U.K. and the teams are working well to leverage best practices.\nWe expect these facilities to further drive productivity and efficiency as well as increased service levels to our customers. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 6% in local currency, with comparable sales growth of approximately 5%. Sales for both commercial and retail were solid in the third quarter with retail growth slightly above commercial. Having recently visited with this world-class team, it's impressive to see the team consistently executing at such a high level and delivering another quarter of record sales and profitability. Our Asia Pac team is driving market share gains, improving profitability, increasing its employee value proposition, all while executing strategic initiatives to create long-term value.\nIn closing, the global GPC team delivered solid third quarter results driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. We remain committed to our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We're confident our teams are focused on the right long-term strategic initiatives that will deliver customer solutions and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for your hard work, your performance and your dedication to taking care of our customers.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the third quarter reflects the operating discipline in our business alongside the focus by our teams to serve our customers, which is evident with our double-digit earnings growth for the quarter. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our third quarter performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the third quarter and 9 months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG Total GPC sales increased 2.6% to $5.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023.\nThis reflects a 0.5% improvement in comparable sales which includes low single-digit levels of inflation, a 1.7% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.5% favorable impact of foreign currency. Our sales performance reflects ongoing strength in international auto, continued but moderating growth in industrial, offset by a decline in sales at U.S. Automotive.\nFurther, 1 less selling day in our U.S. businesses negatively impacted sales growth by an estimated 120 basis points. Our ongoing execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives were the primary driver of our strong gross margin expansion. Gross margin was 36.2% in the third quarter a 130 basis point improvement from the same period last year.\nGiven our performance year-to-date, we now expect our gross margin rate for the full year to improve 50 to 60 basis points from 2022 and an increase from our prior estimate of 30 to 50 basis points of improvement. Our total operating and nonoperating expenses in the third quarter were $1.6 billion or 28.2% of sales.\nThis compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.5% of sales in the third quarter last year or an increase of approximately 70 basis points. The SG&A deleverage in the third quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors: planned investments in wages and benefits for our teams and increased spending in technology to support our strategic initiatives. These investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by approximately 35 basis points, while investments in IT and digital impacted SG&A by approximately 25 basis points in the third quarter.\nAs you heard earlier from Will, within SG&A, the U.S. automotive team has been working hard to execute on cost improvement actions. The team has been successful in reducing headcount, implementing a hiring freeze and driving discipline around travel and other discretionary costs. These actions are on track and equate to approximately 15 to 20 basis points of benefit, which is embedded in our annual guidance and year-to-date results. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points based on our investments in our team members and IT.\nOur third quarter revenue growth and gross margin expansion drove total segment profit of $605 million, up 9.6%. The Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year and our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. This quarter's segment margin expansion is a clear reflection of the value of our portfolio diversification, highlighted by industrial, which now represents nearly 50% of GPC segment profit. While we delivered strong overall margin expansion driven by Industrial, our global automotive segment margin was flat due to U.S. automotive. We've demonstrated consistent improvement throughout 2023, and as Global Auto segment margins improved again sequentially.\nFurther, we have identified opportunities to improve execution at our U.S. automotive business and position the business to take share. With the combination of operating discipline and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives to drive further operational efficiencies and productivity for the year, we now expect GPC segment margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points, an increase of our previous outlook of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement. Our third quarter net income was $351 million or $2.49 per diluted share.\nThis compares to adjusted net income of $317 million or $2.23 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the first 9 months of 2023, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $733 million in free cash flow. We closed the third quarter with $2.2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x, highlighting our flexibility and the strength of our balance sheet.\nWe remain committed to our 4 key priorities of capital allocation, which include the investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $350 million in capital expenditures, including $145 million in the third quarter. We remain disciplined, investing in initiatives we believe will drive modernization and long-term growth for our business.\nAs acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, we invested $211 million year-to-date for acquisitions, including the investment in Goudy to expand our market-leading position in Iberia. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of bolt-on acquisition targets for our business. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned approximately $565 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $393 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $172 million in cash used to repurchase 1.1 million shares. We remain well positioned with solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet to effectively deploy our capital through any economic environment. Turning to our guidance. We continue to navigate a balanced mix of headwinds and tailwinds as we move into the fourth quarter. With that backdrop, we are reiterating our full year sales guidance and updating our diluted earnings per share guidance previously provided in our Q2 earnings release.\nWe now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.30, an increase of approximately 10.3% to 11.5% from 2022. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.15 to $9.30. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 and to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding for the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range.\nWithin this outlook, we expect international Automotive to be at the high end or above this range with U.S. automotive below. We also expect Global Automotive segment margin to be flat to slightly down for the year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 4% to 6% with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. As expected, the sales growth within this segment has moderated along with the industrial economy and our outlook includes low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter.\nFor the year, we now expect Global Industrial segment margin to expand by at least 150 basis points year-over-year. We are reaffirming our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow. We expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others.\nIn closing, our third quarter double-digit earnings growth demonstrates our ability to improve earnings and expand margins in low growth environments, backed by a strong balance sheet and returns to our shareholders through our dividend. Our teams are delivering on what we said we would do for 2023, including our expectations for mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth for the full year. We look forward to closing the year strong and reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our call in February.\nThank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. .\nToday's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSidney G.

The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Genuine Parts Co.\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with record sales and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our second quarter once again highlights the value and benefit of our global automotive and industrial businesses and the mix and geographic diversity of our company which we believe are competitive advantages that differentiate GPC in the marketplace.\nA few highlights from our second quarter results include: Total sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 5.6% from the prior year. Total company segment margin of 10.4% and an increase of 60 basis points from the same quarter last year. Earnings per share of $2.44, an increase of 10.9% from adjusted earnings per share last year and our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation priorities.\nOur global team remains focused on the strategic initiatives we highlighted at our Investor Day in March. And we believe our One GPC approach is contributing to our strong financial performance. We compete in 2 very large and fragmented markets and see significant opportunities to grow our business. Expand our margin profile and generate strong cash flow to support our strategic investments while delivering returns to our shareholders. As we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, we believe our focused execution, investments in our business and strong industry fundamentals, position GPC for long-term success.\nLooking at our Industrial segment, demand trends held solid through the second quarter, even as the rate of sales growth tempered a bit relative to the first quarter as we expected. Motion's growth rate on a 2-year basis continues to be exceptional. And while certain economic indicators have slowed, we believe our strong market share position, along with the diversity of our products, services and end markets bode well for our continued growth prospects.\nIn addition, future reshoring opportunities and the growth of domestic manufacturing industries provide significant opportunity for Motion. And as you will hear from Will, our team's focus on productivity and efficiency is driving significant margin expansion in the Industrial segment.\nOur global automotive business continues to benefit from the broad geographic diversity of our markets. In addition, we believe our long history of supporting the DIFM customer segment which is 80% of our global automotive sales, positions us well as sales growth to DIFM customers continues to outpace DIY sales growth.\nDuring the second quarter, our international Automotive businesses delivered strong mid-single to double-digit growth, while our U.S. automotive business experienced low single-digit growth.\nThe fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket remain favorable with trends such as increasing miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet, rising interest rates, and continued high prices for vehicles, all contributing to underlying demand.\nWhile the near-term environment remains dynamic, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. And with the strong earnings growth in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for 2023 earnings per share, which Bert will discuss further.\nAs we look forward, we remain confident in our strategic plans, and we'll continue to invest to strengthen our business and achieve both our near- and long-term financial targets while returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.\nSo in closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the outstanding work of our HR and IT teams in Q2 around our implementation of Workday. In early July, we completed the first phase of our implementation of the Workday HR platform in North America. Continuing to demonstrate the modernization of our system platforms and supporting our teams with the right tools and the right technology. Our HR and IT teams delivered an exceptional outcome, well ahead of schedule, showcasing the benefits of our One GPC talent and technology initiatives.\nSo before I turn it over to Will, we want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate all the hard work to take care of our customers every day with solutions that help keep the world moving. We do this with focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. We work together as 1 GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value.\nOn behalf of the entire GPC team, we would like to congratulate Kevin Herron on his well-deserved retirement after an amazing 34-year career at the company. Kevin earned success in all of his roles over the years, including the last 5 years as President of the U.S. Automotive business. He embodies our GPC values and it's been an inspirational leader and mentor to many around the world. We're deeply grateful for its significant contributions to Genuine Parts Company and wish him the very best in his retirement.\nWith Kevin's retirement, we also want to congratulate Randy Brow on his promotion to Group President, GPC North America effective July 1. In the new role, Randy will oversee both the automotive and industrial businesses across North America, while assuming day-to-day responsibility as President of the U.S. Automotive Group. Randy is a proven leader with a track record of performance. His relevant expertise across distribution industries, familiarity with GPC teammates and stakeholders and success at motion make him the ideal candidate for the role. This transition represents the depth of our leadership team and our talent strategies as we continue to leverage the power of One GPC.\nNow turning to our 2 business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an increase of $125 million or 5.9%. Comparable sales growth increased 6.0% in the second quarter versus last year. The cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with April being the strongest month followed by mid-single-digit growth in both May and June. The sales growth at Motion was broad-based again in the second quarter, with all product categories and major industries served posting positive gains from the prior year.\nDuring the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, iron and steel, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to make excellent progress with its initiatives including inside and outside sales, pricing, e-commerce, growth-focused tech and supply chain strategies, they're all helping to win profitable market share. As an example, Motion has seen a nearly twofold increase in average daily sales across its e-commerce platform since 2021, which now represent nearly 30% of total motion daily sales.\nIn Asia Pac, our Motion business also delivered strong performance in the second quarter with double-digit sales and profit growth. Customer-centric initiatives across talent and culture, inventory availability and operational excellence are delivering positive results.\nIndustrial segment profit in the second quarter was $283 million or 12.5% of sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in Industrial was driven by excellent operating rigor in both North America and Australasia and the disciplined execution of strategic initiatives. In addition, the Motion North America team continues to realize synergies related to the KDG acquisition. The team is substantially complete with the branch consolidation and merger efforts well ahead of initial plans. And we expect to exceed our 3-year $50 million synergy commitment by the end of this year, also well ahead of initial plans.\nTurning to Global Automotive. Total sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.4% versus the same period in 2022. Similar to the first quarter, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the U.S. posted mid-single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased 4.3%, ranging from low single-digit growth in the U.S. to low double-digit growth in Europe. We saw global automotive sales inflation moderate from high single-digit growth in the first quarter to low to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable fundamentals and solid team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth.\nGlobal Automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $329 million, up 2.1% versus the same period in 2022. And segment operating margin was 9.0% compared to 9.3% in 2022. As expected, Automotive's margin showed an improvement versus the first quarter. The improvement in the second quarter reflects the impact of the cost actions implemented at U.S. Automotive, and we expect to see an increased benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.\nNow let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 2% with comparable sales growth up 1% for the second quarter. April and May were the stronger months while trends lagged in June, particularly as we headed into the July 4 holiday weekend. That said, we're encouraged by the early trends thus far in July. Growth was relatively consistent across our regions with the East and West regions recovering in the second quarter after the slow start to the year due to the impact from weather. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling, exhaust and ride control with strength in various core categories such as filters, batteries and fluids, all of which had growth above the U.S. average. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increases across most customer segments with fleet and government outperforming again this quarter with high single-digit growth.\nIn Canada, sales grew approximately 6% in local currency during the second quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like heating and cooling, paint and body and tools and equipment, all of which were up double digits. Our automotive and heavy-duty businesses performed well, both posting mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our Canadian team executed well in the quarter, especially given the destructive wildfires across the country and we continue to see attractive opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals and share gain initiatives.\nIn Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 15% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. We continue to drive strong growth and market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our key initiatives. For the second quarter, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. As our teams continue to win business with key accounts drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. The team is on track to deliver EUR 400 million in sales of NAPA-branded products in 2023. In addition, we continue to strategically roll out our next Drive offering across our European markets that position our team to lead the industry in the growing EV aftermarket. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in Europe are tracking ahead of growth and synergy plans as we leverage our scale, integrate with discipline and expand margins. For example, comparable growth in our Iberian markets was approximately 25% during the second quarter, significantly ahead of our initial expectations.\nIn the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 9% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with retail outpacing commercial in the second quarter. The team continues to strategically invest in the business to extend its customer value proposition. For example, the recent opening of distribution centers in Auckland, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia will drive long-term profitable growth and productivity. We complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. We completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership positions and create long-term value.\nIn closing, the global GPC team delivered strong second quarter results, and we remain confident in our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. Our company is benefiting from our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Our teams remain focused to execute our strategic initiatives that deliver customer solutions and create value. We're committed to investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain and emerging technology that will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and excellent performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. our teams continue to operate at a high level and perform through this dynamic environment. And I'm pleased to walk you through the highlights of our second quarter performance.\nBefore I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the second quarter and 6 months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the sale of S.P. Richards Real Estate and the integration of KDG which represented a net $59 million benefit or $0.42 per diluted share. GPC revenues increased 5.6% or $313 million to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reflects a 4.9% improvement in comparable sales, including low single-digit to mid-single-digit levels of inflation and a 1.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 0.9% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The value and advantage of our balanced portfolio and global diversification was highlighted again as we delivered another quarterly sales record.\nOur gross margin was 36.1%, a 110 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year. Driven by the ongoing favorable impact of our pricing and sourcing initiatives. We believe the execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin will continue to drive strong results. And for the full year, we now expect our gross margin rate to improve 30 to 50 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement year-over-year.\nOur total operating and nonoperating expenses in the second quarter were $1.7 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and at 28.4% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.6% of sales in the second quarter last year or approximately 80 basis points of deleverage year-over-year. The deleverage in SG&A in the second quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, 2 of which were planned, our investments in wages and benefits for our teams and increased spending in technology.\nOur investments in the IT and digital initiatives we showcased at Investor Day, impacted SG&A by 20 basis points in the second quarter. In addition, planned investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by 30 basis points, much of this as a feat of inflationary pressure on wages. Finally, during the quarter, we recorded charges related to cost improvement actions at our U.S. automotive business and a true-up of stock compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees totaling 30 basis points, both of which we would not expect to repeat in the future.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points, driven by investments in our team members and IT. Our second quarter growth and gross margin improvement drove total segment profit of $613 million, up 11.8%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While we delivered strong overall margin expansion, margins in our Global Automotive segment were lower in Q2 due to pressure in our U.S. Automotive business. As we discussed in the first quarter, following the slow start to the year, we anticipated that the profitability of this business would remain challenged in the second quarter, and it did. However, our teams are making great progress as evidenced by the acceleration in the rate of gross margin expansion from the first quarter to the second quarter and the sequential improvement in segment margins.\nAs Will mentioned earlier, we are executing cost improvement actions to address the elevated levels of operating costs in this business and to continue to improve profitability. We expect these actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business, and execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our second quarter net income was $344 million or $2.44 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 10.9%. This represents our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth and is a true testament to our team's hard work and continued focus to drive our profitability.\nTurning to our cash flows. We generated $457 million in cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2023. Recall that our cash flow in 2022 included a sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow was $252 million, and we closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\nWe remain well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities across GPC. Our key priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. And includes investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring 2023, we have invested $205 million in capital expenditures, including $117 million in the second quarter. These investments continue to support the initiatives we believe will drive growth and the modernization of our business moving forward. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, and we invested $106 million year-to-date for acquisitions, and we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses.\nThus far in 2023, we have also returned $395 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $260 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $135 million in cash used to repurchase 841,000 shares. As we enter the second half of 2023, we are well positioned to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles.\nTurning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 20. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $9.15 and to $9.30, an increase of approximately 10% to 11.5% from 2022. This represents a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance of $8.95 to $9.10.\nOur sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with 4% to 6% comparable sales increase, and we continue to expect sales growth to moderate in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half of the year.\nTurning to a few other items of interest. Our guidance includes cash from operations in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others.\nOverall, we are very pleased with our first half results. Through this dynamic environment, our teams have demonstrated their ability to be agile while staying focused on serving our customers around the world. Our updated outlook for 2023 earnings per share reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and their ability to execute and drive solid results. We believe GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition.\nWe look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Paul for a few closing thoughts before we address your questions. Paul?\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Genuine Parts Co.\n\nThank you, Bert. Before we get into Q&A, we'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Sid Jones, who has announced his decision to retire from Genuine Parts of the company after 33 years of service to the company. Sid has been leading our Investor Relations team since 2003 and today marks his 83rd quarterly earnings call at GPC in that role. We thank for his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the very best in his retirement. Tim Walsh has been working closely with Sid and the team for over a year and will be named Head of Investor Relations on August 1. We look forward to having Tim in his new role and know he will do an exceptional job for us. So with that, we are now ready for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Donahue\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Genuine Parts Co.\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We were pleased with the continued strength and momentum in our businesses and to report results that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Before I share my comments on the first quarter, I want to share a few thoughts from our 2023 Investor Day, which we hosted just this past month. We use this event to convey our confidence in the bright future of Genuine Parts Company and update everyone on our strategy and the many opportunities we see for long-term profitable growth.\nDuring the course of the day, we highlighted our rich history, ongoing transformation and strategic priorities, which we showcased through several key initiatives in an interactive expo. Our panel discussion with our global business unit leaders, allowed us to share specific business and market opportunities and provide insights to the collaboration among our leaders and synergies across the businesses.\nFinally, we provided 3-year financial targets, including a compelling outlook for double-digit EPS CAGR and a double-digit EBITDA and segment profit margin by 2025. It was a great day for the GPC leadership team and hopefully, an informative and productive day for all of our attendees and everyone in the financial community more broadly.\nIf you missed it, we invite you to view the full presentation on our Investor Relations website. So now let's turn to the first quarter. We are proud of the outstanding work by our global GPC teammates, with sales and earnings coming in ahead of our expectations. Our first quarter performance was a clear example of how our strategic transformation to a global automotive and industrial company, is a competitive advantage that distinguishes GPC in the marketplace.\nWe benefited from our business mix and the geographic diversity of our operations with continued strong performances in our international Automotive businesses and in the Industrial segment. A few highlights in the quarter include: record quarterly sales of $5.8 billion, up 9% from the prior year. Segment margin of 9.1%, up 50 basis points from 2022.\nEarnings per share of $2.14, up 15% from adjusted EPS last year and our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we strengthened our balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation.\nThe global GPC team is focused on driving accelerated sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow through dynamic economic conditions. Across our businesses, our teammates are aligned and executing on our strategic plan to deliver outstanding customer service and continued market share gains. In Industrial, demand trends held strong throughout the first quarter with new and existing customer activity and reshoring trends each presenting growth opportunities.\nWe believe our continued momentum in industrial is due to the diversity of our product and service offerings and end markets, which all performed well again this quarter. Our acquisition of KDG and enhanced capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance are proving to be competitive differentiators, and we remain bullish on this business in the near term. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the geographic diversity of our markets, which helped to offset the headwinds of a warmer winter and volatile weather conditions in our U.S. Automotive business in Q1.\nIn addition, the automotive aftermarket is benefiting from trends such as the ongoing increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and rising interest rates and continued high prices for new and used vehicles. These are all key drivers to ongoing growth in demand, especially for the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our global automotive sales. So after delivering back-to-back record years, we are pleased with the solid start to 2023, and we continue to expect another strong year of profitable growth.\nLooking ahead, we are confident that GPC is well positioned with the right strategic plans, strong fundamentals, and rock-solid balance sheet to pursue accretive organic and acquisitive investment opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammate for taking great care of our customers around the world. So now I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team for the strong start to the year. We appreciate all your hard work to take care of our customers every day. As Paul referenced earlier, the pride in our business was on display at our Investor Day last month. We were excited to share our vision, unique advantages, market opportunities and how we're winning as we execute strategic initiatives. Our initiatives are focused on talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy.\nAs we shared during the sessions, our team is well positioned with leadership positions in attractive, fragmented markets with established customer relationships, global supplier partnerships, technical expertise and a scaled global infrastructure. We work together with shared values as 1 GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value.\nTurning our attention to the first quarter performance in our 2 business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial segment were $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $240 million or 11.9%. Comparable sales growth increased approximately 12.1% in the first quarter versus last year.\nThis marks Motion's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, January and February were the strongest 2 months on a 1-year basis, but on a 2-year basis, sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. In March 2023, Motion eclipsed the previous monthly sales and profit record set in March of 2022.\nThe sales growth at Motion continues to be broad-based with double-digit growth across most product categories and major industries serve. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to see solid performance with its corporate account initiatives, as sales with these customers grew approximately 20% in the first quarter.\nThe corporate account strength is driven from not only new customers but also strategic renewals of existing relationships. In Asia Pac, our Motion business continues to build on its momentum posting sales and profit growth well over 20% for the quarter. We realigned the leadership of the industrial business in Asia Pac by organizing under 1 automotive and industrial leadership team in the fall of 2022.\nThe team has made impressive progress to identify opportunities take action and deliver performance. Industrial segment profit in the first quarter was approximately $262 million or 11.6% of sales, representing a 230 basis point increase from the same period last year. The continued profit improvement for this segment reflects excellent operating discipline on strong sales growth, both in North America and Asia Pac. In addition, the team in North America continues to build on the synergies from the KDG acquisition last year.\nAs we reported at our Investor Day, thanks to the incredible teamwork for [many], Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in the first year, and we expect to achieve our target over $50 million in total synergies by the end of this year 1 year earlier than our initial expectation. For the quarter, Global Industrial represented $0.50 of total GPC segment profit.\nTurning to the Global Automotive segment. Total sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately $230 million or 7% versus the same period in 2022. Total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the U.S. posted high single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency during the first quarter.\nFrom a cadence perspective, through the quarter, global automotive sales were strongest in February and March. On a comparable basis, Global Automotive sales increased approximately 7% and with comps ranging from low single digits in the United States to low double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pac. As Paul mentioned, we remain encouraged by the solid industry fundamentals and team execution which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth.\nGlobal Automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $264 million, essentially flat with last year and segment operating margin was 7.5% compared to 8.1% in 2022. The strong performance of our European, Canadian and Asia Pac businesses helped to partially offset lower margins in our U.S. Automotive business. Profit in the U.S. Automotive business was impacted by a sluggish start to the year on sales, combined with planned investments in wages and elevated freight out expense. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography.\nIn the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 4% during the quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. The first quarter represents the toughest year-over-year comparison of 2023 with an approximate 12% comp growth in the first quarter of 2022. Looking at our average daily sales, growth was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. However, milder winter temperatures combined with extreme weather events impacted automotive demand in certain product categories and periodically disrupted operations.\nAs examples, sales of batteries were positive, but below internal plans during the quarter, particularly in the Northeast. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling and UnderCar with strength in various core categories such as filters, brakes and fluids, all of which had growth above the U.S. average. Growth was consistent across our regions, except for our West region, which experienced a more pronounced negative impact from weather, which temporarily disrupted many of our operations.\nOverall, we estimate that weather negatively impacted U.S. automotive sales by approximately 1% in the quarter. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with mid-single-digit commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increase across all customer segments, including continued strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare network.\nThe sales performance at U.S. Automotive started the year slow relative to our expectations. As a result, the team acted during March to address cost while balancing its longer-term investment priorities. The benefits of the actions will be weighted towards the second half of the year. Sales have improved during the first half of April when compared to March and the team remains focused on delivering in '23 despite the soft start to the year.\nIn Canada, sales grew approximately 9% in local currency during the first quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like brakes, chassis and filtration, all of which were up double digits in the first quarter. In addition, we saw strong performance in our heavy-duty business, which outperformed the total Canadian growth rate. These categories helped offset headwinds in certain weather-related categories like batteries, which were pressured by a milder winter season.\nWe're pleased with the strong quarter in Canada, and we continue to see compelling opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals, share gain initiatives and strong team execution. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 13%.\nThe strong growth in market share gains across Europe continue to be driven by solid execution of key initiatives. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies as our teams continue to win new business with key accounts drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region.\nWe're on track to grow our NAPA branded sales from EUR 300 million in 2022 to approximately EUR 400 million in 2023. Our entry into Spain and Portugal in 2022 has exceeded our expectations and value creation plans as it benefits from the NAPA brand and European scale advantage. In addition, our team is expanding our NexDrive EV service shops to approximately 400 locations, up from 150 shops in 2022.\nWe believe our NexDrive offering will position the European team to lead our industry in the growing EV aftermarket. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased approximately 14% in local currency from the same period in the prior year, with comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with both growing at a double-digit rate in the first quarter.\nIn addition, March saw record sales and profit results across several go-to-market channels, including Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories. Asia Pac continued to make impressive progress on its talent and culture and customer-centric growth initiatives. We continue to complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value.\nDuring the first quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership and create long-term value. In summary, the global GPC team delivered strong first quarter results, and we remain confident in the outlook for the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment.\nWe will execute our near and long-term initiatives and focus on what we can control. Our investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain and emerging tech will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and performance.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nPresident, FedEx Express Europe & Chief Executive Officer, TNT, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams as they continue to navigate a dynamic environment, and I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights of our first quarter performance. Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the first quarter of 2023. However, our comparisons to the prior year do exclude certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG.\nTotal GPC sales increased 8.9% or $470 million to $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This reflects an 8.7% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and a 2.4% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 2.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Overall, our balanced portfolio and global diversification drove record total sales and strong earnings to start the year.\nOur gross margin was 34.9% in the first quarter, improving 30 basis points from our adjusted gross margin last year, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives. The favorable impact of these and other initiatives contributed approximately 60 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by 2 key headwinds. First, a shift in sales mix related to the strength of our industrial business, which impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points; and second, foreign currency, which also impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points.\nAs we highlighted at Investor Day, our ongoing execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin continue to drive strong results. Our total operating and nonoperating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and in line with the prior year at 27.9% of sales. The increase in expenses in Q1 reflects the combination of solid discipline in managing core costs, offset by planned investments in our teams due to inflationary wage conditions and increased spending in technology to support our ongoing strategic initiatives. As Will noted, with elevated operating costs pressuring margins in the first quarter in our U.S. automotive business, we have taken actions in March to address these headwinds, which we anticipate to persist into Q2.\nWe expect these cost actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business and the execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our performance in the first quarter generated total segment profit of $526 million, up 16% and a segment profit margin of 9.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of segment margin expansion. Our first quarter net income was $304 million or $2.14 per diluted share.\nThis compares to adjusted net income of $266 million or $1.86 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 15%. Our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth is indicative of the hard work and crisp execution by our teams to implement our strategic initiatives across our global operations. Turning to our cash flows.\nWe generated $198 million in cash from operations in the first quarter. This compares to $399 million in cash from operations last year, which included the sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. Free cash flow was $109 million, and we closed the first quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\nWe are well positioned with financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities that may become available across the business. We remain committed to our long history of disciplined capital allocation. Our 4 key priorities for capital allocation are unchanged and include investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nIn the first quarter, we invested $88 million in capital expenditures, primarily around supply chain and technology. These investments support many of the initiatives we shared at Investor Day that we believe will drive the modernization of our business moving forward. We also invested $40 million for acquisitions which remains a key element of our growth strategy. As Will mentioned earlier, we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses.\nFor the quarter, we returned $194 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $126 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $68 million of cash used to repurchase 411,000 shares. We are well positioned with the cash flow to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles.\nTurning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 23 and reaffirmed on March 23 at our Investor Day. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.95 to $9.10, an increase of approximately 7% to 9% from 2022.\nThis represents a $0.15 increase from our previous guidance of $8.80 to $8.95. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with comparable sales increase.\nAnd with the ongoing assumption of stronger first half year-over-year sales growth relative to the second half of 2023, and although our view on Q2 and Q3 has improved modestly. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are raising our outlook for cash from operations to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion previously. We are raising our outlook for free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of $800 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year and positive momentum in our business. While our U.S. Automotive business had a slow start to the year, we've started Q2 with good sales momentum and expect our team to execute, build traction through the second quarter and have a solid second half of 2023. Our outlook for the full year reflects the ongoing confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute through the dynamic economic environment.\nGPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. As we shared at Investor Day, our team is well positioned to execute our plans to deliver our targets for a double-digit EPS CAGR over the next 3 years and double-digit margins by 2025. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease note, today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSidney G. Jones\n\nSVP of IR, Genuine Parts Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company's website. Please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted on the Investors page of our website. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report the GPC team capped off a record-setting year with a strong fourth quarter, highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with continued margin expansion. We are incredibly proud of the progress in our operations and thankful to our teammates across the globe for their ongoing commitment to excellence. With the support of strong industry fundamentals and resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses, our teams were focused on executing key initiatives to drive sales growth faster than the market, improved gross margin and enhance operational efficiencies. As a result, we delivered in several key areas in the fourth quarter and full year.\nA few highlights in the fourth quarter would include total sales of $5.5 billion, up 15%, and our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Segment margin of 9.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $2.05, up 15% from 2021, and our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. For the full year, our strong quarterly performance drove record total sales of $22.1 billion, up 17%, which follows a 14% increase in 2021. Segment margin of 9.4%, up 60 basis points from 2021. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.34, up 21% from the prior year and a new GPC record and strong cash flow with cash from operations up 17% and free cash flow up 14% from 2021 levels.\nReflecting on the record year, which followed an outstanding 2021, we are confident that our transformation efforts, including the streamlining of our businesses to an automotive and industrial-centric business along with our ongoing strategic initiatives, has been highly successful. Throughout 2022, our teams navigated the dynamics of the macro economy and have continued to deliver market share gains while delivering positive momentum across our core businesses. We continue to make significant investments in talent and technology to maximize the impact of our key initiatives. As an example, we made solid progress to advance our pricing strategies and optimize our supply chain and network footprint. Our execution in the field has proven effective in driving core improvement in gross margin and SG&A as well as parts availability, all of which provide additional opportunities for us in the future.\nAs we build on the competitive advantages of our size and scale, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our product and service offerings and expand our automotive and industrial footprint. As you will hear from Will, last year's acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group has been transformational for our Industrial segment. KDG had a significant impact on our industrial performance in 2022 and has elevated our capabilities as a premier industrial solutions provider. Our global automotive teams were also active with acquisitions, including geographic expansion in Europe with the addition of operations in both Spain and Portugal.\nFor the year, we added 138 net new stores across our global footprint with the U.S. and Europe leading the way. Looking ahead, we have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets and M&A remains an important element of our global growth strategy. As we turn our attention to 2023, while the macro environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our strategic plans to drive ongoing market share gains with sustained sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow. Looking at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive business is benefiting from several tailwinds, including the geographic diversity of our markets, the increase in vehicle miles driven, an aging vehicle fleet and limited new car inventory. These tailwinds are driving steady levels of demand in the aftermarket with particular strength in the DIFM segment.\nIn Industrial, we continue to see solid demand trends with new and existing customer activity and reshoring trends, each presenting growth opportunities. We believe the strong performance in our Industrial business reflects the diversity of our product and service offerings as well as our end markets, which all performed well in the fourth quarter. In addition, as you'll hear from Will, our growing capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance are proving to be differentiators for our business. Collectively, we believe these strong fundamentals combined with a rock solid balance sheet, position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities through both organic and acquisitive investments while also returning capital to shareholders.\nSo before I close, I'd like to remind our investor community that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day on Thursday, March 23, here at our headquarters in Atlanta. We will be sharing more about our strategic initiatives and provide an update to our long-term financial targets. We look forward to hosting this event next month, and hope to see you all here in Atlanta. We had an exceptional 2022, which included celebrating our 95th year of operations. Our accomplishments as One GPC team are evident in this milestone year, and we are proud to lead a company with such a long and rich history that differentiates GPC across all of our marketplaces.\nSo now I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident & COO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC team for an exceptional year in 2022 and the hard work to take care of our customers every day. Around the world, our teams are aligned on our strategic initiative pillars that include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging tech. Investment and focus in these areas translate into a better customer experience, profitable growth, operational excellence and a differentiated team culture. During 2022, all of our teams made significant initiative progress, and we look forward to sharing more details about our progress and outlook at our upcoming Investor Day in March.\nTurning our attention to the fourth quarter performance. Total sales for the Global Automotive segment were $3.4 billion, an increase of approximately $243 million or 7.6% versus the same period in 2021. Our sales growth was consistent through the quarter with a solid finish in December to close the year. On a comparable basis, automotive sales growth for the quarter increased 8.2%. Our Global Automotive teams delivered mid-single digit to low double-digit comp growth across each of our operations. As Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and team execution. For fiscal year 2022, Global Automotive segment sales were $13.7 billion, an increase of 8.9% from 2021. Global Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $295 million, and segment operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the same period in 2021.\nFor the year, Global Automotive segment profit was $1.2 billion, and segment operating margin was 8.7%, an increase of 10 basis points from 2021 and up 110 basis points from 2019. During the fourth quarter, our automotive business experienced mid- to high single-digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second and third quarters. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management strategic initiatives.\nNow let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 10% during the fourth quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Sales were strong across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with batteries, motor oils, tools and equipment, heavy-duty and brakes, all posting strong growth in the quarter. The team navigated various extreme weather events in December and kept teammates safe while taking care of customers. Sales of both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low single-digit growth.\nOur commercial business saw sales growth across all customer segments, including notable strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare network. Over the course of the year, we grew our NAPA AutoCare network of professional repair centers to a record 18,500 customers, an increase of 670 locations and further expanded our competitive advantage as America's largest network of parts and care. We also continue our investment in the industry as we trained over 34,000 technicians in 2022 and actively support 900 technicians in our apprenticeship program. Other select accomplishments in 2022 include investments in talent and enhancements to our data analytics and technology capabilities.\nThese enhancements have improved our insights and are driving data-driven decisions around strategic pricing and sourcing, which has nicely contributed to margin expansion performance. We've also improved our inventory visibility and are taking action to ensure the right part is in the right place at the right time. We will continue to invest in these capabilities as we move forward. For the full year, our U.S. Automotive business grew sales by approximately 11% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. We're extremely pleased with the share gains and record results in 2022.\nIn Canada, sales grew approximately 14% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 12%. The results in Canada continue to reflect solid industry fundamentals, strong team execution and market share gains. Our field-oriented data analytics to assess and prioritize market, customer and network opportunities has delivered returns. In partnership with global teams, the Canadian business also made progress with NexDrive, powered by NAPA, our leading offering that positions repair shops to service hybrid and electric vehicles. In a short period of time, the program has certified over 50 EV technicians, parts specialists and service advisers with plans to have 100 certified service centers and nearly 400 trained parts specialists over the next few years. For the year, our Canadian business grew sales approximately 15% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 13%.\nIn Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales increasing approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 10%. For the year, our European team delivered sales growth of 19% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. The strong growth in Europe continues to be driven by solid execution and coordinated teamwork across Europe. As examples, during 2022, our European team won business with numerous key customer accounts and continue to gain market share with the rollout of our differentiated NAPA offering across the region. Sales of NAPA product in Europe reached nearly EUR 300 million, an annual increase of over 50% from the prior year and now positively contribute to profitability.\nThe impressive growth is a testament to the global strength of the NAPA brand. The NexDrive rollout is also strong in Europe with approximately 150 certified workshops across 7 countries. In addition, our European bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and expand and add density to our market footprint. Despite a challenging environment, the performance over the last few years has been strong in Europe and the momentum has continued to start 2023.\nIn the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 10% in local currency from the same period in the prior year with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. For the year, our Australian team delivered sales growth of 12% and comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division delivering profitable growth and share gains. The team continued its impressive performance in 2022 with a 3-year sales stack of more than 30%. Repco's 100-year anniversary in 2022 marked an amazing achievement for this team, and it was only fitting that the team delivered another outstanding year.\nTurning to the Global Industrial segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $478 million or 29.6%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter with average daily sales growth at or above 30% for all 3 months of the quarter. Comparable sales growth, which excludes the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 17% in the fourth quarter versus last year. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of KDG in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, going forward, KDG sales growth will be included in comparable sales growth.\nThe strong sales growth at Motion during the quarter was broad-based with double-digit growth across nearly all product categories and major industries served with particular strength coming from industries such as automotive, oil and gas, fluid power and aggregate and cement. For the year, sales at Motion were $8.4 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 33.2%. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $230 million or 11% of sales, representing a 150 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement at Motion is a result of strong and disciplined sales growth and operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization.\nFor the year, Global Industrial segment profit was approximately $887 million, and segment operating margin was a record 10.5%, an increase of 110 basis points from 2021 and up 240 basis points from 2019. In 2022, the Industrial segment now represents over 40% of GPC total profit, up 8 percentage points since 2021. For the fourth quarter, inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range, consistent with the levels we've seen throughout the year. The strong financial performance at Motion is a direct result of their customer and sales intensity, focused strategic initiatives and operating rigor. During the year, we enhanced our selling capabilities by further leveraging data and technology and continue to expand our value-added solutions offering for our customers. These solutions include products and services in categories like automation, conveyance, fluid power and repair. These categories now collectively represent approximately $1 billion in annual revenue promotion.\nIn addition, our strategic initiatives around pricing, category management and supply chain are driving increased productivity and profitability, which is reflected in the strong margin expansion delivered in 2022. As we execute on our organic global growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. We also continue to make progress in integrating our strategic acquisition of KDG with Motion. When we announced this acquisition in January of 2022, we communicated a plan for approximately $50 million in annual run rate synergies to be achieved over a 3-year period. We're pleased to report that thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in just the first year with more expected in 2023 and 2024.\nOur acquisition pipeline is active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value.\nIn summary, our team delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and record year for Genuine Parts Company. All our business units and geographies exceeded internal expectations, driven by supportive industry fundamentals and the focused execution of our key strategic initiatives. We're excited to build on our momentum, and we look forward to another great year in 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams and our outstanding performance, and I'm pleased to share the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results. My comments this morning focus primarily on quarterly and full year adjusted results, which exclude nonrecurring items that I'll cover in more detail shortly. Total GPC sales were up 15% or $720 million to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects an 11.1% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and an 8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was essentially in line with our assumption for the quarter. Sales for the full year were $22.1 billion, up 17.1% from 2021.\nAs we continue to invest in organic and acquisitive growth initiatives for both of our segments, it was encouraging to see our core business combined with acquisitions, including KDG, which added more than $1 billion in revenues for 2022 drive strong sales throughout the year. Our gross margin expanded approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 35.7%, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives that Will mentioned. These initiatives, along with others, contributed approximately 160 basis points of core gross margin improvement.\nThese gains were partially offset by a few key factors: first, moderating year-over-year supplier incentives pressured gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; second, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial business impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; finally, foreign currency and inflation impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. With a strong fourth quarter, gross margin for the full year was 35.1%, slightly above our expectations and essentially in line with the prior year. Our performance on gross margin reflects an excellent job by our team executing our strategies given the very dynamic market challenges.\nOur total operating and nonoperating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding adjustments, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 16.6% from 2021 and at 28.7% of sales compared to 28.3% of sales in the prior year. Our expenses were up in the quarter, primarily due to inflation-driven increases in freight costs and overall investments in IT initiatives across our business units. For the year, total expenses were $6.2 billion, up 16.2% at a 27.9% of sales, a 20 basis point improvement from 2021. Despite ongoing cost pressures in the fourth quarter, we continue to drive leverage on strong core sales growth across our businesses and execute on our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies. Segment profit in the fourth quarter was $526 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 9.5%, an impressive 80 basis point increase from the same period in 2021.\nFor the full year, segment profit was $2.1 billion, up 25% on a 17% sales increase. Our segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year and up 160 basis points from 2019, which we believe demonstrates our transformation to an even stronger company and our ability to consistently perform through dynamic economic conditions. As outlined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter results include 3 adjustments. The first item relates to a $29 million adjustment to remeasure our product liability reserve. Secondly, we incurred approximately $30 million of costs related to the acquisition and integration of KDG. The third item relates to an $11 million loss on the divestiture of our remaining minority interest investment in S.P. Richards, which was finalized in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our nonrecurring items include these fourth quarter adjustments as well as the 12-month impact of costs related to KDG and a gain on the sale of certain real estate recorded in the second quarter.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share in nonrecurring items I just discussed, was $292 million or $2.05 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $256 million or $1.79 per diluted share in 2021, an increase of 15%. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $8.34 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from 2021. The reported net income was $1.2 billion or $8.31 per diluted share. The continued execution of our initiatives allowed us to deliver back-to-back double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 and 2021.\nWith strong earnings growth and improved working capital, we generated $222 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year, a 17% increase from 2021. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up 14% from 2021, and we closed the fourth quarter and year with $2.2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x, which compares to our target range of 2 to 2.5x and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. Our strong performance has allowed us to stay focused on 4 key priorities for capital allocation, including the reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nFor the year, we invested $340 million in capital expenditures, including $96 million in the fourth quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We also invested $1.5 billion for acquisitions, including the $1.3 billion investment in KDG and returned $719 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $496 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $223 million in cash used to repurchase 1.6 million shares. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles.\nTurning to our outlook for 2023. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $8.95, which represents an increase of 6% to 7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022. Our outlook for earnings growth is driven by our expectations for continuous sales growth and another year of margin expansion. We expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. As we look at the business segments, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% increase in comparable sales.\nWe would add that our outlook for Industrial assumes a much stronger first half relative to the third and fourth quarters of 2023.\nTurning to a few other items of interest. We will continue to drive growth through the reinvestment in our business and M&A. We currently expect CapEx to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million in 2023, reflecting incremental opportunities in technology and supply chain, among others. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and we'll continue to seek additional bolt-on acquisitions wherever they create value for us. In 2023, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.80 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing our 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 6% increase from the $3.58 per share paid in 2022 and is above our 20-year average increase of 5.8%.\nOur total shareholder return performance of approximately 27% in 2022 placed GPC in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Taken together, we delivered sales growth of 17% and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, so a tremendous year in 2022. Our teams worked hard for these achievements, and we enter 2023 with strong momentum and are well positioned to continue to take share and deliver through an uncertain macro environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year.\nIn closing, as both Paul and Will have mentioned, we look forward to hosting our Investor Day on March 23. We are excited to provide further insights on key growth initiatives and long-term financial targets and are confident you will find the day informative and productive. We'd love to see you here in Atlanta.\nThank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call will be recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSidney G. Jones\n\nSVP of IR, Genuine Parts Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted on the Investor page of our website.\nToday's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.\nNow I'll turn it over to Paul for his remarks.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Before diving into the details of the quarter, we want to say that our hearts go out to our teammates, suppliers, customers and all those affected by the devastating impact of Hurricane Ian in late September. GPC is committed to providing care and support through our GPC Relief Fund and our partners at the American Red Cross.\nSo now turning to the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our results for 2022, and we are proud of the great work by all of our 53,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. Our team delivered record results with double-digit sales and earnings growth, driven by the execution of effective strategies and continued resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses.\nLet's review several of our Q3 highlights. Total sales of $5.7 billion, up 18% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.23, up 19% from last year; record quarterly sales for the automotive and industrial segments and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth; operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall; record quarterly earnings and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth; the ongoing integration of KDG which continues to create significant value; and finally, continued strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet.\nOur teams are executing on key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive ongoing momentum in our top and bottom line results. We remain agile in navigating a dynamic operating environment created by inflation and economic conditions, the geopolitical landscape and supply chain challenges. We continue to benefit from the competitive advantages of our size and scale, and we remain focused on advancing our technology to optimize inventory availability, enhance network productivity and maximize the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. We are making significant progress in our operations through our efforts in all these areas, as evident in the expansion of operating margins again in the third quarter.\nOur automotive and industrial businesses continue to take advantage of several industry tailwinds. In automotive, the increase in year-to-date miles driven, an aging car park, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are all supportive of healthy demand in the aftermarket. In industrial, the manufacture and economy remains expansionary, with PMI holding at greater than 50%, while industrial production just had its ninth straight quarter of growth up 2.9% year-over-year. Our teams continue to operate well in a challenging environment. And as we wind down the year, we remain focused on driving our strategic initiatives across all of our global operations.\nThis past quarter, we spent considerable time in the field visiting stores and branches, meeting with many of our strategic suppliers and customers, and we came away encouraged by the general outlook for continued growth in the automotive aftermarket and industrial space. In addition, during the quarter, our global leadership team met to review our near-term initiatives and collaborate on our long-term strategic road map. Our teams are well aligned, and we are confident in our strategic plans to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth and margin expansion. Our strong cash flow generation and exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments in both organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.\nSo before I pass the call over to Will, we'd like to highlight our 2022 sustainability report which we published earlier this month. The new report advances GPC's long-term sustainability strategy and expands our reporting and disclosure to reflect the extent of our global operations. We do this through a focus on 3 key areas, including improving diversity, equity and inclusion, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing ESG governance.\nTwo highlights from the report include: the completion of our 2022 employee engagement survey, where we had significant participation across our global teams and received an 80% global engagement score. And secondly, the calculation and disclosure of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and plans for greenhouse gas reduction programs across our global operations.\nWe believe that our 2022 sustainability report illustrates GPC's strong ESG strategy and a way forward that underscores our commitment to keeping the world moving. We encourage you to visit the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress in this important area.\nSo again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering on another great quarter of record results.\nSo now I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the collective focus and hard work to deliver great results around the world.\nDuring the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by solid team execution and disciplined focus on strategic initiatives, which are aligned around our 5 foundational priorities, talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology.\nTurning to the performance by segment. Total sales for Global Automotive were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $285 million or 8.9% versus the same period last year. Our sales performance was relatively consistent in all 3 months of the quarter, and on a comparable basis, sales growth for the quarter increased 9.2%. Our global teams delivered mid-single digit to mid-teens comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and strong team execution.\nGlobal Automotive segment profit was $309 million, and segment operating margin was 8.9%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the same period last year. This performance reflects strong sales growth and operating expense leverage.\nDuring the third quarter, our automotive business experienced high single-digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second quarter. The pricing environment remains rational, and we're pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our strategic category management initiatives. We expect sales inflation in the fourth quarter to be largely consistent with the third quarter.\nNow let's turn to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories, with brakes, filters, fluids and batteries all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth within the majority of our categories.\nSales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low to mid-single-digit growth. Our commercial business saw broad-based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with high single-digit sales growth during the third quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience.\nU.S. automotive initiatives are advancing well with continued progress in talent, technology investments, customer segmentation, analytics, pricing capabilities and emerging tech. During the quarter, the U.S. Automotive team formally realigned team resources to establish a centralized project management office to coordinate and drive impact of its business initiative portfolio.\nAs an example of emerging tech effort, the U.S. Automotive team hosted its first ever EV Day in Atlanta, which included teammates and representatives from various strategic emerging tech partners. We use this opportunity to update internal teammates and collaborate with our electric vehicle and emerging technology suppliers. In addition, as another example of our emerging tech focus, Motion recently established a new electric vehicle battery customer segment based on increasing opportunities presented by the build-out of new battery manufacturing facilities across North America. We continue to build momentum with our EV efforts as we leverage our global footprint, business mix and scale to extend our emerging tech leadership position.\nIn Canada, sales grew approximately 15% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales growth of 13%. The strong results in Canada are reflective of solid industry fundamentals, team execution and market share gains. As examples of sales effectiveness and data and technology initiatives, Canada continues to improve the customer experience and simplify its business processes with advanced analytics and business intelligence tools. This micro market visibility has increased wallet share and identified growth opportunities as the team executes both organic and inorganic growth initiatives.\nIn Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales increasing approximately 20% in local currency and comparable sales up 7%. Growth in Europe is a result of the continued focus on its strategic initiatives, including growth with key customer accounts, the rollout of the NAPA brand across the region and investments in our people, technology and supply chain capabilities.\nIn addition, our bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and add to our local market coverage. Our recent acquisitions in Germany, Spain and Portugal are tracking well with integration plans and the performance and synergy capture has exceeded our internal expectations. Overall, we believe our European strategies have resulted in solid market share gains.\nIn the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 16% in local currency from last year with comparable sales growth of 14%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division all delivering strong profitable growth. Next month, our Australian and New Zealand team will celebrate Repco's 100-year anniversary, which is a testament to the power of the brand, differentiated customer value proposition and Repco's position as the leading automotive aftermarket business in the market. Congratulations to our teammates down under on achieving this incredible milestone.\nTurning to the Global Industrial segment. During the third quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $570 million or 35.3%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 20% versus last year. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. The growth was consistent across almost all product categories and major industries served, with particular strength coming from industries such as food, chemicals, aggregate and cement, mining and oil and gas.\nIndustrial segment profit was $243 million or 11.1% of sales, representing an 80 basis point increase from the same period last year and a new record for the Industrial segment. The improvement is a result of Motion's strong sales growth and disciplined operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the third quarter, inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range, consistent with the levels we've seen throughout the year. Key initiatives contributing to the strong performance in the Industrial business, include sales programs to capture organic profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data-driven strategic pricing and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omnichannel experience, and continued ongoing inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives.\nAs an example of footprint optimization efforts, Motion successfully executed its initial fulfillment center and branch optimization initiative in Florida, which is designed to improve the customer experience by offering next-day delivery for an order placed by 3:00 p.m. In addition to an improved customer experience, the strategy reduces duplicative inventory position, increases available product breadth, and increases the efficiency and reduces the cost of our last mile delivery logistics.\nIn addition, Motion opened 2 new strategically located facilities to grow its value-added automation services with existing and new customers. We're pleased with the initiative results, and Motion will continue to methodically roll out these strategies nationwide over time. In addition, the integration of KDG continues to exceed our expectations. The teams are executing well-defined plans with customers, suppliers and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined organization. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan, including the colocation and merging of overlapping branches, and we're excited for the continued growth opportunities at Motion.\nLastly, during the quarter, we were pleased to formally open the GPC Global Technology Center based in Kraków, Poland. As part of our strategic investments in talent and technology, the center is designed to help accelerate our technology initiatives and capability building. The technology center will serve as an integrated extension of our existing global team and will focus on areas such as digital, supply chain, data platforms, pricing and cybersecurity as a few examples. With nearly 1 million people living in Kraków and approximately 200,000 students, Kraków is a global hub for next-generation tech talent. As we move forward, we'll consider technology roles in Kraków to leverage our scale, build capabilities and deliver faster path to value for global technology initiatives.\nAs we execute our organic growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create value. During the third quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in key geographies. The M&A pipeline continues to be active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value.\nIn summary, our strong third quarter and year-to-date results are being driven by supportive industry fundamentals and our key strategic initiatives. While the macro environment remains dynamic, our teams will prioritize our customers as we analyze our market and performance indicators, remain agile, and strategically invest with discipline and initiatives that extend our global leadership position.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bert Nappier.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. As I review the key highlights for the third quarter, our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which excludes the nonrecurring costs related to the integration of KDG.\nTotal GPC sales were $5.7 billion in the third quarter, up $856 million or 17.8% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects a 12.7% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation, and a 9.1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, in line with our assumptions. Hurricane Ian did not have a material impact on our third quarter financial results.\nOur gross margin was 34.9%, a 60 basis point decrease compared to the third quarter last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 3 key factors: first, moderating supplier incentives, which pressured gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Second, foreign currency, which impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. And finally, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial segment, which impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by the positive impact of our data-driven pricing and sourcing programs where our teams continue to leverage our growing global scale. These actions and our expertise drove an 85 basis point favorable impact to gross margin in the third quarter. We currently expect our full year gross margin to be in line with our third quarter and 9-month rate.\nOur total operating and nonoperating expenses excluding nonrecurring items, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 15% from 2021 and at 27.5% of sales compared to 28% of sales the prior year. We continue to drive leverage across our businesses, and our teams remain focused on effective cost controls and executing our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies.\nWith our strong performance, segment profit was $552 million, up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.7%, a 40 basis point increase from last year and up 170 basis points from 2019. We believe the multiyear improvement in our segment margin is the result of transformation to a stronger and more agile company. Our teams have taken actions to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio of automotive and industrial segments. We have also enhanced our pricing and sourcing capabilities to ensure that we deliver profitable growth. In addition, we've generated significant cost savings over the last few years to lower our cost structure. Collectively, these actions, along with continued hard work by our teams, set the foundation for long-term strategic growth.\nOur third quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $4.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share and nonrecurring KDG integration costs was $317 million, or $2.23 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $270 million or $1.88 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 19%. This exceptional performance is a result of the crisp execution of our initiatives, which are translating to GPC, delivering accelerated growth and profitability.\nAs we turn to the balance sheet, changes in the key elements of our working capital were generally in line with our sales growth. At September 30, our total accounts receivable were up 17%, with inventory up 15%. Likewise, accounts payable increased 15% from 2021, which also correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flow with $454 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and $1.2 billion for the 9 months, up 23% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range, with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x. This compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x and highlights our financial strength and flexibility.\nThe key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these include reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&, A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $244 million in capital expenditures, including $91 million in the third quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity.\nWe have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $542 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $369 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $173 million in cash to repurchase 1.3 million shares. The continued strength of our cash flow provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles and has allowed GPC to increase our dividend for 66 consecutive years.\nTurning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance and raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.05 to $8.15, which represents an increase of 16% to 18% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.80 to $7.95. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase from 12% to 14%.\nBy business segment, we're guiding to the following: 7% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an update from 6% to 8%. This new outlook also reflects 7% to 8% comparable sales growth. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales growth outlook to 31% to 32%, an increase from our previous outlook of 26% to 28%. The new outlook includes a 15% to 16% comparable sales increase, which is up from 9% to 11%.\nWe are pleased with the positive momentum in our business in the third quarter and through the 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the continued confidence in our execution, balanced against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain macro environment. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us with full flexibility to support our growth plans through ongoing investments in the business and return of cash to our shareholders while remaining balanced and disciplined.\nWe look forward to reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our next call in February. Thank you, and we will now turn it back over to the operator for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 202 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSidney G. Jones\n\nSVP of IR, Genuine Parts Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; and Bert Nappier, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations website.\nPlease be advised, this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.\nToday's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filing, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, I'm here with Will as well as Bert, who is on his first earnings call as CFO. Welcome to the call, Bert.\nWe are pleased to report continued strong results from Genuine Parts Company in the second quarter of 2022. The GPC team had another record quarter, consisting of double-digit sales and earnings increases and a steady cadence of continued growth throughout April, May and June. Total sales were $5.6 billion, up 17%. And adjusted earnings per share was $2.20, up 26% from last year. We continue to benefit from the resiliency of our automotive and industrial businesses and the strategic mix of our operations.\nWe would like to thank our 53,000 talented GPC teammates for their exceptional work and commitment to excellence. A few highlights in the quarter include another quarterly sales record for GPC, and our Automotive and Industrial segment; segment operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall; record quarterly earnings and double-digit EPS growth for the eighth consecutive quarter; and strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet.\nWe continue to execute our key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive positive momentum in our top and bottom line results despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Our teams are doing an excellent job of navigating supply chain disruptions, enabling our business with the product we need to serve our customers and capture market share.\nFor example, we are investing in our businesses to enhance forecast accuracy for product demand, improve fill rates and optimize our network footprint. Our size and global scale continue to be an advantage as we work to have the right part in the right place at the right time. Likewise, our pricing strategies have proven valuable and substantially offsetting product inflation and rising freight costs.\nOur M&A strategy has also been effective. As you will hear from Will, the accelerated integration of KDG has been executed with a high degree of precision and has had a meaningful impact on our industrial performance. In addition, our global automotive teams have been active with ongoing strategic bolt-on acquisitions, such as the addition of Knoll, which rounds out our national footprint in Germany, the largest economy in Europe.\nWe continue to explore a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets and M&A remains an important part of our global growth strategy. Additionally, we are benefiting from ongoing initiatives such as accelerating the rollout of the NAPA brand or international markets as well as further investing in B2B and B2C omnichannel enhancements to both our catalog data and technology platforms. We also continue to upgrade our pricing and product category management strategies, to further extend our leadership positions in the global automotive and industrial markets.\nAs we look at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive and industrial business are benefiting from several tailwinds. The continued increase in miles driven and the average age of vehicles, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are supporting demand in the automotive aftermarket and driving continued strength in the DIFM segment.\nIn industrial, PMI continues to signal manufacturing expansion, and industrial production showed gains again in the second quarter, representing the eighth consecutive quarter of growth. We are closely monitoring potential consumer headwinds, including the effect of historically high inflation and its impact on gas prices, freight and wages. However, we will stay focused on our strategic initiatives and remain agile in the execution of our business on a day-to-day basis.\nThe enthusiasm and momentum in our business was on full display last week when for the first time in 7 years, we hosted our 2022 NAPA Expo in Las Vegas. This gathering brought together more than 15,000 global attendees, including NAPA AutoCare customers, independent NAPA store owners, NAPA store managers, key suppliers, and leaders across our operations. It was an extraordinary event packed with seminars, insights, business building strategies and an extensive trade show featuring our global suppliers and key business partners.\nWe took the opportunity to introduce our new NAPA brand campaign, Get Up & Go, and you could feel the positive energy and excitement for the future of NAPA and the automotive aftermarket overall. The biggest takeaway is that the NAPA team in the U.S. and across the globe is well positioned for the future.\nDuring the quarter, we also had the opportunity to spend time in the field with our Motion leadership team. We visited our operations and customers across the Midwest and saw firsthand the momentum in our industrial business and the progress of the KDG acquisition.\nAs we mentioned in our last call, we have been active in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. This has included formalizing our Carbon Emission Reduction strategy as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We look forward to providing additional details on our progress in these areas later this year as we publish our 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report.\nSo again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering another quarter of record results.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Will.\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the team effort and hard work to deliver great results around the world.\nDuring the second quarter, we built on solid momentum and delivered strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by team execution and disciplined focus on strategic initiatives. We continue to align our initiatives around 5 foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology. We'll highlight select initiative examples as we review the business performance.\nTurning to the performance details by segment. Total sales for our global Automotive segment were $3.5 billion in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $271 million or 8.5% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was relatively consistent in all 3 months of the quarter. And on a comparable basis, sales growth for the quarter was plus 8%. Our global teams delivered mid-single-digit to low double-digit comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the Automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and focused team execution.\nGlobal Automotive segment profit was $323 million, and segment operating margin was 9.3%, representing a 20-basis-point increase from the same period last year. The improvement in segment profit was driven by strong operating discipline across our operations despite a dynamic environment.\nDuring the second quarter, our automotive business experienced slightly higher product cost inflation compared to the mid-single-digit experienced in the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational, and we're pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management initiatives. Looking ahead, we believe current levels of inflation will continue through the second half of 2022.\nNow turning to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of 7%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with brakes, filters and fluids all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth with many of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which moderated to mid-single-digit growth as expected.\nOur commercial business representing approximately 80% of U.S. auto sales saw broad-based strength across all customer segments.\nDigital channels across all customers also performed well, with low double-digit sales growth during the second quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience.\nOther select U.S. initiative examples to highlight include the rollout of an enhanced PROLink, our B2B digital commerce platform, new sales and marketing programs, including the new NAPA Get Up & Go brand campaign, pricing and sourcing analytics, inventory and forecasting tools and DC productivity initiatives, to name just a few.\nIn Canada, sales grew approximately 16% in local currency during the second quarter. Comparable sales were up 14% and up 26% on a 2-year stack, reflective of the continued strength of the reopening of the Canadian market and solid team execution.\nTo highlight an example of emerging technology initiatives, during the second quarter, we officially launched NexDrive in Canada. Originally launched in Europe in 2020, NexDrive is a program that enables our network of automotive service centers to repair next-generation hybrids and EV vehicles. As part of this program, we partner with our vast service center network to offer product, training, tools and technology. We currently have over 100 NexDrive service centers in the European market, and we're excited to bring this offering to the Canadian market.\nOur emerging technology council comprised of global strategic partners also continues to help inform and advance our strategies.\nIn Europe, our automotive team delivered a terrific quarter as well despite the dynamic geopolitical environment. Sales in Europe increased 19% in local currency in the second quarter. Comparable sales increased 7% for the quarter and are up more than 40% on a 2-year stack basis. Growth continues to be driven by continued focus on strategic initiatives.\nInitiative highlights in Europe include new account expansion, continued NAPA rollout within and across the region and technology and supply chain investments. The recent Lausan and Knoll acquisitions in Spain and Germany, respectively, are also exceeding our expectations, and we're encouraged by the opportunities we're working on to capture in these businesses.\nIn the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased 11% in local currency from last year. Comparable sales were up 8% from last year and up 26% on a 2-year stack. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco and NAPA growth driven by strong execution of complementary customer value propositions and robust demand.\nOur motorcycle accessories division also performed well, benefiting from ongoing store expansion. In addition, during the second quarter, our Asia Pac team completed the acquisition of STEDI, a leading Australian branded direct-to-consumer distributor of lighting products focused on the 4-wheel drive market. The acquisition creates a differentiated product offering in a multibillion dollar profitable high-growth segment in Australia and New Zealand.\nTurning to the Global Industrial segment. During the second quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $547 million or 34.5%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter, and comparable sales which exclude the benefit of KDG increased 18% versus last year. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable growth driven by the strong performance in our North American business.\nThe strength in our North American industrial performance was broad-based with double-digit sales growth across virtually all product categories and major industries served with particular strength coming from equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement and automotive customers.\nIndustrial segment profit was $225 million or 10.6% of sales, a new record for the Industrial segment. This represents a 110-basis-point increase from the same period last year. The improvement is a result of Motion's impressive growth and disciplined operating performance.\nFor the second quarter, inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range, consistent with the levels we saw in the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational, and we do not expect any significant shifts in product inflation in our industrial business through the balance of 2022.\nSelect initiative highlights contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business includes sales programs to capture profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data-driven strategic pricing and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omnichannel experience and inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives.\nAs Paul mentioned, the KDG acquisition has added to the Motion team momentum. The teams are executing well-defined plans with customers, suppliers and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined business. To provide a bit more commentary on the recent integration progress, the team successfully onboarded KDG associates to Motion HR programs, accelerated the realignment of functional support teams, integrated systems and accelerated the colocation of overlapping branches.\nIn addition, the team partnered with vendors to improve programs and product availability, utilize cross-functional field teams to sell services across shared customers, harmonize inventory strategies, and rebranded stores under the Motion banner. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan. We're extremely pleased with the momentum of the integration efforts and excited for the growth opportunities as one Motion team.\nAs we execute on our global initiatives, we complement them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. The M&A pipeline continues to be active, and we'll remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value.\nIn summary, we had another terrific quarter, which resulted in record sales and profit for Genuine Parts Company. We acknowledge that the macro environment remains dynamic, but we learned as a team from the challenges presented by the pandemic. We continue to prioritize our customers as we analyze our business indicators, remain agile and strategically invest with discipline in initiatives that extend our global leadership positions.\nThank you again to the entire GPC team for an exceptional quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nHerbert C. Nappier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we had an excellent second quarter, and I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights. Our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which exclude nonrecurring items that I will cover in more detail shortly.\nTotal GPC sales were $5.6 billion in the second quarter, up $819 million or 17.1% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects an 11.5% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit inflation and an 8.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 3.3% unfavorable impact of foreign currency.\nOur gross margin was 35%, a 30-basis-point decrease compared to the second quarter last year and in line with our expectations. Our gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by headwinds from anticipated moderation in supplier incentives, foreign currency and the timing of inflation in certain product categories. These headwinds were substantially offset by the ongoing favorable impact of strategic category management initiatives where we continue to leverage our growing global scale.\nAs an example of our strategic initiatives and category management, our teams are utilizing technology, innovative data analytics and AI to forecast supply chain lead times and changes in market demand to ensure optimal inventory levels. These actions, along with our pricing initiatives, positively impacted our gross margin in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect our gross margin rate to be consistent with 2021 as we are relentlessly managing the impact of product and supplier price increases and our costs.\nOur total operating and nonoperating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, were approximately $1.5 billion, up 15% from 2021 and at 27.6% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales in the prior year. We continue to leverage our expenses despite ongoing inflationary pressures across all costs particularly in freight and shipping charges. Our teams remain focused on further reducing expenses and driving operational efficiencies across the business.\nWith our strong performance, segment profit was $548 million, up 24%. And our segment profit margin was 9.8%, a 60-basis-point increase from last year and up 160 basis points from 2019. With a very challenging operating environment over the past few years, ranging from the pandemic to current inflationary dynamics, we are very proud of the work our teams have done to improve our segment margin over the last 3 years.\nAs outlined in our earnings release, our second quarter results include 2 nonrecurring items. The first item relates to the sale of S.P. Richards Real Estate, which generated $140 million in cash proceeds and resulted in a nonrecurring gain of $103 million. The S.P. Richards properties sold this quarter were not divested with that business in 2020, and we are extremely pleased to monetize these assets and reinvest this capital across the GPC portfolio.\nIn addition, during the second quarter, we incurred approximately $25 million of costs related to our KDG acquisition, including a noncash impairment charge of $17 million for legacy Motion brand names that will no longer be used as a result of the acquisition of KDG.\nOur second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $59 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the nonrecurring items I just discussed, was $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $253 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 26%. This strong growth is indicative of the crisp execution of our initiatives to deliver accelerated growth and profitability.\nAs we turn to our balance sheet, at June 30, our total accounts receivable balances were up 18%, with inventory up 17% and both in line with the increase in sales. Likewise, accounts payable increased 14% from 2021, which correlates to the increase in inventory.\nWe continue to generate strong cash flows with $392 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $791 million for the 6 months, up 12% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow up $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8x. This is slightly below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x and highlights our financial strength and flexibility.\nThe key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these included reinvestments in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring 2022, we have invested $153 million in capital expenditures, including $75 million in the second quarter and continue to plan for additional strategic investments through the balance of the year. These investments are primarily in technology and projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity throughout the business.\nBeyond CapEx, during 2022, we have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisition and returned $366 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $243 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $123 million in cash to repurchase 943,000 shares. As a reminder, we have increased the annual dividend for 66 consecutive years.\nTurning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our first quarter earnings release. We are raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.80 to $7.95, which represents an increase of 13% to 15% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.85. Our revised EPS guidance includes an incremental headwind of approximately $0.08 due to foreign currency relative to the outlook we provided in April. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in the range of 12% to 14%, an increase from 10% to 12% previously.\nBy business segment, we are guiding to the following: 6% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from 5% to 7% previously. The new outlook reflects 6% to 8% comp sales growth, consistent with our previous estimate. For the Industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to 26% to 28%, an increase from our previous outlook of 21% to 23%. The new outlook includes a 9% to 11% comp sales increase, which is up from 5% to 7% previously.\nWe've had an exceptional first half of 2022, boosted by our industrial business and the success of our acquisition of KDG along with solid global automotive results. Our outlook for the full year reflects our ongoing confidence in our businesses to execute on our strategies despite a dynamic and uncertain external landscape. Our continued strong cash flow generation also provides us with full flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return cash to our shareholders through our dividend.\nWe look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSidney G. Jones\n\nSVP of IR, Genuine Parts Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\nWith me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Bert Nappier, our EVP and CFO elect.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.\nToday's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, we are happy to have Bert Nappier on the call with us today. Bert joined us on February 28 as CFO-elect and has been working side by side with Carol to ensure a smooth transition in this key role. Turning to the first quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength in our results to start the year, and we're proud of the great work by all of our 52,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. .\nA few highlights in the quarter include new quarterly sales records for GPC and our Automotive and Industrial segment, segment margin expansion of 50 basis points, strong double-digit EPS growth and a strengthened balance sheet and strong cash flow.\nThe GPC team is focused on key strategic priorities to sustain accelerated sales growth, improved gross margins and enhanced operational efficiencies in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary prices at levels we haven't seen in 40-plus years.\nWe also executed on our acquisition strategy and our Industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of Kaman Distribution Group. And with the addition of Lausanne, which we announced last week, we've expanded our automotive footprint in Europe with the entry into key markets in Spain and Portugal, Europe's fifth largest market.\nFor the first quarter, total sales were $5.3 billion, a 19% increase from last year. We delivered our 18th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. All in, adjusted earnings per share were up 24%, representing our seventh straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth.\nTotal sales for Global Automotive were $3.3 billion for the quarter, an 11% increase from 2021 and representing 62% of total company sales. On a comp basis, sales were up 10%, driven by low double-digit comps in the U.S. and Canada and high single-digit sales comps in Europe and Australasia.\nThe sales cadence through the quarter was relatively steady with our strongest performance coming in the month of March with our teams posting a 30-plus percent increase on a 2-year stack. Our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales, and we have maintained our gross margins despite mid-single-digit inflation for the quarter.\nAs we look ahead, we believe the sales environment continues to support our pricing actions, and we expect current levels of inflation to continue through at least the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our strongest Q1 comps were in North America. In Canada, the continued reopening of the economy drove strong demand and a 14% increase in total sales with comp sales up 13%.\nIn the U.S., total sales were up 14.5% with comp sales up 12% from last year. These results reflect strengthening trends in our 2-year stacks for both markets. In the U.S., sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with double-digit commercial sales growth outperforming DIY.\nIn addition, ticket and traffic counts were both positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Sales were strong across a number of product categories such as brakes, heating and cooling and chassis. DIY sales continue to trend well above historical growth rates with enhanced in-store merchandising improved product assortments and our digital initiatives all driving solid growth.\nNAPA Online continues to be our fastest-growing sales channel, up nearly 50% from last year. In addition, our Afterpay payment service, which offers existing and new customers buy now pay later options has been well received by consumers and is driving higher basket sizes. We have launched Afterpay in other global markets, and we're excited to see the growth generated from this new service, both online and in-store.\nThe strength in commercial sales was driven by double-digit growth across the majority of our customer segments. Sales to our major account partners, NAPA AutoCare Centers, fleet, government and other wholesale customers were all strong, driven by the continued strength in demand for commercial repairs and maintenance.\nOur sales teams were also effective in attracting new business with national and regional accounts, fleets and AutoCare accounts. So an outstanding job by our teams and strong results across all our commercial accounts.\nFurthering our commitment to the Commercial segment, we are excited to return to the classroom with in-person training for our auto technicians across the industry. NAPA Autotech provides industry-leading virtual online and classroom training programs, as a value-add service for over 50,000 technicians each year. We are particularly proud to have more than 2,000 new techs in our accredited training program.\nOur European operations also had a strong start to the year with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. These results reflect solid growth across each of our 7 European markets and are especially impressive given the headwinds of a mild winter across Europe. Our AAG team continues to drive share gains through key account expansion and the continued rollout of NAPA branded products.\nAs announced last week, we expanded our presence into key markets in Spain and Portugal with the addition of Lausanne. Lausanne is a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts based in Bilbao, Spain with a nationwide footprint, including 1 national distribution center and 9 regional DCs servicing over 14,000 customer partners and key accounts.\nWith our entree into Spain and Portugal, both highly fragmented markets, we expect to further strengthen Lausanne's market-leading position by capitalizing on our European scale and purchasing expertise as well as leveraging our NAPA brand. We welcome the Lausanne team to the GPC family and we're excited to work together to maximize the growth opportunities in our European business.\nIn our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 10% from 2021 with comp sales up 8% and the strongest 2-year sales tax across our automotive operations. This represents a terrific start to 2022, despite the headwinds posed by the COVID outbreak and severe flooding during the quarter. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well, with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by the increased demand and share gains from accelerated digital strategies and store expansion.\nWith 2022, representing Repco's 100th anniversary, it's only fitting the Asia Pac team would have a standout year. So now let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were $2 billion for the quarter, a 34% increase from last year and representing 38% of total GPC sales. On a comp basis, which excludes KDG, sales were up 16%, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps driven primarily by the strong growth in our North American business.\nThe sales cadence strengthened throughout the quarter with March being the strongest of the 3 months. The strong sales momentum in our Industrial business reflects the benefits of our many growth initiatives and continued strength of the industrial economy as evidenced by the PMI and industrial production indices. PMI has consistently held at expansionary levels of 57 or above every month since October of 2020, and industrial production was up 8% in the first quarter its strongest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur Industrial team is executing on its sales programs to accelerate organic growth and delivered positive sales growth across every major product category and industry served with most up double digits. As mentioned earlier, our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of KDG. While Will is going to go into greater detail in a few moments, I would summarize by saying that we are on plan and generating expected synergies.\nWrapping up our Industrial review, our strong first quarter results gives us confidence in our growth plans and pricing actions, and we entered the second quarter with strong momentum. We expect continued healthy activity levels across the vast majority of our products and industries.\nFinally, it's important to add that we have been busy in 2022, building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. Our focus areas in 2022 include formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy and establishing reduction targets as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We will provide additional details and report on our progress in these areas in our 2022 sustainability report later this year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Paul's comments and thank the global GPC teams for the impressive start to 2022. The teams did a great job during the quarter and built on the strong finish to 2021.\nAs we traveled and visited the global operations during the quarter, the team energy is positive. There's a strong sense of focus and alignment, and it's encouraging to see the broad-based strength across the business. Our discussions centered around performance trends, initiative progress, talent and finding better ways to serve our customers.\nGlobal supply chain and inflation challenges are common topics and all are doing an excellent job to respond. The in-flight strategic initiatives continue to deliver impact. Our foundational priorities are talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Strategic M&A complements our initiatives. We added to our talent momentum during the quarter. In addition to Bert joining the team, we welcome Jeff England as EVP, Chief Supply Chain Officer of the U.S. Automotive business.\nJeff joins us following an impressive career over nearly 2 decades at Walmart. He will lead end-to-end supply chain execution for U.S. Automotive and brings disciplined strategic leadership and relevant expertise. We're excited to have him on the team.\nDuring our travels, we had the chance to meet with the Canadian automotive leadership team in person for the first time in 2 years. As Paul mentioned, the Canadian economy is showing encouraging signs of strength as it reopens from prolonged lockdowns and our Canadian team is well positioned with detailed market-level plans to capture the growth. We also traveled to Australia where we visited locations and performed deep-dive initiative reviews.\nLike Canada, this was the first time in over 2 years, the extended GPC and Australian leadership team was together in person. CPC Asia Pac continues to capture market share with its differentiated customer value propositions, new store rollouts and unique digital and brand strategies, all of which are delivering winning profitable growth. We look forward to celebrating the 100th year anniversary with the GPC Asia Pac team later this year.\nIn both Australia and Canada, sales effectiveness initiatives focused on market density, data and analytics and customer loyalty are proving effective. Our technology initiatives are building momentum. The teams are gaining positive traction in our efforts across B2B digital, inventory, store systems, payments and workforce management platform.\nWe continue to invest in diverse engineering talent across the technology organization and evolve our operating approach to leverage common solutions around the globe. Our supply chain initiatives are advancing well. In the quarter, we visited with various U.S. automotive DC leadership teams in the Mid-Atlantic region, where we walked facilities assessed operational performance and thank the themes.\nOur U.S. automotive distribution facilities are working hard to process strong demand despite challenging supply chain and labor dynamics. We also spent time with our industrial business and met with the extended Motion leadership team. We reviewed the successes of our fulfillment center and network optimization effort in Florida. The strategy improved service levels, enhances product depth and reduces duplicative fixed costs.\nSimilarly, while in Australia, we received an encouraging update on the traction of network and automation investments in New Zealand and Victoria. In each example, our supply chain investments improve the customer experience and enhance operating productivity. Our emerging technology initiatives made progress in the quarter as well.\nWe hosted our first emerging tech supplier council session with various automotive partners to learn from each other and explore opportunities. We executed various targeted inventory strategies to serve current EV market needs rolled out marketing efforts, added dedicated emerging tech talent and advanced numerous emerging tech commercial partnership discussions across Europe, Canada and the U.S. M&A bolt-on execution continues to be active.\nWe remain focused on adding density to existing priority markets, entering complementary strategic geographies and/or adding new product expertise or capabilities. The KDG integration and synergy efforts are ahead of plan. The dedicated integration team is executing a disciplined playbook to deliver value. The feedback from teammates, customers and vendors continues to be extremely positive. The executive leadership, functional and field operating structures are already realigned and the teams are working well together as 1 Motion team.\nAs an example, the team rebranded the combined fluid power offering to Motion Fluid Power Solutions. Based on Motion's existing vendor relationships, we onboarded over 20 new strategic fluid power supplier relationships, which added 2 million SKUs to our offering, ultimately giving our customers more choice and our vendor partners and sales teams more opportunity to deliver growth.\nThe team also realigned our automation and robotics business under the Motion AI or Motion Automation Intelligence brand which now creates a $500 million leading national automation platform. We are really pleased with the early momentum of the integration efforts and are excited about the value creation outlook. In summary, our travels during the quarter reinforced that our initiatives are well defined and the teams are focused to execute. Our people care about serving our customers, always impressed with their deep expertise and are energized to deliver results.\nBefore I turn it over to Carol, I'd like to again acknowledge her amazing career at GPC, and Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we thank you for all you've done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years. With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Will, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're very pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on our quarterly adjusted results, which exclude the transaction and other costs related to the acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, as outlined in our press release.\nTotal GPC sales were $5.3 billion in the first quarter, up $830 million or 19% from last year. Our gross margin for the quarter was 34.6%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter last year, primarily driven by the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. These gains were partially offset by slight headwinds from supplier incentives shifts in business mix, foreign currency and the timing of inflation in certain product categories.\nOur total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.48 billion, up 18% from 2021 and at 27.9% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales last year. Double-digit comp sales growth in the first quarter drove SG&A expense leverage despite the ongoing inflationary pressures in areas such as wages and freight.\nOur teams are focused on executing our strategic initiatives to further reduce expenses and drive operational efficiencies. With our strong sales and improvement in gross margin and SG&A, segment profit was $453 million, up 25% and our segment profit margin was 8.6%, a 50 basis point increase from last year.\nOur tax rate was 24.5% compared to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2021 with the increase in rate due to several factors, including the impact of prior year gains on the sale of real estate and geographic shifts in income.\nFirst quarter adjusted net income was $266 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.86. This compares to $218 million or $1.50 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 24%. Really solid work across our global teams to achieve this strong growth in the first quarter.\nSo turning to our first quarter results by segment. Total automotive revenue was $3.3 billion, up 11% from last year. Segment profit was $265 million, up 12% with profit margin at 8.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from 2021 and up 120 basis points from 2019.\nOur Industrial sales were $2 billion in the quarter, up 34% from 2021. Segment profit of $188 million was up a strong 50% from a year ago and profit margin improved to 9.3%, up 100 basis points from 2021 and up 180 basis points from 2019. This margin improvement reflects the benefits of strong sales growth and strategic initiatives in areas such as category management and pricing.\nIn addition, the industrial team is also advancing their plans to gain further operational efficiencies. Both our Automotive and Industrial teams are doing a tremendous job of managing through a dynamic environment and delivering margin expansion. Through their steady focus on our strategic priorities, we've improved our total segment profit margin by 150 basis points from the first quarter of 2019.\nSo now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At March 31, our total accounts receivable was up 18%, including the sale of $200 million in receivables under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our inventory was up 17% or up 9% excluding KDG, a function of the sales increase and accounts payable increased 16% from 2021, in line with the increase in inventory.\nOur AP to inventory ratio of 124% was unchanged from December 31 and the prior year. Our total debt at March 31 is $3.5 billion, up $900 million or 34% from March of last year, driven by the $1 billion in new public debt related to the KDG acquisition.\nWe closed the first quarter with available liquidity of $2 billion, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2x, this is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x and supportive of our investment-grade rating. We generated $399 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which has improved from last year. For the full year, we expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range and free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.\nWe believe our continued strong cash flow and the financial strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, support our growth plans and provide for disciplined, value-creating capital allocation. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nFor the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $78 million for a broad range of productivity-enhancing investments. We also invested $1.4 billion of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. And while KDG represents most of this investment, we also acquired several automotive store groups across North America. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional acquisitions, and we remain focused on the successful integration of KDG into Motion.\nIn the first quarter, we also paid $116 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend every year since going public in 1928 and the 10% increase for 2022 represents our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. And as part of our share repurchase program, we used $73 million to purchase 570,000 shares in the first quarter. The company is authorized to repurchase up to 11.3 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead.\nSo turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are raising our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 1.5% to 2% headwind from foreign currency translation and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions.\nBy business segment, we are guiding to plus 5% to plus 7% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. The new outlook reflects plus 6% to plus 8% comp sales growth, which is up from our previous estimate of plus 5% to plus 7%.\nFor the Industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to plus 21% to plus 23%, an increase from our previous outlook of plus 20% to plus 22%. This new outlook includes a plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales increase, which is up from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously.\nOn the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.70 to $7.85, which is up 11% to 14% from 2021. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $7.45 to $7.60. While the operating environment remains very dynamic, we are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter and the continued momentum in our businesses as we move forward into the second quarter.\nTo close, as we previously noted, I will be retiring from GPC at the end of May. So this will be my last earnings call as CFO. It's been a privilege and an honor to work for such an amazing company over the last 30 years, and I fully expect the friendships that I've made over the years to last a lifetime. I'm proud of the progress we've made together, and I know that the best days for GPC are yet to come.\nI could not be more excited for Bert Nappier to start as CFO on May 2 and Bert and I have been working hand-in-hand over the last 2 months traveling to meet with all of our business units and our leaders as well as spending time with our finance and accounting teams. It was also nice to meet with many of you on our recent visit to New York. I personally enjoyed seeing everyone in person for the first time in 2 years, and I know that Bert found that time extremely beneficial. I'm confident that Bert's transition to CFO will be smooth and seamless and know he looks forward to working with each of you very soon. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Paul.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Carol. Another excellent review of our financial performance and fitting that our results were so strong for your last call as CFO. .\nAs a reminder to everyone on the call, Carol has had an incredible 30-year career at GPC, serving in nearly every key financial role before being named CFO in 2013. In her 9 years as CFO, her leadership and her positive influence on the company's success has been immeasurable.\nShe has served on our executive leadership team our Investment Committee, our Cybersecurity Committee. And in addition, she has held leadership positions in everything from supply chain and logistics to real estate and in addition to our financial responsibilities. She has been a valued partner to me and the entire GPC leadership team as well as to our Board, and she'll be greatly missed by all of us. So thank you, Carol, and best wishes to you, to Mike and your entire family.\nSo in closing, we are proud of our progress in the first quarter and the strong results to start the year. delivering a new sales record, continued margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth, a strength in balance sheet and strong cash flow highlight our first quarter performance. At the same time, our teams have done a terrific job of integrating KDG into the Motion business.\nLooking ahead, the increase in our sales and earnings outlook reflects the confidence in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability as we build on the positive momentum in our automotive and industrial businesses. While cognizant of the many uncertainties in the global economy, we believe GPC is well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value-creating capital allocation while enhancing shareholder value.\nWe thank you for your interest in GPC. And we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering strong results. So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSidney G. Jones\n\nSVP of IR, Genuine Parts Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call.\nThe GPC team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, further building on the positive momentum of the first 9 months of 2021. We are proud of our progress through the year and thankful to our 52,000 teammates for their hard work and ongoing commitment to excellence.\nWith a tailwind of strong industry fundamentals, we executed on our key strategic priorities to accelerate sales, improved gross margin and enhanced operational efficiencies, which resulted in double-digit sales and earnings growth for both the quarter and full year. Our earnings growth and continued focus on working capital improvements also helped us to deliver strong cash flow. So just a tremendous effort by our global teams. They were laser-focused throughout the year and successfully navigated the ongoing challenges of the global supply chain, COVID disruptions and inflationary pressures.\nIn early January, we successfully closed on our acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, an industrial distributor of power transmission, automation and fluid power solutions. We are integrating this highly synergistic acquisition into our Motion business to enhance our scale and further strengthen our market-leading position. We are pleased to welcome the Kaman team to GPC and we look forward to creating significant shareholder value as a premier leader in industrial solutions.\nTurning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, a 13% increase from last year with broad strength across all our businesses. We delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. These efforts led to an 18% increase in the quarter in adjusted earnings per share.\nTotal sales for the Global Automotive Group were $3.2 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from 2020. On a comp basis, sales were up 11% from 2020 with our U.S. business posting the strongest year-over-year comps and each of our international operations achieving high single-digit sales comp. In addition, we experienced a steady sales cadence throughout the quarter with double-digit total sales increases in all 3 months.\nThe ongoing economic recovery has led to strong customer demand. Improving miles driven, delays of new car production and rising used car prices are keeping more cars on the road longer, generating increased repairs and maintenance. Our strategic growth initiatives are proving effective as well. We continue to work closely with global suppliers to manage through product delays and logistical challenges to improve inventory availability. Additionally, our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales and maintain margins throughout the inflationary environment in the latter half of 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, we also added 130,000 SKUs to our e-catalog with the integration of Auto Accessories Garage. We were also pleased to expand our global store footprint with the addition of several bolt-on acquisitions. In total, we added more than 50 net new stores across our network, with most of these coming in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, as we look ahead to April, we are excited for the launch of the new AAA-branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers.\nLooking next at our Automotive highlights by region. Total U.S. sales were up 15%, with comp sales up 13% from last year. In Canada, total sales were up 11% with comp sales up 9% from 2020. The growth in Canada was much improved from the third quarter as the easing of lockdowns drove strong demand throughout the end of the year. In the U.S., sales to both commercial and retail customers were up double digits, with positive ticket and traffic counts for the fourth consecutive quarter. Likewise, sales were strong across a broad range of products with categories such as chassis, exhaust, brakes and ride control all outperforming.\nOur DIY business remains strong, trending well above historical growth rates for the past several quarters. While initially driven by the increase in DIY demand due to COVID, we have sustained that growth through a number of initiatives, including enhanced in-store merchandising, training and development, and the continued rollout of customer services such as AfterPay, which offers existing and new customers buy now, pay later option. This program is in 1,200 stores today and currently available for all online purchases.\nNAPA online B2C sales continue to be our fastest-growing sales channel, up over 40% in Q4 and 53% for the full year, a 3x increase from our 2019 volume. The strength in commercial sales was driven by high-teen growth to our major account partners and sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers were up low teens. The surge in members continued through the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 18,000 NAPA AutoCare Centers, an increase of over 800 shops from 2020. Rounding out our commercial segments, fleet, government and other wholesale customers posted low double-digit sales growth for the quarter, though strong results across all our commercial accounts.\nIn Europe, our AAG team continued to perform well with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. Our team delivered solid results across each of our 7 markets, with the U.K. and Benelux each posting 20% plus growth. Our teams on the ground continue to expand our market share across all important key account segment as well as accelerating the rollout of NAPA-branded products. In addition, we are pleased to report our 2021 acquisitions of Wind Parts, an online provider of parts and accessories; and J&S, a multi-store operation based in Ireland, both are performing above expectations.\nIn our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 11% from 2020, with comp sales up 9% from last year and up a strong 25% on a 2-year stack. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well, with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by accelerated digital strategy, NAPA store expansion and the Q4 reopening of key metro markets.\nSo now let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from last year, with comp sales up 12% from 2020. This is our third consecutive quarter of double-digit comps for this segment, driven by strong growth in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses. The sales cadence was consistent through the quarter with double-digit sales growth in all 3 months.\nThe continued improvement in our Industrial sales trends reflects the benefits of our growth initiatives and ongoing strength of the industrial economy. Our Industrial team delivered positive sales growth across virtually all major product categories and industries we serve, including double-digit increases in the majority of our industry groups. These include sectors such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and aggregate and cement, among others.\nOur Industrial team continues to execute several initiatives to drive profitable growth. Our omnichannel build-outs of accelerated e-commerce growth and is driving sales with new customers. We are encouraged by the incremental sales for our inside sales center and on motion.com. We have expanded our industrial services and value-add solutions capabilities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. And our enhanced strategy to compete in a dynamic pricing environment provides us a competitive advantage while also helping us offset inflationary pressures. Our Motion team made tremendous progress with these initiatives in the quarter and the year, and we expect to make further progress again in 2022.\nIn addition, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our products and services offerings and expand our footprint. The added scale, presence and capabilities through the KDG acquisition is a great example, checking several boxes with its core power transmission and bearings business, and automation and fluid power industrial services and solutions. KDG's highly complementary growth and productivity strategies, product offering, and value-added services provide tremendous synergies and growth prospects. Our Motion team is actively bringing together the world-class talent and industrial expertise of these 2 organizations to build an even stronger business.\nIn 2021, we remain focused on the positive impact of sustainable business practices. We updated our 2021 sustainability report, highlighting our progress in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, and reducing the environmental impact of our operations. Today, we are in process of measuring our global emissions and building a strategy for targeted improvement. We will be sharing additional highlights as we move through 2022.\nFinally, as most of you are probably aware, we announced last month that Carol will be retiring in May after an exceptional 30-year career. As our CFO for the past 9 years, Carol's leadership and countless contributions were integral to the significant growth and strong financial performance of the company. She will be greatly missed by all of us.\nWe were pleased to announce that Bert Nappier will be stepping in as our next CFO. Bert is a strategic financial executive with a diverse background spanning 25 years, including the past 16 years with FedEx serving most recently as EVP Finance and Treasurer. Bert has also served as President of FedEx Express Europe and CEO of TNT Express. We are confident Burt's strong financial background along with his extensive international experience will make him a great addition to the GPC team. Carol and Bert will work together over the next few months to ensure an orderly and seamless transition. Carol will be with us for our first quarter earnings call in April, and Bert will join us on the call as well. We look forward to introducing Bert to all of you in the months ahead.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?\n\nWilliam P. Stengel\n\nPresident, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone.\nAs we reflect on 2021 and pivot to 2022, I'd like to reiterate Paul's comments and thank the global GPC teams for an amazing performance in 2021. Passion for our customers, a team approach and relentless hard work translated into impressive results. We're incredibly proud of the entire GPC team. We also want to thank our strategic suppliers who closely partner with us in a challenging environment.\nAs we discussed entering 2021, we wanted to catapult out of 2020 to deliver a great year. We're proud that each of our global business units delivered, exceeding initiative and annual financial commitments in 2021. Our strong global performance is a great example of the power of one GPC team when we focus on key priorities and collectively execute as a team.\nWe enter 2021 with a clear strategy and focused business mix. Across the company, we identified strategic initiatives to further simplify and integrate our operations. We do this to enable a better customer experience and move at a faster, more efficient team pace. Our 2021 plans are part of a strategic vision that extends our leadership positions in attractive, highly fragmented markets.\nAs part of our vision, our foundational priorities remain talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Each business unit and functional teams are executing multiyear plans across these pillars. As Paul highlighted, 2021 offered numerous examples of great progress. Progress to simplify include our action to optimize facility footprints, realign team structures, offshore field support activities, reduce IT system complexity, streamline back-office processes, leverage shared global vendor relationships and centralized indirect sourcing activities to name a few. In each example, we reduced cost, increased efficiency and better positioned our business to scale growth. Our One GPC team approach enables us to leverage GPC's scale and create value together.\nAs we simplify our customer experience continues to be at the center of our daily action. We continue to listen, understand and act. As an example, the U.S. Automotive team revamped our Voice of Customer Program to create more actionable data-backed customer feedback. We've seen a 40% reduction in customer-issued tickets, 50% reduction in time to resolution and 90% reduction in unresolved issues.\nOur long-term success starts first with talent and culture, attracting and promoting talent to lead high-performing diverse teams. We made impressive progress in 2021. A few examples include the addition of merchandising and supply chain leadership at U.S. Automotive, technology leadership in North America Automotive, field leadership and sales promotions in North America Industrial and executive leadership promotions in Australia and Europe. Despite the challenging talent environment, we believe our recent progress supports the differentiated and inclusive employee value proposition GPC offers.\nAs an example, in our Atlanta headquarter office, over 60% of our current teammates represent diverse talent and 75% of our new hires in 2021 represented diverse teammates. We are committed to our GPC culture advantage.\nOur sales effectiveness initiatives delivered exciting wins in 2021 as the teams achieved broad-based profitable growth. We make sure we adjust our resources and strategies to serve our customer segments profitably and efficiently. Examples of our actions include inside sales coverage, corporate account disciplines, digital marketing strategies, strategic promotional activities and feet on the street to name a few. We complement these selling efforts with data-backed pricing and sourcing initiatives to ensure we deliver profitable growth. Technology enables this disciplined approach to sales excellence.\nOur technology initiatives also delivered returns in 2021. In North America Automotive, we made progress across digital, store systems, supply chain and data platform initiatives. Examples include enhancements for competitive pricing intelligence, customer relationship management tools, product catalog and site search, and customer-specific system integrations. We accelerated third-party technology partners that offer faster path to delivering new capabilities and impact. We also made good progress to standardize and simplify our foundational tech infrastructure. These investments support a seamless omnichannel customer experience and are enabling above-average growth across all our digital channels.\nWe also made progress with supply chain initiatives. The challenging global supply chain reinforced our focus on operational productivity investments. Our investments in supply chain talent, inventory, technology, labor and freight productivity, facility automation and network optimization are gaining traction. Our focus on emerging technology accelerated in 2021 with talent, analytics, strategic planning and global teamwork. Examples of progress include commercial partnerships with emerging technology companies such as Arrival and Wallbox, focused partnerships with key strategic suppliers and merchandising strategies for existing EV repair needs, to name just a few.\nM&A execution was also active in 2021. We completed various U.S. automotive and international bolt-ons that extend leadership positions in key local markets. We closed the year with the announcement of the KDG acquisition, which extends the market-leading position of our North American industrial platform. As Paul mentioned, the integration efforts are well underway and we remain bullish on the outlook for the combined business and the synergy plans.\nAs we pivot to 2022, we have the same level of focus. Our 2022 priorities remain unchanged as we look to continue the momentum. The global GPC teams have a strong resolve to take on uncontrollable challenges, and we're confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and earn success.\nBefore I turn it over to Carol, I'd like to acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we appreciate all you have done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol?\n\nCarol B. Yancey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.\nWe're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on quarterly and full year adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the unusual items outlined in our press release.\nRecapping revenues. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% from 2020. For the full year, sales were $18.9 billion, up 14%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 35.3%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the year, gross margin improved 70 basis points to 35.2% versus last year. For the quarter and the full year, our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to strong sales volumes and the ongoing positive impact of strategic category management initiatives.\nOur total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% from 2020 and at 28% of sales. For the year, these expenses are $5.31 billion, up 13% and also at 28% of sales. The increase in expenses for the quarter and the full year primarily reflect the increase in variable costs on our strong sales growth, including the impact of higher incentive compensation. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost pressures in areas such as base wages, freight and health insurance.\nAnd finally, our prior year results included benefits of temporary savings related to the pandemic. Our permanent cost savings achieved in 2020 helped to offset rising costs and difficult year-over-year comparisons. And as we've shared today and throughout the year, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to further reduce our expenses and to improve our operational efficiencies. This will be important in managing through the continuing inflationary pressures on costs in 2022.\nOur segment profit in the fourth quarter was $420 million, up 12% and our segment profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.8% last year. This slight decline was expected and primarily reflects the impact of prior year temporary savings and the year-over-year increase in incentive compensation. Our 8.7% margin reflects a 100 basis point improvement from 2019. For the full year, segment profit was $1.7 billion, up 24% on a 14% sales increase and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 8.2% last year, a 60 basis point increase from 2020 and 100 basis points from 2019. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2000, so we're very pleased with the improvement in margin and the tremendous work by our teams.\nOur tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.6% compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the decrease in rate primarily related to a geographic shift in income. For the year, our tax rate was 24.9% compared to 24.5% in the prior year and primarily due to the increase in certain international tax rates throughout the year.\nFourth quarter net income from continuing operations on both a reported and adjusted basis was $256 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.79. This compares to $221 million or $1.52 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year or an 18% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $899 million or $6.23 per share, and adjusted net income was $997 million or $6.91 per share, a 31% increase from 2020.\nSo now turning to our fourth quarter results by segment. Total Automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 13% from last year. Our segment profit increased 11% to $266 million, with profit margin at 8.3%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to higher incentive compensation and the prior year benefit of temporary savings, this represents a 110 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the strong underlying progress in our operations. For the year, profit margin was 8.6%, up 60 basis points from 2020 and up 100 basis points from 2019.\nOur Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 13% from 2020. Our segment profit of $154 million was up 15% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, up 20 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019. For the full year, profit margin for this segment is 9.4%, up 90 basis points from 2020 and up 130 basis points from 2019.\nSo now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At December 31, our total accounts receivable were up 15%, primarily due to the increase in sales and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory was up 11%, a function of the sales increase and our commitment to having the right parts in the right place at the right time. Accounts payable increased 16% from 2020 due to the increase in inventory and extended payment terms with our global suppliers. Our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 124% from 118% in the prior year.\nOur total debt at December 31 is $2.4 billion, down 10% from December of 2020. We closed the fourth quarter with available liquidity of $2.2 billion, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.4x from 1.9x in 2020. In early January this year, we issued $1 billion in new public debt in connection with the KDG acquisition. This consisted of a 3-year $500 million bond at a 1.75% interest rate and 10-year $500 million bonds at a 2.75% rate. This raises our total debt to approximately $3.4 billion and our forecasted debt-to-EBITDA to 1.8x, which is well within our targeted range and maintains our investment-grade rating.\nWe generated $250 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, and our earnings growth and working capital drove $1.3 billion in cash from operations for the full year. Our free cash flow was $992 million. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $266 million for a broad range of investments such as supply chain projects at our distribution centers, including automation and other equipment for added efficiencies, digital initiatives and IT systems and software development. We will continue to reinvest in our business to drive organic growth and to improve the productivity in our operations in 2022.\nWe also invested $284 million of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments primarily consisted of various automotive store groups across our geographies as well as online and Internet businesses, which provides us with expanded market coverage and a high return on investment. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both the Automotive and Industrial segments, and we look forward to the benefits of the Kaman Distribution acquisition.\nThe company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948. And in 2021, we paid total cash dividends of approximately $466 million. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.58 per share annual dividend for 2022, representing our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 10% increase from the $3.26 per share paid in 2021.\nAdditionally, we have an active share buyback program dating back to 1994. In the fourth quarter, we used $50 million to purchase 400,000 shares. And for the year, we used $334 million to purchase 2.6 million shares. As of December 31, we were authorized to repurchase up to 11.9 million shares, and we continue to be active in this program in 2022.\nSo turning to our outlook for 2022. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 2% headwind from foreign currency translation and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales growth which is before the impact of acquisitions and FX. And a total sales increase of plus 20% to plus 22% for the Industrial segment which includes the addition of KDG and a 4% to 6% comp sales increase. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.60 and this represents an 8% to 10% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2021.\nSo that's my financial update. And throughout the quarter and full year, our teams were focused on driving strong sales, improved margins, exceptional cash flow, and they delivered on every count. We're thankful for all the great work by our teammates. And as we move forward in the new year, there is tremendous momentum in our businesses. We look forward to reporting on our first quarter 2022 performance in April.\nAs Paul mentioned earlier, the April earnings call will be my last as CFO. It was a difficult decision to retire from the company that I love, but the timing was right, and we're in capable hands with a talented team in place to support Bert. He is well qualified and his experience and skills make him the right person to serve as our next CFO. I'm excited to work with Bert over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition.\nThank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul.\n\nPaul D. Donahue\n\nChairman & CEO, Genuine Parts Company\n\nThank you, Carol.\nWith the fourth quarter now behind us, we can safely say that 2021 was an exceptional year for GPC. Throughout the year, our team focused on advancing the strategic priorities for our global Automotive and industrial businesses. With the backdrop of our multiyear portfolio optimization strategy, the economic recovery and strong industry fundamentals, we generated double-digit sales and earnings growth and significantly improved our profit margin.\nWe are proud of our strong financial performance and the many accomplishments of the GPC team. Our results drove strong cash flow, which further supported our balance sheet strength. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing for enhanced productivity and growth through capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. In total, we were pleased to effectively deploy $1.35 billion for these key priorities in 2021.\nSo now turning to 2022, we are confident in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability as we build on the underlying momentum in both our Automotive and Industrial operations and realize the benefits from our acquisition of KDG. We are well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined, value-creating capital allocation, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you.\nWe thank you for your interest in and support of GPC, and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering a terrific year for GPC. So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

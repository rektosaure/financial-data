[Operator Instructions] You may also sending a post at T-Mobile IR at mikesievert I would now like to turn the conference over to Cathy Yao, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead.\n\nQuan Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Srini Gopalan, our COO and incoming CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cathy. Great job. Good morning, everybody. Well, as you can see, Srini and I are here in New York with the senior team, ready to discuss another truly extraordinary quarter for T-Mobile. But first, let me do a couple of welcomes. I want to first start by welcoming Andre Almeida to the team and to the table. Andre is a deep industry expert and a long-time colleague of Srini's, and he has also been a strategic adviser to me on many topics for many years, and I am so happy that he is here leading such a big part of our team.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAnd also, You all know Dr. John Saw, now serving as our President of Technology, and resident genius. John, thanks for stepping into this expanded role for us as President of Technology. John and I go way back to 2009 at Clearwire. So together and separately, we've been stewards of this centerpiece of T-Mobile's 5G spectrum strategy for a long time. It's great to have you here as our President.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Well, let me just start by saying this. This call is an especially meaningful one for me as it actually marks the 50th quarterly earnings report for T-Mobile. And that means it's also my 50th report here. I've been here for every single one to offer my perspective and to help shape our narrative about the future, and I have had a blast. Leading this company over the past 13 years has been the honor of a lifetime. Together we've transformed T-Mobile from a distant #4 player in crisis and decline into the world's most successful and customer-centric telecommunications company. I've seen T-Mobile go from last to first, with the best network, the best value, the best customer experience in the market. And today, that margin of our differentiation is only widening and the growth and financial momentum that flows from this in many ways, only just beginning.\nI'm excited to continue to support this team right here, and the strategies that enable the success in my new role as Vice Chairman. Just a few weeks ago, I talked about what it means to get CEO succession right, but you do it when three things are true. First, when the company has never been more successful. Second, when the opportunity ahead has never been more exciting. And third and most importantly, when the leader to take us into the future is fully ready. Q3 is living proof that all three are true for T-Mobile right now. Now Srini is going to cover the results here in a minute with you, but I just want to say, \"Wow, what another spectacular quarter.\" This team once again delivered the thoughtful, profitable and durable growth for which we are known. We smashed not only all-time customer records, like best-ever postpaid account growth, best ever total postpaid net additions while also leading the industry in postpaid phones with over 1 million nets and phone churn. But importantly, we also once again led the industry in financial growth by a wide margin across a wide variety of metrics beating expectations again.\nClearly, it is evident that this team under Srini's leadership executes like no other team. This quarter was a showcase of Srini's and this entire team's ability to rally the organization to deliver exceptional results while at the same time, building on the durable advantages that make it all possible. T-Mobile has never been stronger. Our growth runway is broad-based. Our differentiation is widening, the Un-carrier ethos continues to disrupt the industry and delight customers, the opportunity ahead to generate even more outsized durable and profitable growth across wireless, broadband, smart new adjacencies as well as digital transformation has never been more exciting. So with that, let's dive in. Srini, in more ways than one, over to you, my friend.\n\nSrinivasan Gopalan\n\nManagement Board Member - Germany & MD of Telekom Deutschland GmbH\n\nThank you, Mike. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining in. I can't wait to start talking about Q3, but I'll take a minute. I just want to start by saying it's an incredible privilege to be here with this fantastic team, the best in the industry. And in the last 13 years, Mike, you have truly turned around this business and you've made the Un-carrier into this force for good. This disruptive, innovative, the most admired telco in the world. The network has gone from last to first, like you've talked about and we've delivered an industry-leading customer and financial growth. You and the team have created more value than any other CEO in the history of this industry, not just in the U.S., but globally. Thank you.\nLook, I've been involved in this team for some time now. And the one truly amazing thing, the Un-carrier has done, and this is rare in this industry, differentiation. It's the one truly rare commodity in this industry. For a large part of this journey, that differentiation has come from outstanding customer value and experience. And as I look forward now, the foundation for the next big leap has already been laid. We have the opportunity to widen this differentiation even further with network leadership and digital transformation. I can talk about this all day, but I'll come back to it in our continuing strategy. But first off, to Q3 and the phenomenal quarter we've delivered.\nStarting with wireless, we had our all-time best postpaid customer account growth. And that's saying something when it comes from the Un-carrier. We achieved our best-ever total postpaid net additions and delivered over 1 million postpaid phone net additions, our best Q3 in over a decade. And that coming from T-Mobile is something.\nWhat I like is how broad-based this growth is. It's in the top 100 markets, it's in smaller markets and rural areas. Even within the top 100, our postpaid share of households is up where we're #1, #2 and #3 in market share. So it's truly broad-based growth. And it's not just gross additions momentum. In Q3, we led the industry in postpaid phone churn. So across the board, tremendous customer momentum. And it's not just volume. It's also in value.\nWe saw postpaid ARPA grew by 3.8% on an organic basis when you exclude kind of the dilutive impact of UScellular, Metronet and Lumos. We're also delighted to have welcomed UScellular customers. to the T-Mobile family and provided them with immediate benefits from an improved network experience to great thankings like T-Mobile Tuesdays. Integration is off to the races we're using everything from the T-Mobile playbook that we learned and perfected with Sprint, and we're simultaneously deepening our relationships.\nLet me turn to broadband, another huge growth opportunity for us. Again, we led the industry with over 500,000 customer additions on 5G broadband and over 50,000 on the newest addition to our family fiber, and that includes the contribution from Metronet following our close on 24th July. This is an amazing business. And here's an often underrated fact. Our 5G broadband ARPUs and customer lifetime values are very similar to our postpaid phone business, and that just drives great value creation.\nNow our customer results and industry-leading customer results flow through to industry-leading financial growth. Our postpaid service revenue grew by 12% year-over-year. Now that's obviously industry-leading. Our service revenue as a whole, 9%; core adjusted EBITDA, 6%; and another incredible quarter of service revenue to free cash flow conversion at 26%. So there's great customer momentum. And importantly, that's translating into that one key metric, cash conversion. So overall, an amazing quarter.\nLet me come back to what I was saying earlier about my strategic priorities and spend a moment on that. We start by saying I have enormous conviction in what the team outlined during Capital Markets Day. And even more so now that we're a year into that journey. Everything we've seen in the last year makes us double down on our convictions and convinces us that we're heading in the right direction. I expect continued profitable growth in our core wireless and broadband businesses, and this is the big deal, which is that momentum, which we are seeing right now is being driven by widening differentiation, which means it's truly sustainable. And that widening differentiation is driven by kind of two big things. On the one hand, you have our growing network leadership, not just in reality, but in perception as well. And that's complemented by our digital transformation, which just takes pain out of the customer process.\nLet me talk about this in a bit more detail. Start with the natural place to start, our network. We're often asked how big is this whole network perception opportunity. Let me give you some sense of it. One out of every three AT&T and Verizon customers chose them at some point because they were the best network. And these customers are paying a premium for something that is simply no longer true. You work the math. That means there are 70 million customers that are paying a premium for something that is simply no longer true, and that we can unlock with our best network. And more and more of these customers are beginning to change their perception. In Q3, we hit an all-time high in our network perception amongst switches, and that's a big driver to the outperformance we're seeing.\nNow our network perception is changing because the reality is changing. Let me give you a couple of examples of how powerful our network is. Ookla data shows that our median download speeds on the new iPhone are nearly 90% faster than one of our benchmark competitors and over 40% faster than the other. That's why when you have jump balls with the device change, you see the Un-carriers continued outperformance, driving superiority in the network for a new device like this and such visible superiority is a huge driver to our performance.\nAnother great example is our 5G broadband business. Now using the fallow capacity model in the last 2 years, we've nearly doubled our number of customers. Each of them use 30% more. So a phenomenal 580 gigabytes a month. At the same time, so doubling customers, 30% more usage per customer, at the same time, our average download speeds have increased by nearly 50%, and our wireless speeds have gone up as well. That's what an Ultra capacity network truly looks like. And we're not standing still. So we're making progress on perception. The reality is only getting better, and we will not stop. We're not standing still. We're building and upgrading thousands of new cell sites, many of which are in smaller markets and rural areas, and we're deploying and leveraging our nationwide 5G advanced network. I want all of you to know that I am committed to not only being the network leader of today, but also investing tirelessly to defend and widen the margin of our network leadership for tomorrow.\nLet me talk a bit about digital transformation. The amount of friction and frustration we cause customers today because of our processes and the state of evolution in this industry is phenomenal. We have a huge opportunity to change that with our digital transformation, and we saw great progress in adoption. Now I love this stat. 3 out of 4 of our iPhone upgrades during our preorder window were digital. That is widening differentiation. Together with the stats I shared with you about network quality, that creates a moment where it's clear that we are different. And T-Life continues to be the center of our digital engagement with over 85 million app in stores. Look, I can sit here all day and talk about all of this. But ultimately, what will matter is our results going forward, quarter after quarter. And Q3 is just another proof point that the Un-carrier strategy is working, that our differentiation is widening.\nNow Peter will give you an update shortly on our guidance. I just want to say that I'm really excited to discuss our guidance in detail for '26 and '27 on our year-end call. I plan on increasing our guidance for '26 and '27, and that reflects the core strength in the underlying business and M&A. And I'm looking forward to our future. And as I look at it, it's even better than what we said a year ago.\nLet me conclude by saying our differentiation is only widening. This team's ability to deliver is totally unmatched. We've come a long way, and our most exciting days are ahead of us. Our future is bright. Our vision is clear. Our results will continue to speak for themselves as we march towards our lofty long-term goals. With that, over to you, Peter.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Srini. As you can see, we had a fabulous Q3, which underpins the confidence in our increased guidance. So starting with customers, we are raising our expectation for total postpaid net additions to now be between 7.2 million to 7.4 million, an increase of just over 1 million at the midpoint. As part of that total, we are also increasing our expectation for postpaid phone net additions now expected to be 3.3 million, highlighting the tremendous momentum we're seeing in the business. and on the strength of our T-Fiber rollout, we are also raising our fiber customer net additions guidance to be approximately 130,000 this year, up from approximately 100,000 previously. We now expect postpaid ARPA growth of at least 3.5% for the full year, including the dilutive impacts of UScellular, Metronet and Lumos. Excluding the impacts of UScellular and the Fiber JVs, our underlying ARPA growth is now expected to be up approximately 4% for the full year. We now expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $33.7 billion and $3.9 billion for the full year, an increase of $300 million at the midpoint, reflecting our ongoing core operating strength and the inclusion of UScellular into our full year guidance. .\nAnd speaking of UScellular in September, we both increased our synergy guidance to $1.2 billion in total OpEx and CapEx run rate synergies and accelerated the time line to realizing those run rate synergies to within 2 years of close. As part of that accelerated synergy realization plan, we expect to incur approximately $300 million in cost to achieve in Q4, primarily driven by merger-related costs related to UScellular which will be excluded from core adjusted EBITDA.\nIn network, where we remain focused on using our customer-driven coverage model to both defend and expand the margin of our network leadership, the merger also allowed us to accelerate a broader network transformation initiative focused on optimizing customer experience and value through cell site location optimization. As part of this effort in Q4, we expect to incur approximately $160 million in additional expenses related to cell site decommissioning that will be excluded from core adjusted EBITDA. With all M&A and financing incorporated, we anticipate Q4 depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3.7 billion and interest expense of $1 billion.\nAll right. Turning to cash CapEx. We now expect cash CapEx to be approximately $10 billion, an increase of $500 million, driven entirely by the inclusion of UScellular. And we now expect adjusted free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs in the range of $17.8 billion to $18 billion, representing an increase of $200 million at the lower end of the range.\nAll right. To sum it all up, not only did our results continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently execute and deliver outsized and profitable growth, we could not be more excited to carry our strong momentum far into the future. So with that, I'll now turn the call back to Cathy to begin the Q&A. Cathy?\n\nQuan Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Peter. All right, let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will start with a question on the phone and wrap a few minutes early for closing remarks today. Operator, first question, please.",

Please go ahead.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGood afternoon. Welcome to T-Mobile US's second quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO, Srini Gopalan, our COO, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, our earnings release, investor factbook, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP. Results discussed on this call can be found on our investor relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, Cathy, thank you. Thanks for keeping us out of trouble over there. Great job. Welcome everybody. Thanks for being with us. Good afternoon. We're coming to you live from Bellevue today. I've got the whole team here, and we are excited to talk to you about our Q2 results and, more importantly, to take your questions, and what a quarter it was. Our results were in one word, if I had to pick one. Fantastic. This team right here did it again. Delivering the consistent, differentiated, profitable growth that we are known for. We led the industry in both customer growth and in financial growth across multiple metrics. And, more importantly, we smashed our own records. This was the greatest Q2 for growth ever in T-Mobile's storied history, with the best Q2 postpaid phone nets ever.\nThe best Q2 for total postpaid net additions ever, and our best ever Q2 on gross additions too, with both gross and total postpaid, and both gross and net total postpaid adds up double digits YoY against a very strong 2024 comp. Equally as exciting, our postpaid account nets also accelerated YoY, and we saw our postpaid share of households grow in every single cohort within the top 100, and of course also in smaller markets and rural areas. The momentum is continuing with share of premium leadership and overall customer momentum right where we want it now. You may have heard others say that this is a highly competitive environment, and it is. But we love it that way, and we thrive in a dynamic environment like this one. Our results, including our value creation results in this dynamic environment, simply speak for themselves.\nThe quality of our customers continues to improve at a rapid pace. With ARPA growth up over 5%, our highest growth in eight years, our customers are continuing to self select up the rate card. Here's a new stat for you. After launching our new rate plans in April, within that premium segment we've been talking to you about, customers are loving our most premium tier within it more than ever, selecting our new experience beyond plan at more than double the rate of Go5G Next just a year ago and up over 50% in just one quarter. Our business group continues to break growth records as well, leading the industry once again in net additions, and we are not standing still.\nJust yesterday we announced a new multi-year partnership with cable to provide mobile service to small and mid-market businesses to supercharge our growth in an area where we have little exposure. Today, in a true win-win, the deal focuses our partners in the exact areas that would drive incremental revenue, because our strongest T-Mobile branded growth comes on the one hand from the very smallest businesses transacting at retail where we already compete with cable, and on the other hand from large enterprises above 1,000 lines which are not included in the deal. While it's going to take some time for this to grow into something meaningful, I'm super excited about their capabilities to generate growth in the SMB sector in a way that will be truly incremental for T-Mobile. Okay, I want to spend a moment on something that I'm very passionate about.\nOur network, America's best network. Over the last couple of years we've seen a significant increase in the number of customers citing our network as the reason for switching to T-Mobile, and that's a great start. But the reality is most of our prospects don't yet know we have the best network. In fact, only about 20% of switchers in the broader market believe we do. This represents an enormous runway for us. Network perception has now become a major focus for us for a simple reason. There's a massive opportunity from all of those tens of millions of customers who went elsewhere in the 4G era deliberately choosing what was then the best network. Well, there's a new best network in America, and you'll be seeing us bring that message to consumers and businesses in really innovative ways.\nUntil every person in America has heard why, there has never been a better time to join T-Mobile. On the substance of our network leadership, we are on the move. We're continuously pushing across multiple strategies to widen our lead and cause the rest of the market to follow. That's why we're out there with greenfield builds, having already lit up 1,000 sites year to date, with a plan to bring on nearly 4,000 sites this year alone. That's why we were the first carrier to roll out things like nationwide 5G, advanced automated slicing capabilities, and higher order carrier aggregation. We won't stop. It's all about getting more and more performance for our customers from every capital dollar and every piece of radio spectrum. The result? Our network lead continues to widen.\nWe're also shoring up our network in smaller market and rural areas with USCellular. With all required approvals now in place, I'm pleased to say that we plan to close the transaction and become one team next week. On 1 August, we can't wait to welcome USCellular customers to the T-Mobile family. The combination gives us an expected 50% or more increase in capacity in the combined footprint, and our site coverage will expand by 1/3 from 9,000-12,000 sites. Taken together with the greenfield builds I mentioned earlier, the network experience in smaller markets in rural areas is being fundamentally transformed, just further fueling our ability to compete and grow in this space.\nJust this morning we launched our groundbreaking T-Satellite service, commercially further extending our network to connect customers in the 500,000 sq mi of this country that are not covered terrestrially by anyone and with a truly differentiated service. Okay, now let me turn over to 5G broadband. No surprise, given the strength of this product. We delivered yet another stellar quarter. In fact, for the 14th straight quarter, we led the overall broadband industry in net additions, double-clicking into it. T-Mobile for Business also led the industry this quarter, achieving our highest ever business 5G broadband net additions. Overall, both speeds and usage continue to rapidly grow, demonstrating the mainstream nature of this product. While satisfaction is as high or higher than ever as seen in our record low churn.\nLet's talk fiber. Last month we launched T-Fiber after completing our JV acquisition of Lumos in April, and tomorrow we plan to close our JV acquisition of Metronet. With both up and running under the T-Fiber banner in the second half, we're poised to deliver 100,000 or more fiber nets on top of our planned 5G broadband nets. This year we are off to the races. Let me spend a moment right now on our ongoing digital transformation. At Capital Markets Day, we shared an audacious transformation plan designed to meet customers where they are with breakthrough enabled sales and services experience, breakthrough AI enabled sales and services experiences, and a step change improvement in our business model. At the same time, I'm here to tell you that we are more than on track. Look at how far we've come in such a short time.\nA year ago, T-Life was just getting started. Our T-Life app now has over 75 million installs, and it's one of the most downloaded apps in the App Store. It's a destination for tens of millions of customers to transact and access the incredible Magenta Status benefits that they love. As an example, a year ago very few of our phone upgrades occurred digitally. Today we've checked that box. About two thirds of our consumer upgrades now occur via our app, and we're exiting Q2 with significant new momentum in digital add lines and turning next to new customer acquisition. I have never been more excited about the potential here for our customers and also for our business model. Speaking of, let's talk financials. Our best-in-class customer results continued to drive industry-leading financial growth across key metrics.\nYet again in Q2, postpaid service revenues grew 9% YoY, an acceleration from Q1, and total service revenues grew 6%, a rate well over double that of our closest competitors. Our industry-leading core adjusted EBITDA growth was 6% YoY. We delivered $4.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow, a new Q2 record, translating to once again industry-leading adjusted free cash flow conversion from service revenues of 26%. Listen, what these results demonstrate. Overall, it should come as no surprise. T-Mobile's industry-leading value proposition of best network, best value, and best experiences is an exceptional combination. Our strategy is differentiated, it's durable, and it has tons of room to run.\nNot only do we see opportunity to deliver outsized growth in underpenetrated areas like smaller markets, T-Mobile for Business, and broadband alongside smart new adjacencies, but as we solidify our network lead, we're also demonstrating that there's room to run among network seekers in the top markets where we're most established. There are growth opportunities everywhere we look. We have built these differentiated and durable advantages over time, and with unwavering focus. This team sitting here in front of you looks around corners, and we show up every single day ready to win—to win today and to win tomorrow. We won't stop. We won't stop doing what's right by customers. We won't stop shattering the very records we set, and we won't stop delivering against the lofty, long-term ambitions that continue to set T-Mobile apart.\nOkay, Peter, over to you to provide a quick update on our key financials and our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Mike. Hey, as you can see, we had a fabulous Q2, which underpins the confidence in our increased guidance. Before we jump into those updated full year expectations, I'll note they now reflect the inclusion of Metronet, but exclude USCellular, for which we will provide an update later after the close. Okay, starting with customers, we are raising our total postpaid net additions expectations to be between 6.1 to 6.4 million, an increase of 500,000 at the midpoint. Approximately 100,000 of the total will be fiber net additions. We are also increasing our expectation for postpaid phone net additions, now expected to be between 2.95 and 3.0 million, highlighting the great momentum we're seeing in the business. Both of these represent our highest ever customer guidance at this point in the year.\nWe also continue to expect strong postpaid ARPA growth of at least 3.5% for the full year as we see continued deepening of customer relationships. We now expect 2025 service revenue growth of at least 6% for the full year. We now expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $33.3 and 33.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $100 million at the lower end of the range, which includes funding our significantly increased total postpaid net additions expectation. As part of that, we expect Q3 core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $8.5 billion as we accelerate investments into our business. Turning to cash CapEx, we continue to expect cash CapEx to be approximately $9.5 billion for the full year.\nWe also expect adjusted free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs, in the range of $17.6 to 18 billion, also representing an increase of $100 million at the lower end of the range. I also wanted to touch on the upcoming close of the joint venture transaction which is acquiring Metronet. As with the Lumos joint venture, the consumer experience and residential business will be fully owned by us, and we will also share in 50% of the joint venture economics. We will treat the acquired customers as a base adjustment in our third quarter results, and as we fuel customer growth, we expect the retail business to be slightly accretive to service revenues while remaining neutral to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow this year.\nAdditionally, our 50% equity stake in the joint venture will be reported below the line as an equity method investment and is expected to be immaterial to net income this year. Next quarter, we will provide a more comprehensive update regarding the contribution of both of our Fiber joint ventures. Let me also spend a moment on the benefits from the recent legislation coming out of D.C. While this won't meaningfully impact our 2025 cash tax expectations, we do expect an approximately $1.5 billion benefit to cash taxes in 2026, which will be deployed thoughtfully, guided by our capital allocation philosophy. Finally, I want to provide an update on the sale of our 800 MHz licenses.\nWe have reached an agreement with Grain Management to divest our entire portfolio of 800 MHz licenses in exchange for a combination of $2.9 billion in cash, all of Grain's 600 MHz licenses, and have additional potential upside via participation in future proceeds Grain receives from monetizing the licenses after a minimum return to Grain. The transaction is anticipated to generate approximately $850 million in incremental income taxes following the close. As a reminder, all of the net proceeds are incremental upside to the guidance we laid out for you at Capital Markets Day last year. We expect this transaction to close in Q4 2025 or the first quarter of 2026.\nOkay, to sum it all up, not only did our results continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently execute and deliver outsized and profitable growth, but we cannot be more excited to carry our strong momentum far into the future. All right, with that, I will now turn the call back to Cathy to begin the Q&A.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Peter. Okay, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone by pressing Star, then one, and via X by sending a post to @MobileIR or @MikeSievert using #TMUS. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour first question today will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Technology Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys. Two, if I may. First, you guys saw strong sub growth in the quarter despite slightly higher churn. Could you just give us an idea, Mike, about what you're seeing in the market today, how you expect churn to sort of trend in the second half, and what you're seeing just from a competitive standpoint? Number two, thanks for the disclosure. On the fiber side, you know, 100,000 for the year. Can you give us a little more color on that? Is that sort of 50,000 run rate for the next few quarters, or does that include some that we saw here in the second quarter, and just any other color you can give us on the sort of growth of that business, either today or over time? Do you anticipate other opportunities for some inorganic growth in that business? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, terrific. Thanks for the questions. Let me start with Srini on the competitive environment, although I'll invite anybody to jump in, and then we'll turn to Mike on fiber and what we can expect for the second half. Srini, what are we seeing out there?\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, John. Quick sense of the competitive environment. Firstly, we like the fact that it's a dynamic competitive market. As natural sharetakers, we enjoy these moments when there's more movement and more switching in the market. Part of that is our conviction that the fact that we win in these moments has far less to do with promotions. It has far more to do with the compelling proposition we have. Now, I've worked in a few different telco markets and seldom do you see the kind of unicorn position where one telco or one provider is able to provide not just the best network, but also the best value, and best experience. That unique proposition is what really powers our ability to win in situations like this. Talking about the market itself, this is a market where the dynamics of competition changes and evolves.\nWe go through periods where the focus is on rate plans. Currently, we're in a period where the focus is on device promotions. The reality is, even as the focus shifts to device promotions, there's kind of more spend upfront. The CLVs we're generating are robust and pretty consistent with our history of CLVs. This feels like a really good economic investment, and we feel very, very comfortable making that investment. I mean, the driver to that is, yes, you have more outflow up front in the device promotion, but you get longer lifetimes, you get higher ARPUs. All of that comes together to make a solid, robust, and dynamic environment. We like the dynamic bit of it.\nI think the last point I'd make on that is if we just lift out of, you know, the dynamics of competition, shifting sands, how we compete, and the rest of it. The reality is this is a great time to be in the US wireless industry as a customer and as a participant as customers. In the last three to four years, we've seen customer speeds grow three to four times, data consumption grow three to four times, and at the same time, customers have paid less in real terms for the product. As an industry, we've seen a 50% growth in free cash flow, which is the one metric that really matters from a value creation perspective for the industry as a whole. It's a really good time to be in wireless, and we're enjoying the dynamic nature of the competition.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, I mean, the only thing I'd add around, John, your question around Churn is much as we foreshadowed, we anticipated Q2 to be up given the finalization of our rate plan optimizations. What we're anticipating going forward, if I think about Q3 sequentially, we anticipate it being down, and YoY, probably flat to potentially slightly up. We're through that heightened area of Churn for us, and we're seeing great dynamics now. That's probably the color around Q3.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, sounds great. I don't have much to add to that. Well said, Mike. Want to talk about fiber? What are we going to see in the second half?\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident, Marketing, Strategy and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, first of all, after a couple years of being in pilot mode with T-Fiber, we officially launched last month both in the Lumos markets, as well as our wholesale markets, our T-Fiber. You know, it's been a few weeks, and so far it's going great. You know, the thesis that we were excited about as we got into the fiber business, that our unique assets could help us penetrate markets, everything we've seen so far has reinforced that to us. The 100,000 that Mike spoke about a second ago is coming both through the two JVs, as well as the wholesale markets. The Metronet deal, of course, closes tomorrow, and we will commercially launch T-Fiber in those markets later this year.\nThe 100,000 contemplates the combination of both the JVs as well as the wholesale markets. In terms of the question about other inorganic, obviously we continue to keep an open mind as you would expect us to about that. The 100,000 is with the organic or the deals that we've closed that will all be closed as of tomorrow, as well as the markets that we've already been operating with in wholesale.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOne of the things we haven't talked about much is our overall go to market approach. I just, I love it so much, you know. We are, obviously, we're leaders in broadband. We've been the share taking leaders in broadband for 14 quarters, and now we're able to add in many places across the country T-Fiber to that. It's on an infrastructure that already exists from a go to market standpoint. We've been able to engineer an IT platform for T-Fiber that I think is just fantastically elegant because this will be a model that involves wholesale partners, as Mike just mentioned, JVs like Lumos and Metronet, and possibly future JVs, all of whom can plug into a unified T-Fiber platform incredibly easily.\nIt took us a while to get it done, but this thing's fantastic, and it really gives us terrific flexibility when it comes to our ability to do what we do best, go to market and serve customers. I'm really excited about it.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Mike. Thanks, John. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Just reflecting back on your capital markets day last September to now, one metric that really jumps out is the ARPA growth. I think you talked about 2% growth or 2% plus last year over the three-year planning period. You're up almost 5% year to date. Could you guys unpack a little bit of the drivers there and whether you're more optimistic about growth in that line and service revenue over the course of the next couple years, just given the strength that you've seen.\nI didn't think of you having doing a deal with the cable operators as a possible outcome on this call, but I wanted to ask you if you could spend a little more time on your strategy there and why you think it makes sense for T-Mobile and what the opportunity is long term around partnering with that industry going forward.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI love it. Well, we'll start with Peter on ARPA, and I think Ben's trying to be played. Are you sandbagging us over here or what's going on?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nRight, right, yeah. In the multi-year arc. What do you do? Look, much like we said at Capital Markets Day, our job is to put together a set of rational, aggressive assumptions, and then go try to beat them. I'm not here to start, you know, updating 2026 or 2027. That's not the job. There'll come a time we'll have to layer in USCellular as well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. ARPA growth is definitely going fabulously well this year, and that's the underpinnings for both the service revenue increase, now at least 6%, but also the strength there of 3.5% this year. Of course, that does have to do in part with the rate plan optimizations that we executed on.\nThat's why you see a little bit of year to date versus year to date difference versus the second half, because remember we began those late in Q2 of last year. You're kind of lapping right now the periods where we have this year the benefit of two rate plan optimization, the finalization of the first one, and the very first one. Now we'll have the real true organic growth in the second half. What really is exciting, what underpins that, as Mike highlighted in his prepared remarks, is just what we're seeing from a rate plan perspective. Customers are really appreciating the value that we're packing into the plans, combined with, of course, the best network and experience proposition, and their self select up the tiers to our most premium tier at very exciting levels. Not here to update 2026 and 2027.\nOur job is to keep this momentum going in 2025, and then thoughtfully update you when it comes later.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWe really didn't see this coming. I mean, Jon Freier and team just went out and found a way to connect customers to these value propositions. I also think it underscores that customers are reacting to the incredible differentiation of T-Satellite, which is included in these upper end plans. Whatever it is—great execution, great value proposition—it's a little bit of a surprise. I'll give you a couple stats on this. We've been talking about the 60% of our loading being in these premium tiers, but that's multiple rate plans. I said in my prepared remarks that at the high end of that, we've doubled it. What we've done is we've taken it from 10-20 of the 60, not as a denominator, so 10-20 and then another 40 more to make 60. Of the total piece, it's fantastic.\nWe didn't really see it coming, to be honest. People are moving up even within premium to more premium because they want more of what T-Mobile has to offer. I love that. Obviously, the second half we're round tripping last year's rate plan changes, so it'll be a little harder to deliver the same percentage gain. Nominally, we feel really great with where we are. You asked about cable. Quickly on cable, I had a lot to say about it in my prepared remarks, so I'll try not to repeat it. But.\nLook, I think this is just incremental, and we've chosen a segment business, SMB, where we really don't have a lot of exposure. You know, as I said, we kind of have a barbell business. We're way down in very small business, where we already compete with cable, and we tend to be growing way up in Enterprise, 1,000 and above, and we don't have a lot of market share nor win share in between. It's just a great win-win, where I think most of those revenues will come in and be completely incremental, and that's just, that's where we want to be. You know, it's not the start of something. I mean, this is a multi-year thing. I hope it grows over time to become something really big and special, but the dynamics are different.\nYou know, people are asking us, well, does this mean you're stepping into consumer or something like that? No, we're not interested in that because the dynamics are different in terms of the incrementality in our math. What we love about these business segments that we focus the partners on is it's almost entirely incremental. It's great for what it is. It'll grow over time, I think, be really productive. It's not the start of something that will open up new segments after that.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Technology Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks so much.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Sam McHugh with BNP. Please go ahead.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director, Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP\n\nAfternoon, guys. He talks about only 20% of switchers perceiving T-Mobile as having the best network, and I guess that's increased over time.What do you think you need to do to improve that? Is it leaning on advertising? What can shift that up even further? Secondly, on the Cable MBO, just to clarify. Are they restricted from selling to certain subsets of the enterprise community, and they can't sell to the super large enterprise? Is that the right reason? Thank you very much.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI'll start with the easy one. That is correct. The deal limits our partners to 1,000 lines and below, or below 1,000 lines to be specific. Let's go over, let's do the first question and talk about brand. Maybe ask for both Mike and John to talk about what it takes to convince people.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident, Marketing, Strategy and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, I mean here's the great news. Our own customers are convinced, and one of the things that we've seen happen over the last couple of years is T-Mobile customers already believe that they're on the best network. The 20% stat that you just referred to are prospective customers looking at T-Mobile and the other providers and how they feel about us. We look at 20% as a huge opportunity, you know, across every single geographic market in the US. I think it's a combination of things to make them aware of this. Yeah, advertising certainly will be a part of it.\nYou saw after our announcement last month, we did kick off a pretty significant campaign that was kind of multifaceted with both TV advertising, and you see it across our events like at the All Star Weekend in Major League Baseball last weekend. Advertising certainly will be a big piece of it. Experience will be a big piece of it. When you walk into the store or you go into the T-Life app, customers will be able to see what kinds of experiences are derived using our network. I think another huge piece of this is the network leadership that we have is not a moment in time.\nWe've known that we've had the best network for a long time. It was great to have third parties widely recognize that. This is a lead that we intend to keep and to widen. I think a big part of changing how customers perceive this is continuing to stay in the lead and expand our lead. You know, perhaps, you know, through this, Ulf can talk a little bit more about that too.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, I'll just say one thing which is, you know, Callie and team keep landing some of the most high-profile, large enterprise, and government customers in this country. They choose T-Mobile after they give everybody a try, you know, and they're choosing us because we're the best. A lot of them now are standing up as third parties to talk about why they chose T-Mobile. When you have some of the most respected brands, government organizations, and first responders talking about their choice of T-Mobile, that kind of third-party endorsement is really, really powerful.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident of Business Group, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. If I could add on to that, Mike, you know, T-Priority, we launched in Q1 of this year, and we've seen double-digit growth in new accounts with T-Priority since launch. You have the City of New York who shared the stage with us to talk about why they chose the best network. We've also seen the City of Miami Police Department, the LA County Police or Fire Department, and the City of El Paso. We're starting to see the top 10 cities and first responders say, hey, this is a network that performs on the nation's first 5G Advanced, truly nationwide 5G slice in a way that there's just no other option for us. I think that really speaks to the strength of what we've built.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nTerrific. Did we cover that one? Okay.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, thanks, Sam. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please, go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, Moffett Nathanson\n\nHi, Mike. You just talked about a moment ago. T-Satellite. I wonder if you could just dig into that a little bit, and the contribution that it had to your ARPU growth, but also how it sort of changes the way you think about serving rural markets and customer segments. It sounds like it surprised even you with the kind of impact that it had on the market.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, Craig, I just love you. I could just count on you to ask it. We launched this thing at 8 o'clock this morning, and you're wanting a business update. I love it. But you're right. I mean, in the run up to it, which is, I think, what you're, to be fair to you, what you're talking about. I think people have been choosing our higher end rate plans and anticipating this launch during the beta period. Unfortunately, I can't unpack that for you. But our highest end rate plans, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are more popular than they've ever been. I do think an awful lot of how we will wind up monetizing this strategy will be through that kind of migration and selection within our rate plans. This is available to everyone at just $10 a month. That's also very appealing.\nI can't, you know, I could be, I'm willing to be wrong on this, by the way. I mean, you know, this is a, this is speculation at this point, but I think it's going to be really a popular catalyst to bring people into that deeper relationship with T-Mobile, which is just so great for us in so many ways because the more we can have that deep relationship, not only do they get T-Satellite, but they unlock all kinds of other benefits of membership that are sticky and satisfying. So it has the chance to create this virtuous circle. You're going to have to check in with us later. I mean, once we get a little more than one day of experience. But we're optimistic that. But we're going to be able to land this as a truly differentiated service that people notice.\nNot just T-Mobile people, but AT&T and Verizon people too.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, Moffett Nathanson\n\nJust based on what you learned in the beta period, does it change your thinking about the way you deploy your network assets in very rural areas?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nNo, not at all. And in fact, part of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is we are on it. We are on the build: 1,000 sites on air so far on a plan we greenlit late last year with 4,000 total in our plan for this year. And maybe Ulf, you can talk about how we do this because we actually don't have a market by market methodology. It's informed by our AI algorithms where we build, and maybe talk about this 4,000 greenfield program that we have going on this year.\n\nUlf Ewaldsson\n\nPresident of Technology, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, Mike. Yeah, we're incredibly proud of our network, and we not only intend to stay where we are. We think we are about two years ahead of competition on our network. We actually intend to extend this lead. One of them is to make sure that every tower, every capital allocation we do go to where it matters most for our customers. The way we're doing that is something that we internally call customer driven coverage. We talked a little bit about that at our capital markets day. But it's a way where we have millions and millions and millions of data points on experiences of real customers both when they are on the network, falling off the network, and doing things on everything they do.\nWe combine that with business outcomes and business metrics, and we let AI roll around in that, figuring out so we can stack rank every capital allocation, every tower upgrade we do.\nEvery new tower that we put on the network that leads for us to a build this year, which is just incredible. As you said, 1,000 so far, we're going up to 4,000 by the end of the year, and that is even without what we're adding with USCellular. So I think it's just going to be incredible for in terms of coverage, the capacity on the network is just incredible too. I mean we are running at about 67% of our traffic on 5G at the moment. We have all that left in terms of.\nConverting spectrum over to 5G. So we have so much more room to run.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSo Craig, while we don't direct this from a strategy standpoint to be smaller markets in rural areas to the premise of your question, generally the algorithm right now is spitting out more rural areas. And so that's where most of this 4,000 build is. And by the way, the net incremental keep sites taking us from 9,000 in the USCellular footprint to about 12,000 are also principally mostly in smaller markets and rural areas. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, taken together, that's a transformational all in one year step change in our footprint of towers covering smaller markets and rural areas. And then to your point, you add on the differentiated service of T-Satellite. It's just about taking a network advantage of, and just stoking it.\nYou know, part of what I believe deeply in business is that you build a great company not just by addressing the things that aren't working, but figure out what is working and double down on it, stoke it. And right now, what's working for T-Mobile is taking share as the 5G leader in smaller markets in rural areas. And we won't stop.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, Moffett Nathanson\n\nVery helpful.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Mike. Thanks, Craig.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, Moffett Nathanson\n\nThanks, Craig.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Patner, New Street Research\n\nGreat. Thank you. So, Mike, I'm wondering if you can give us an update on how many locations you pass in the Metronet and Lumos markets at the moment and what penetration is on those assets. And then one tiny housekeeping question. I don't think you told us in the past what the cash tax expectation for 2026 was. So I'm wondering what it is now that you get the $1.5 billion benefit in 2026.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great. We'll come to Peter for the second one. Let me start with Srini, because although I don't know we'll be able to give you the point estimates, I'd love for you to talk about where this all leads us. Srini, in the fiber space. Because I think it's really important for people to understand. Yeah.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nSo look, I think the broadband space as a whole is something we're hugely excited by. We're now the fifth largest ISP. We will, as Mike said in his prepared remarks just this year, add 10,000 fiber net adds mostly in the second half of the year. It's a business as a whole that we like. It's a combination of FWA, which continues to be a fallow capacity business, as well as investing in fiber, where we like the economics. Now, you put those together and we're positioned to be a scale player in broadband because, you know, our number 12 million FWA customers. Now, you put that in terms of the equivalent, if you were to look at fiber homes passed, right? Let's assume a 40% utilization. That's the equivalent of 30 million fiber homes passed.\nPlus, we've already said on Lumos and Metronet we intend to get to 12 to 15 million households. We're becoming the equivalent of 40 to 45 million homes passed as a broadband player. That's before we go make other investments. As we've said before, we're very open to looking at investments in fiber. They need to be the right investments. We are. I think we've showed our hand on this. We like pure play fiber assets. As a whole, we really like this whole space of broadband, and we think there's a huge opportunity to drive equity value in this space. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything specifics on Metronet and Lumos right now where we are given that it's day minus one.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident, Marketing, Strategy and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, we probably can get into the details of Metronet, but one of the things that really attracted us to both companies, and we certainly have seen this at Lumos, is these companies are the best in the country at building Greenfield Fiber. There's still a lot of places left to cover in this country where you can be first to market to fiber. What we've seen so far from Lumos is they continue to be very successful at that. We're very optimistic that we'll continue to see that with Metronet after we close tomorrow.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nDuring the pendency of the transaction, Metronet also outperformed their deal expectations in terms of what they would build. We're arriving with a better penetration than we had hoped for when we first signed the deal. We'll update you on actual build expectations after we actually own the assets, Jonathan, but hopefully you can tell we're excited about the space.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nLet me, on the last question, I'm going to have to disappoint you. I'm going to resist the urge to give you a pinpoint, the cash tax estimate for 2026, and primarily because obviously there's a lot of other factors to update in there, including USCellular closing and all the purchase accounting around that, the timing of the close of 800 MHz transaction. For now, I'm going to resist it. There'll definitely be a time to give a more comprehensive 2026 update.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThe OBBB versus the not OBBB is a $1.5 billion benefit. It's great to see that coming in.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Patner, New Street Research\n\nTerrific. Okay, thanks.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nJonathan. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Gregory Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory Williams\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. First one's on your rural market share. A few years back on your analyst day, you noted a goal of reaching 20%, I believe, of the smaller markets. I think it was right around by 2025. Here we are in 2025. I'm curious what your market share is now and if it's reached that 20%, where it could go. If USCellular changes that calculus as well. Second question is just on the billion and a half benefit from the tax release bill, you said you deploy the capital thoughtfully. I was wondering if you can add more color to those words thoughtfully, whether we think about M&A, buybacks, or network investment. Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, we'll start with John. Smaller markets in rural areas. How are we doing?\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nI'm going to try to, like, contain my enthusiasm for this question, Greg.\nI really appreciate the question. First, we're unbelievably excited about smaller markets in rural areas. Just for, you know, the first time listeners here, the way we define this is everything outside of our top 100 markets. This would be 140 million people, 50 million households, roughly 40% of the US, and we're excited about it for two reasons. Number one, we have surpassed 20% share of households in smaller markets in rural areas. We have beat that goal that we set for you in 2025. We're really excited about that. This is our ninth consecutive quarter where we have been the leader in postpaid switching, and we've been on a tear on this for a little bit more than a couple of years now. We're really excited about that.\nThe thing that excites us more is exactly to the premise of your question, what the opportunity still is in smaller markets, rural areas with the addition of USCellular and all the assets, the complementary spectrum, the sell side assets, et cetera, that we will be implementing into our network and the thousands of greenfield sites that are coming into the network as well. You know, we have this huge opportunity still, like we're doing all sorts of things, as you would expect, in terms of network investment, distribution investment, community investment. We just kicked off Friday night 5G lights for the second year in a row in smaller markets, in rural areas. We're having a lot of fun with that as well, and you have so much more tailwind that we expect into this business.\nI don't think anybody ever thought that we would hit 20% and pack up our tent and go back home to New York City. We're going to stay in here and continue to drive this business to our fair share of the market, maybe even outside's fair share of the market. We'll have more to say after we close the USCellular transaction and give you a little bit more of an update in terms of what we're up to. We're incredibly excited about our progress so far and even more progress to come.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou're asking the million dollar or billion dollar question, Greg, which is where could it all go? I'd love to be able to answer that for you today. It's something we think a lot about. We don't know. I'll tell you this, our current win share, without even all the advantages that we believe we can build to further accelerate in these areas, is way higher than that 20% household share. You know, if nothing improves, you would expect it to normalize over time to a market share way higher. In places we've been successful for a long time, there are places we have market shares way, way higher than our national average. It's really about can we deliver the advantages that we think are really going to be required to be long term market leaders in smaller markets?\nIn rural areas, will our digital transformation strategy speak particularly well to people that live further away from retail? Will our ongoing improvements in network, including our merger with USCellular, make a step change in our competitiveness? Will our T-Satellite capabilities, which really only are a differentiator if you fall off our network, disproportionately benefit people who live closer to the edge of cellular networks, i.e., people in rural areas? We do not know the answers to all these. Theoretically, there are reasons to believe that over the long haul we could become more successful in this subsegment of the market than we are today in the top 100 markets. When I use phrases like room to run, I am serious about it.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, on the benefit again, the $1.5 billion question, I guess so to speak.\nWe're going to be guided by the thoughtful and very consistent capital allocation methodology that we have. Let me give you a couple ideas. One is the 800 MHz that I projected for you in prepared remarks, and when that closes, that generates $850 million of taxable expense for us. That means about a net $2 billion benefit incremental to what we laid out at capital markets day on this $1.5 billion. One of the things we're, of course, looking at as we close USCellular and can look and deeply assess all the data, is are there opportunities to accelerate? Remember what we gave you was $1 billion of synergies on a three to four year time frame with associated cost to achieve of about $2.2 to 2.6 billion.\nIs there an opportunity here for us to accelerate some of that from three to four years, pull some of that cost to achieve in and deliver even more value in NPV of those synergies? Those are the kind of things we're investigating now. It's not time to, you know, break that 2026 spreadsheet open yet and send it out my way and your way, but please. Well, we'll definitely be thoughtful about it.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIt's interesting you give those examples because they follow your long established capital allocation philosophy. Right. Peter's been very clear. We peg our leverage at 2.5. That's our current, you know, board authorized leverage, and that's where this management team wants to be. That gives us a capital envelope. Within that capital envelope, we invest first in our core business. You just mentioned maybe highly accretive opportunities in our core that we could move faster on. We invest in smart adjacencies and potential inorganic investment opportunities, and then we return capital to shareholders. We've been following this philosophy, I think, very successfully for a while. You tumble right away to some of these potential things that could allow us to unlock even more value faster for our shareholders. It's too early to tell.\nWe'll only put the money in them if they're a better idea than not.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nExactly.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Greg. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks and good afternoon. A couple questions on 5G broadband and FWA. First, just curious what you're seeing that's driving the ongoing momentum in that volume. How much of that quarterly volume may be benefiting from greater breadth of coverage versus deeper penetration in some of the existing markets? Secondly, are you seeing evidence that FWA may move from a fallow capacity model to one in which you can invest in specific capacity enhancements for additional growth and returns over time? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US",
    "content2": "Sounds good. What's moving it most of all, Michael, is word of mouth. I mean, this is the satisfaction rates of this product are through the roof. People love it, and they're pretty surprised and delighted at the performance. I mean, the average user is using like 560 GB, you know, that's up 25% from just two years ago. They're getting speeds in the 200, 250 Mb per second national average. That's up 50% from two years ago. They love the sort of the flexibility of this product, the elegance, and simplicity of it. They tell everybody when they sign up because they get this great mainstream product, and they save money. That's what's really driving it.\nI forget the second part of the question?\nYeah. You want to talk a little bit about the strategy there, Sri? Yeah.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nThe way I think of it is our center of gravity is very much the fallow capacity model. Now we're looking at whether other models work or not. One of the reasons that's our center of gravity is I think one myth is that to some extent mobile technology is static. The reality is with each passing day, especially with our 5G Standalone network, we're finding more and more opportunities to squeeze more out of our existing spectrum, out of our existing towers. There's a lot of work still to be done, but we're constantly challenging every day our 12 million number and looking at how much more we can squeeze from our network in terms of fallow capacity. I mean, just some of the recent examples like the introduction of L4S, which is low latency.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nRight.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nInnovations that we're bringing in with 5G Standalone are allowing us to squeeze more, or the work we've done on business, FWA, right, where we're finding newer opportunities to extract more out of our fallow capacity model. That remains priority one.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIt's really interesting. I mean, you know, we've been pretty clear we have this 12 million customer target in 2028. It's entirely predicated on the fallow capacity model, and we have our teams hard at work in a dual strategy. Number one, can we get more out of the fallow capacity model through all the tactics that Srini just summarized? Number two, to the very premise of your question, are there smart ways to allocate capital and get a fantastic return? Look, we don't have answers to either of those two questions, but are our teams thoughtfully working on those things? Absolutely.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question today will come from Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKutgun Maral\n\nDirector, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you. I have one high-level question. Going back to the 2021 analyst day and for maybe a few years afterwards, part of the narrative was that you were increasingly mindful of T-Mobile's role, evolving from being an insurgent to more of a steward of the industry. While you'd continue to push for competitive pressure and execute as Un-carrier, perhaps there would be a greater consideration of not only your leadership position in the space, but also the merits of helping to ensure it remains a profitable and an attractive one. Maybe fast forward to today.\nYou know, competition isn't new, but the offers in the marketplace keep getting more and more aggressive, and some of your peers are perhaps acting more and more uncarrier like. With all that context, can you update us on where you view T-Mobile as being on the insurgent versus steward spectrum? I guess ultimately, how much more runway is there to be as disruptive without the tilts and competitive postures disrupting the balance for the broader industry? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThat's a fantastic question. If you were listening to Srini a few minutes ago, I think what I take away from your comments, Srini, is that, you know, this is a highly competitive moment in time. Yes, and we like it that way. That's due to the competition that we constantly bring, as you know, the fighter brand, the value brand.\nAt the same time, one of the things you've noticed about us as the insurgent, as the net sharetaker, and value leader in this industry is that we have been remarkably consistent in how we've gone about that as the UN carrier. One of the things that Peter gets a lot when he's asked about our performance is, you know, why didn't you take more? Could you have taken more? You know, this all-time record Q2 on postpaid phone net additions is great, but why not more? What we, you know, and your answer to that has always been, we thoughtfully keep things in balance. You know, we compete and compete hard, and try to break our own records, and we bring the competition to this marketplace. At the same time, we're building a company of lasting value, a profitable company.\nYou know, that's a tone that's not new for us, that's years old at this point to the premise of your question, and that's not going to change. To your question of does this strategy have runway? Absolutely. Because it's not about anything other than leveraging long-term durable advantages built on a superior notion of what customers are looking for. They want the best network in this industry, they want it at a great value, and they want it from a company that treats them right and loves them, that delivers the best experiences, as Srini was saying. That's what we deliver uniquely, and we've thoughtfully built long-term durable advantages in these areas and keep going. You know, I've never seen a moment in our history where the strategy we're employing has more room to run than right now.\nI think we're demonstrating that as we go. The last thing I'll say is I take a little exception with one premise of the question just for fun, which is, you know, that it's that we're seeing unprecedented investment in competition from everybody right now. Look, if you add it all up right now, the financial metrics being delivered in the industry wouldn't support that. You know, T-Mobile as the value leader, for example, is delivering 26% conversion of cash against service revenues. That's just a phenomenal number and near the high end of our historic business model. We think it's, you know, a tremendous number for us as we continue to progress.\nIt shows overall, by the way, as Srini mentioned, cash flows since 2022 are up 50% in our industry while the customer is experiencing more data at faster speeds than ever before for the same real pricing. That means the customers are huge beneficiaries of the 5G revolution, but so are the competitors. The nature of competition shifting. Are there unprecedented device promotions out there? Absolutely. On the other hand, ARPUs are also higher than they've ever been, and device ownership is longer than it's ever been. These things offset each other. One way to look at it is customer lifetime values, which T-Mobile have been remarkably consistent. I hope that context is helpful.\n\nKutgun Maral\n\nDirector, Evercore ISI\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat question.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nWe'll switch over to social now and take one final question from the phone queue after. This is from Chetan Sharma. Congrats on your continued momentum with new services and network features. I was wondering if you could please provide some commentary on the interest demand you are seeing from enterprises for slicing, and what is the profile of such customers and use cases.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nShould we go over to Callie for that one?\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident of Business Group, T-Mobile US\n\nSure thing. Well, I mentioned earlier before in responding to you, Mike, about key priority and just how fantastic it's resonating with first responders in the marketplace. Since we launched in Q1, we're up double digits in growth in new accounts, which is fantastic. We're also seeing the opportunities in our beta to use T-Satellite with first responders, also with state and local municipalities who, when you think of a bus driver that couldn't get in touch with the parents when there was an emergency on the bus. This really unlocks value for both the public sector, as well as in enterprises where we start to see people use cases like oil and gas when they're out doing operations that require connectivity in places that are in that 5,500,000sq mi that are untouched by any carrier, where businesses actually do operate.\nWe see a lot of runway and potential in that space in our business. Just to mention, in Q2 overall, we think about enterprise, we think about what the capabilities of our network unlock for us. This quarter, in Q2, we led the industry and business in postpaid nets, in postpaid phone, in 5G broadband nets, and in postpaid churn. It was a really excellent quarter for us to really see the momentum, and we still have plenty of room to run. When I think about 5G.\nBroadband and the use cases for fixed wireless and enterprise, we see national retailers that are coming to us and saying, hey, a point of sale system slice as well as a fixed wireless solution across the United States is a fantastic use case. We welcomed, like Casey's General Stores is a national retailer that really needed a value provider. That also was an incredible experience for those stores. I'd also just mention, these types of solutions are helping us to deliver win share that is greater than our market share in every single segment. I'll say one more thing. You know, you heard some of our competitors talk about how, you know, they impacted in the government segment with Doge, and I don't think any of us are surprised to hear that because these are the older incumbents that have a majority share.\nFor us, what drives my business is win share. Our win share is up YoY and quarter over quarter. We're really able to sit down with decision makers, especially in federal agencies who are perhaps facing some kind of demand to lower cost or maybe have some headcount demand. When they do a bill review and they look at the value that our network provides and they look at the best network that they can move to, they're able to come up with efficacy and efficiency as they're sorting through some of the requirements that they have to manage.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI think we thought John was going to be the most excited, you know. By the way, while we're on slicing, Chetan, one thing that I think is interesting is this is a sort of a classic win-win because, you know, our network doesn't really congest, and we're the least congested network out there. We have the most capacity, like by a wide mile, and so you might think, why slicing? Enterprises nonetheless are highly interested in it because what they want is guaranteed service levels.\nDepending on the criticality of those connections, it's worth paying for so that we can guarantee them in an unanticipated situation where in the future something could cause the network to congest, that they would be able to have those service levels for mission critical connectivity that benefits them, but also in the case of first responders, benefits us all. They're willing to pay for that. That's really interesting learning. If you don't mind, on a more serious note, while I'm on it, because we were talking about T-Satellite, I just do want to acknowledge that it once again played an important role during those horrific floods in Texas a couple of weeks ago. First of all, I'm so proud of our team on the ground rushing in to help, keeping the network going. It performed beautifully.\nWe were able to transmit emergency messaging to customers, not just T-Mobile customers, but all customers via satellite that were received. Also, on the ground, over a quarter of a million text messages went out over satellite during the most critical moments of this emergency. People were able to be connected when it mattered. I'm just so proud of that and really thankful for our teams on the ground. I just wanted to shout out to our wonderful team in Texas and say thank you to them.\n\nKutgun Maral\n\nDirector, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Mike. Thanks.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOperator. We'll take our final question from the.\n\nOperator\n\nQueue and your next question today will come from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Thank you, Mike. Maybe just one question on the scale.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, US Media, Cable and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nAmbitions for broadband. When you think about fixed wireless, obviously all your peers offer it, but when you think about the wireline side of it, your peers have between 40 to 70 million kind of build ambitions or existing scale if you think about the cable companies in that mix. When you think about your goals of, say, 15ish million in wireline, why is that enough? I know you want to look.\nMore fiber opportunities, given the scale of your peers.\nWould this call for maybe consideration of some bigger transactions or bigger opportunities to scale up your network faster than you would otherwise? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, it's a great question. Maybe Srini and I can kind of take it together.\nWe're interested in ongoing transactions, but probably if the premise of your question is something like, are we interested in cable? I become decreasingly interested in that over time. I just feel like the growth is in fixed wireless, where there's value and flexibility, and the growth is in fiber because it's a superior product. That seems to be where the customer sentiment is going. We want to be where, you know, where the puck's going to be. I'm so proud of the choices we've made so far. What's driven us in these choices has been our ability to, one, deliver a fantastic product customers will love, and two, deliver a superior return for our shareholders in doing so. I want to make sure that we don't chase scale for scale's sake, that we actually chase scale because we can deliver a fantastic return.\nYou know, because our premise is a little different than some others who are on a race regardless of consequences. We're in this business to deliver a great product and make money, superior returns by virtue of our know-how and investments in mobile. That's because our premise about how this market is coming together is just a little different. You know, our view is that mobile is the considered sale, and we're going to add products to that mobile that make sense for our customers and that we can make money on. Now, as Srini explained a minute ago, our already published plans get us to knocking at the door of 45 million homes passed equivalent in wireline language through the strategies we've already announced. You know, as we've said, we have some ongoing appetite should the right opportunities present themselves at a fair value.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nThe only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is also culture, right? Which is we're about great returns, but we're also about challenging an industry for the good of the customer, and growth, right? That ethos fits very nicely with FWA. That fits very nicely with fiber. The last thing we want to be is be an incumbent. We are all about challenging an industry, about creating value for customers, about smashing customer problems. That's a big part of this calculus as much as returns is as well.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI love that it's a great place for us to end where I ended in my prepared remarks. This team right here at this table sees growth opportunities everywhere. On your behalf, we're going to be thoughtful investors in the resources of this company to go chase it and chase it ambitiously. Thanks everybody for joining our Q2 call.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Mike. That's all the time we have for questions. Thanks, everyone, for joining. We're looking forward to connecting with you again soon. If you have any additional questions, you may contact the investor relations or media departments. Thank you.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director, Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP\n\nThanks, Cathy. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes this T-Mobile second quarter 2025 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Cathy Yao, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGood afternoon. Welcome to T-Mobile's Q1 2025 earnings call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, which can be found on our investor relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Thanks, Cathy. Hi, everybody. Thanks for joining. We're coming to you from Bellevue, Washington, today. Got the whole team here. And first of all, let me welcome Srini Gopalan, our new Chief Operating Officer, to the team. And can I still say new? Because you're already making such a big impact. Srini's certainly joining us at one of the most exciting times in our history. Welcome to the team, Srini.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Mike. It's great to be here.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nTurning to our results, this was another really strong quarter, showcasing T-Mobile's outsized performance versus peers and versus the high expectations we set as well. Listen, I get a lot of questions about how we can be this consistent, even as the macro environment constantly changes, delivering industry-leading customer service revenue and EBITDA growth yet again. The answer is simple. It's that our team is relentless when it comes to execution, innovating on behalf of customers. Importantly, we are building on T-Mobile's durable advantages of the best network, the best value, and the best team's obsession with delivering for customers and for shareholders quarter after quarter. Let's start with wireless. It is all about growth, with even more customers coming to T-Mobile in Q1 this year than last year. In fact, we set a new record with our best-ever Q1 for total postpaid net additions.\nPostpaid gross additions were also a Q1 record. In fact, you'll recall that last year, 2024, our greatest growth year ever. Yet gross additions were up year over year this Q1 versus that year in every single category across total postpaid, phones, non-phones, and even 5G Broadband. This is an important indicator, showcasing that customers continue to choose T-Mobile at higher and higher rates. We also led the industry once again in postpaid phones, adding 495,000. Importantly, we did it while growing our share of households, not just in smaller markets in rural areas, but across the top 100 markets as well. Our momentum is equally strong for T-Mobile for Business, where we continued to lead the industry in both total postpaid and postpaid phone net additions while adding the most-ever customers in enterprise, a record quarter.\nSwitching back to consumer, our industry-leading value prop continues to encourage new customers to self-select up the rate card. 60% of lines on new accounts continue to load onto our premium plans. That's about double that of our current base. This contributed to postpaid ARPA growth of nearly 4%, our highest Q1 in eight years. We're not slowing one bit on the value and innovation leadership that customers love about T-Mobile. Just this week, we unveiled the latest value propositions from T-Mobile, two very simple choices that we call Experience More and Experience Beyond. Our new experience plans are the best expression of T-Mobile, offering exactly what customers are seeking today. Our new offers are designed to make it even easier for customers to compare and understand the superior value that T-Mobile delivers. Okay. Turning to broadband, I'll start with our 5G broadband offering.\nFor the 13th quarter in a row, we led the entire broadband industry in customer growth with 424,000 net additions. We achieved multiple new records, from our lowest 5G Broadband churn ever to adding the highest-ever net business high-speed internet customers. As you can see, our new pricing construct, which is aligned with our mobile offerings on good, better, best tiering, is resonating really well with customers. While at the same time, we saw our highest-ever Q1 ARPU growth in broadband, showing that the business is in a really good spot. Let's turn now to T-Fiber. With the completion of our transaction on 1 April for Lumos, we're now set to officially launch T-Fiber later this quarter, something that's been in pilot for the last two plus years.\nThis is the beginning of something great, another step on our journey of profitably serving even more broadband customers, leveraging our many go-to-market strengths, including our million-plus fixed wireless waitlist. We can't wait to close our MetroNet transaction soon to further expand T-Fiber and bring better broadband choices to more Americans. As always, our ability to take share is enabled by our world-leading 5G network, where we have the best assets and a multi-year lead. Yet we still set the pace on implementing the most advanced customer-facing technology. We're excited today to announce that T-Mobile is now the first and only carrier in the country to roll out 5G Advanced nationwide, which is enabled by our nationwide 5G standalone core. 5G Advanced is faster, more dynamic, and more efficient. We achieved a record 6.3 Gb per second download speed in a recent real-world field test.\nWe're also able to better serve our business and government customers with improved slicing and lower latency. And of course, third parties just continue to affirm our leadership with big awards coming in from both OpenSignal and RootMetrics yet again. Now, as cool as all this sounds, I want to be clear that we aren't doing these things just to see if we can. We implement the technology advancements at this pace because it creates a superior customer experience, enabling us to squeeze more customer-facing value out of every capital dollar we spend. This is just fundamental to our approach, and it always has been ever since we were a lot smaller, and it remains a core advantage today. Speaking of, we continue to rapidly roll out our beta of T-Satellite, now with hundreds of thousands of active users.\nI'm going to remind you, T-Satellite is the only mobile phone satellite network that keeps you connected automatically. No apps to open, no searching for a connection, phone pointed at the sky trying to get a message out. And most importantly, no missing messages if you leave the footprint of your terrestrial network without even knowing it. That's our goal. This is a one-of-a-kind service, and our aim is simple: to make T-Satellite just work so you are always connected and reachable, even with your phone still in your pocket.\nNow, once in a while, we break news on this broadcast, and I wanted to let you know that after gauging the incredible response from customers, including broader-than-expected interest from competitors' customers, we've set our final launch pricing for T-Satellite at just $10 a month, except, of course, for our Experience Beyond and Go5G Next plans that will include it for free. And we're going to honor this price for AT& T and Verizon customers as well, because this is the only place they can get a service anything like this, with over 550 satellites in service and can count. Commercial service starts in July, and this Gen 1 pricing will be good for at least a year for everyone. Okay. Shifting gears. We're not only innovating a network, but a big part of our exciting growth journey centers on transforming customer experiences with digital and AI.\nOur flagship digital platform, T-Life, is clearly resonating with customers. Compared to just last quarter, we've nearly doubled the percentage of our postpaid phone upgrades completed digitally, with well over half of upgrades being digital by quarter's end and growing. Our new IntentCX AI features pioneered with OpenAI are already significantly reducing the need for customers to reach out to our care team. We're solving customer pain points before they happen and meeting our customers exactly where they want. Based on these early results, the audacious multi-year goals in this area that we set out last fall appear to be more than on track. Okay. I want to come back to our underlying theme of delivering thoughtful, profitable, and durable growth. Our best-in-class customer results also translated into industry-leading financial growth across multiple metrics, again in Q1.\nOur postpaid service revenues once again grew 8% year over year, and overall service revenues grew 5%. That's a rate that is more than triple that of our next closest competitor. Core adjusted EBITDA also grew 8% year over year, double the average of our wireless peer group. We also delivered $4.4 billion in adjusted free cash flow, a new Q1 record, translating to, once again, industry-leading adjusted free cash flow conversion from service revenues of 26%, a new Q1 record and about double that of our closest competitor. We have had a powerful start to 2025. Our story is so simple, and it's consistent. We have built sustainable, long-term, durable advantages, allowing us to continue to offer a highly differentiated value proposition that's right on point.\nOur execution, our focus on customers, and on setting the standard in innovation and technology transformation are the things that continue to set us apart. We have always aimed to deliver thoughtful, profitable, and durable growth, and that's exactly what we continue to do across every area of the business, again in Q1. Let me end by saying we are far from complacent. This team right here, along with our thousands of coworkers, come to work every day and act like we are running for our lives, constantly coming up with new customer ideas and new ways to improve how we serve them, to smash the pain points that still make this industry notorious. At T-Mobile, we call this mindset, we won't stop. So we won't stop.\nAnd for those of you that are counting on us, and I know you are, I want you to know we won't slow down either. Okay. Peter, over to you to give an update on our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Moblie US\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, 2025 is off to a strong start. So let me provide an update of our expectations for the full year, with our financial guidance now also reflecting the inclusion of Vistar, Bliss, and Lumos. Starting with customers, we continue to expect to deliver total postpaid net customer additions of between five and a half and six million, of which approximately half will be postpaid phone net additions. Both of these remain our highest-ever expectations at this point in the year. We're also increasing our postpaid ARPA growth expectations to be at least 3.5% for the full year as we see continued deepening of customer relationships.\nThis is up from our prior guidance of around 3%. At the same time, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to grow at 1.5% this year, even higher than last year's growth of 1.1%. With the higher expectations for ARPA and ARPU growth, we now expect 2025 organic service revenues to grow at an even higher rate than where we guided last quarter. We now expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $33.2 billion and $33.7 billion for the full year, up just over 5% at the midpoint. Turning to cash CapEx, we continue to expect cash CapEx to be approximately $9.5 billion. Finally, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $17.5 to 18 billion, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency, and resulting in industry-leading service revenues to adjusted free cash flow conversion. All right.\nLet me also spend a moment providing some more color on the close of the JV transaction, which acquired Lumos. Going forward, the consumer experience and retail business is fully owned by us, and we also share in 50% of the JV economics. We will treat the acquired customers as a base adjustment in our Q2 results. As we fuel customer growth, we expect the retail business will be slightly accretive to service revenues and neutral to Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow this year. Additionally, our 50% equity stake in the JV will be reported below the line as an equity method investment and is expected to be immaterial to net income this year. After closing MetroNet, we will provide you with a more comprehensive update regarding the contribution of both of our fiber JVs.\nTo sum it all up, in Q1, we continue to show we can consistently execute and continue to deliver outsized and profitable growth. With that, I will now turn the call back to Cathy to begin the Q&A. Cathy?\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nPeter. Okay. Let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone by pressing star, then one, and via X by sending a post to @T-MobileIR or @MikeSievert using hashtag TMUS. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I guess two questions. Maybe I'd love to hear from Srini. I know it's been a short period of time, but you know the company well. Now that you've been in the seat, what do you think is the biggest opportunity ahead at T-Mobile?\nAnything you think the market in particular doesn't fully appreciate? And then I don't know if I can get more out of you guys on T-Fiber, but now that you've closed Lumos and you're going to start selling the product, can you tell us a little bit more about sort of the go-to-market and expectations for kind of driving that business into the base, especially the fixed wireless waiting list and your existing wireless customer base? Seems like a pretty big opportunity out of the gate here now that you've closed that. So I would love some more color on Lumos now that it's done.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Ben. Well, we'll start with Srini, and then we're going to go over to Mike Katz.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Cool. Well, Ben, thanks for that question. Yeah, it's been about 50 days in. And like you said, I'm not new to this company.\nI've been on the board for well over four years. But just some early impressions. Nothing quite prepares you for being here. It's this incredible combination of a focus on kind of smashing customer problems, huge intensity, and commitment to quarter-to-quarter delivery, but also an incredible boldness for the vision and making a step-change difference to this industry and to our performance. So I've really enjoyed my first few weeks here. To your specific question on the biggest opportunities, look, I think this company has got something incredibly special in terms of its culture of smashing customer problems. I think the big opportunity we have is taking that culture and putting that together with what we have now as easily the best network in this industry, along with the huge strides that we've made in our digital capabilities. And Mike talked briefly about them.\nMore than half of our upgrades now being done through T-Life. I think the real big opportunity is to bring together this culture, this incredible thing that we've built, along with the best network and now world-class digital technology to continue smashing customer problems in a different and more enabled context.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nLove it.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\nAnd T-Fiber, the go-to-market approach, what can we expect, Mike?\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Innovation and Experience, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. No, thanks for the question, Ben. And we agree with you. We're also really excited about this, and we think it's a big opportunity. And for exactly the reasons that you just said, the assets that we have, we think make a real difference as we get into the T-Fiber business. And Mike said that we're going to do our launch later this quarter.\nYou'll see us leverage some of these capabilities in our go-to-market approach, things like our brand and leveraging our national advertising campaigns that we already do for our broadband business today, things like on-the-ground distribution. If you look at a business like Lumos, they've never had the benefit of a big retail distribution on the ground in those markets with big customer flows coming into them that we'll immediately be able to take advantage of. The customer lists with HSI because HSI is a fallow capacity business. We do have customers, like Mike said, over a million that are sitting waiting for bandwidth from T-Mobile. Some of those customers happen to be in these Lumos markets that we'll immediately be able to serve.\nSo you're going to see us start to and begin once we do our commercial launch, take advantage of those, and bring people straight onto T-Fiber.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Innovation and Experience, T-Mobile US\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Ben.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOperator, time for the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sam McHugh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Innovation and Experience, T-Mobile US\n\nGo ahead, Sam\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\n. Okay. Let's move on to our next question.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nHead of Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThere you go. I'm in. Sorry. I was on mute. I did the classic health thing. I was saying. Hi, Srini, as well. A couple of questions. One is just on the price-ups. You managed them incredibly well last year in terms of churn, but some of your peers have struggled more recently, I think, with price-ups. So as we're looking into Q2, should we think about a pretty decent step-up in churn rates? I guess that's question one.\nAnd two, it looks like you could have gone a bit heavier on kind of marketing, promos, and trying to win customers in Q1, as we can see the strong EBITDA result. Did you hold back in the Q1? I'd love to hear your views on kind of industry dynamics. Thanks.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Innovation and Experience, T-Mobile US\n\nLove it. Well, thanks, Sam. First of all, on the pricing, what we are out there doing right now is really just completing a project that we started last year to get after some long-outdated plans, first price increase of this kind in more than a decade. And I think because of that, our customers have a lot of acceptance of it.\nI think they understand, especially since we take our time in a test-and-learn method like we've been rolling this out, we understand how to talk to them about it and explain to them what's behind it, and they've been accepting it. That's gone really well. It's only affected some customers, but it is millions of legacy rate plans. The churn artifacts that you see from that are temporary in nature. I mean, the notifications were in one queue. The bill actually changes in Q2, so you see the effects across both quarters. So far, it's coming in just as expected. Again, that shouldn't surprise you because we've been doing this in such a stepwise fashion over a period now of many months of rollout.\nAs it relates to promotional intensity, my personal view, and I'd love to turn to Jon Freier next, is that the nature of competition keeps changing, but the extent of it isn't changing the way a lot of investors think. This is kind of a misunderstanding out there. I want to be clear that overall in the industry, while it's competitively intense, the industry overall is more successful now than it has ever been. I mean, think about that. Overall industry cash flows over the past 12 months are just about 50% higher than 2022 levels, just three years prior. That's amazing. And that's on the strength of 5G. And it's not on the back of customers. Customers are experiencing three times more data and four times better speeds across the industry, not T-Mobile, than just five years ago for every dollar that they spent. So customers are getting more.\nThe industry, based on cash flows, which is, cash is king, is more successful than it has ever been, even in the environment of the promotional intensity that you're asking about. Specifically on Q1, in every single quarter, we can do more than we do, and we're guided by this discipline that allows us to go after the adds that we think are going to make the biggest long-term difference to our business so we can really serve people over the long haul. Maybe you can talk just a little bit about the competitive dynamic that we saw in Q1, Jon, and how we were able to deliver these outsized results.\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. So as everybody knows, as you can see from the release, it was just a phenomenal quarter for us, a 1.3 million total postpaid net additions, and leading in the overall gross adds across every single postpaid category.\nAnd like Mike said just a few moments ago, the competition's always changing. Sometimes you're competing a little bit more on pricing, on your traditional plans. Sometimes it's a little bit more on devices. And what you see in this dynamic is more of a promotional on devices kind of competitive intensity in the marketplace. But that's been pretty generally consistent from the last several quarters. And what we have found is customers continue to love a great product, a great value, and paired with an incredible experience. And that's why you're seeing the kind of responsiveness that you're seeing from us quarter after quarter after quarter, and not just in some of our high-growth areas, but also across, like Mike said in his prepared remarks, across our top 100 markets and across smaller markets, rural areas.\nEven in our top 100 markets, we're still growing across each one of the cohorts that we talked about in our capital markets day, where we're number three in share position or number two in share position, or perhaps even number one in share position. We're growing across each one of those categories and continuing to find ways to win, that's resonating with customers. I think a lot of people would be surprised to hear we're still gaining share in the top 100 markets versus a year ago. We're not, but some are. It just goes to the strength of the differentiation of the value proposition.\nI think T-Mobile's in a spot right now where it's more differentiated versus the competitors than it ever has been in our history, with the strength of our 5G network, all the things we're doing with T-Satellite, the Magenta Status, kind of benefits of membership, benefits that we're able to convey to people, and the day-to-day superior experience that only T-Mobile people can provide. That's showing up in all-time record Q1 customer results. My general sentiment on it is this is a great neighborhood, this industry, and T-Mobile's the best house in it (inaudible) on the EBITDA results.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Moblie US\n\nYeah. I mean, it's just, as Mike said, the question of \"Are we slowing down?\" in terms of what we could have gone and get is absolutely no.\nWe optimize every quarter, as we've long said, for the most value creation in terms of the number of nets. And Q1, much like on customer growth, much like on subscriber growth, much like on account growth or service revenue growth, was very strong from an EBITDA perspective. And that allowed us, of course, with the M&A activity as well, to increase the guide for EBITDA for the year and have confidence in delivering that guide. As you know, one of the things we're doing this year is investing for some of those amazing opportunities that we laid out at capital markets day that underpinned the 2027 guidance that we gave.\nWe see a lot of that, whether it's now shifting over to new macro site build on a network or continuing to invest in digitalization and the opportunities that that unlocks from a customer value perspective, and love perspective, and secondarily the cost elements of it. We'll see a lot more of those happen as we get into Q2 and the balance of the year. So that's kind of shaping, as I think about EBITDA, but very pleased, obviously, with the Q1 results across all the financial metrics.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Sam. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Supino from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, and thanks. Two, if I may, one on Lumos, MetroNet, and UScellular. You have a lot of future EBITDA that is coming over the next several years and not in your long-term guidance.\nYou've budgeted the cash for those excluded from your buybacks in your long-term guidance. So I wondered when and how you might incorporate those acquisitions in your EBITDA guidance. Then kind of on a parallel M&A track, I wonder if you could talk a little more about cable assets as theoretical strategic assets for T-Mobile, especially as the number of fiber assets dwindles. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWe'll turn to Peter on the first one. Maybe I'll pick up the second one.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Moblie US\n\nYeah. I mean, that's just simple. Honestly, we'll update you subsequent to as and when those acquisitions close. So both for MetroNet, as I said earlier, we'll give you kind of a bigger picture around the total T-Fiber strategy once we close that.\nUScellular, we'll give an update to the initial figures that we gave in the press release early on as and when we close the transaction. But you're absolutely right. It's very exciting to be in a position where those strong 2027 guidance figures that we gave actually excluded all of these elements of M&A. So that's something that includes some of the cash outlay. But includes the cash outlay from when we talked about the capital investment profile. Yeah.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWe'll do that just like we did it for Lumos. We closed Lumos this quarter. As you saw in our guide, we indicated to you that this will be slightly accretive to service revenues. It'll be about neutral to EBITDA this year because it's a growing business, a subscription business.\nThen overall, between that and our positive momentum on ARPA, we're seeing positive upside to our prior guide on service revenues, probably squeaking in closer to 6% than the prior guidance of around 5% based on both those dynamics (inaiduble). So second question, do we want a cable asset? It's hard to answer that one. I don't want to sort of speculate on rumors and all that stuff, but I think we've kind of mostly shown our hand here. Look, we're a growth company. I mean, we are a growth company. And so what you see is our interest in 5G Broadband that has made us the fastest growing overall broadband company in America for 13 quarters. And you've also seen us show our hand in terms of wireline internet as having an increased interest relative to other things in pure-play fiber. Why? Because it's a growth category.\nAnd we also think it's the most elegant way to serve customers. It's lower cost, it's a superior product, and it's more consistent with the way we run our company. So I can't talk broadly about rumors and speculation and all that, but our strategy is pretty clear here. And I love the hand we have because we are leaders in broadband today and tend to continue to be. And I think you'll see T-Fiber continue to play a bigger and bigger role slowly and systematically over time.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Peter. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nStock Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. Mike, it seems like churn is up sort of across the board from the wireless carriers here. And it seems like a lot of it is driven by price actions. So two questions.\nSo first of all, in the past, you've said that a bigger switching pool is good for T-Mobile because it allows you to take share. Do you still believe that's the case, number one? And number two, do you think we've pushed a little too hard on pricing? Because it does seem like you're seeing a little bit more sensitivity than I would have thought for the entire industry. Have we pushed as far as you think we can go? And then one quick follow-up. Are you guys seeing any macro pressure in the prepaid market or on the wholesale market that is starting to emerge from what we're seeing in the economy? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Great. I'll start. Maybe we'll turn back to Jon on the macro pressure on prepaid question. So overall, you're right. You saw across the industry churn was just on the margin, a little elevated.\nI think there's a number of dynamics there that probably have more to do with kind of macro questions than with competition. I think there's a certain element out there where people are in a time of uncertainty about the future, grabbing what they can afford now. So you're seeing kind of some amount of probably move forward of upgrades and switching. So churn was a little elevated for everybody, and upgrades seem to be happening at pace. I don't know if that's tariff questions or what's the economy going to look like tomorrow questions. I'd say whenever I get asked about the economy, my first answer is we're not really the people to ask. I mean, we're probably the least canary in your coal mine because people feel so strongly about this category that we'll find a way to keep paying their bills.\nBut there might be a little bit of a pull-forward dynamic happening. And of course, it is competitive out there. But as I said in response to a prior question, I think the nature of that competition just keeps changing. By the way, in the first moment when it changed, sometimes again you see a little bit of a pull-forward, and there was a lot of focus on devices over the past few months. Your question about kind of how much more of this can we take, I mean, I don't know how to answer that other than it is competitive. And again, when you look at the lens of the companies overall in the industry and their performance, it's similarly competitive because the companies overall are delivering all-time record success, certainly T-Mobile leading the way in our financial growth on things like service revenues, EBITDA, and cash flow margins.\nSwitching to your second question on, oh, and is switching still an opportunity for us? Absolutely. I think you can see that in our all-time record results in Q1 that corresponded with the question. Then what's happening in prepaid, John, and is there anything about the macro environment that might be affecting industry prepaid nets, or what are your observations? Yeah, John, thank you for the question. What's happening in our prepaid business is really great. This question that got asked last time in terms of what might be happening with immigration, and I responded, I didn't think that a whole lot was going to be affecting our business because we have a premium monthly subscription business for the most part in our prepaid segment, largely led by our Metro by T-Mobile brand. We're serving nearly 25 and a half million prepaid customers now.\nThat's turned out to be exactly the case. There's been some uncertainty out there that's affecting some transactional prepaid brands. That's more in other companies versus ours. Our business has been very, very stable in this area. As you saw that we had another quarter of growth. When you look at the last four quarters, 350,000 post-prepaid net adds over the last four quarters. This particular quarter that we just finished, nearly 50,000. Churn that's actually reduced also on a year-over-year basis by seven basis points. So we're seeing nice stability in our overall prepaid business. What's also happening when you look at any kind of delinquency rates, or payment arrangements, or anything that's happening with the consumer. None of that's really changing in our business at all. So it's very nice and stable.\nAs Mike said, we might not be the first canary in the coal mine to tell you what's happening because people find this category so indispensable. And if there ever is any kind of change and there's more of a value orientation, well, we're ready to serve customers because we know how to serve customers in that kind of an environment as well. So yeah, very, very pleased in the overall prepaid business and what we're seeing.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Moblie US\n\nAnd I think, John, you asked also about wholesale and what are we seeing there. And great question because there's obviously a lot of moving pieces in our wholesale and other service revenue component. And what we're really seeing there in the underlying trend, so there's long-expected things happening there with respect to Dish and TracFone, and those are declining as we anticipated.\nWhat we have in the underlying business, if you take away the expected Dish and TracFone declines, is actually growth. And when you take that and couple it with the other service revenue, which is really T-Ads as well as the M&A from Vistar and Bliss, we believe Q1 was really the low point for us in wholesale and other service revenue. And we anticipate then growth to continue throughout the year and probably will end full year in that $2.9 billion-ish range between the underlying wholesale growth, again, excluding Dish and TracFone, long-expected, and then T-Ads, including Bliss and Vistar and our ability to scale those.\nGreat. Peter,\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nthanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nJames Schneider\n\nStock Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nI was wondering if you could maybe contextualize the contribution you're expecting in broadband in your overall postpaid net additions for the year. Do you think you can sort of maintain this pace of high-speed internet fixed wireless additions above 400,000, and maybe give us a little bit of color on how much fiber adds you might expect once you close both Lumos and now MetroNet by the end of the year or some kind of run rate? And then as a sort of second question, want to sort of ask what environment you're seeing right now in terms of gross adds thus far in Q2. Some of your competitors have talked about an elevated gross add environment actually accelerating into Q2. I'm wondering if you're seeing the same thing. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Great. Jim, thanks. I'm going to turn to Mike.\nI mean, we probably aren't going to give you too much. We don't really guide on these metrics, but at least we can tell you a little bit about how we're feeling about it and what we're seeing on 5G Broadband and a little preview on T-Fiber.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Innovation and Experience, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. I mean, what we're seeing on 5G Broadband is just fantastic. I think the team that runs this for us has just done an exceptional job. Mike mentioned in his opening comments, 13 quarters in a row in 5G Broadband being the leading broadband provider in this category. You've heard me say this before, so I'm sorry if you're getting tired of it, but the reason for that, first and foremost, is because it's a great product. Broadband is an essential category for people, and they're not going to compromise.\n5G broadband is meeting the needs of millions and millions of customers across America. That's really what's driving the growth for us in this category. You're seeing that reflected in things like churn. Mike mentioned upfront, this is the lowest churn quarter that we've seen in our broadband business. You're seeing it in our satisfaction scores. We've long been the leader in NPS scores in our 5G fixed wireless business, and that lead is growing. We had the biggest delta between us and the other categories in Q1 that we've ever had. You're also seeing, we made some adjustments in pricing at the end of the year. Mike mentioned the ARPU gains that we had year over year. You're seeing customers like we see in our postpaid portfolio self-select into the broadband plans that offer them more and more value. This business is going great.\nIt's one of the things, like we talked about, when we first discussed fiber has given us so much confidence about our opportunity to succeed in fiber as well, because we can use a lot of these same capabilities that we've built in running a national-scaled fixed wireless business to go succeed at fiber, and I think succeed with some advantage that would enable us to penetrate more and penetrate faster into the markets where we have fiber. Getting into the specific numbers, we're not ready to do that yet. Maybe we'll save that for after we close the next transaction, but we're really looking forward to it and think we're in a great position to succeed. I think we're very much on track for the 12 million subscribers we talked about last fall by 2028 as well.\nAs it relates to your question about kind of add momentum, I'm surprised it took till the fifth question to get that. I'm going to resist the urge. I really want to tell Peter to put his spreadsheets on blast and just send them out. But last quarter, we resisted the urge to give you much interquarter color, and we're going to do it again. I can tell you a few things. One, reminder, Q1 was an all-time record in terms of postpaid net additions and gross additions for T-Mobile. We also moved up on ARPU and ARPA on the strength of self-selection up the rate card, some of the optimizations, and the overall competitive dynamic. We also moved up service revenues related to all that marginally.\nWe're defending the highest guide we've ever had on postpaid net additions and therefore phones for a Q2, even better than last year's guide, which was an all-time record year. So those are the things I can tell you. Hopefully, you can tell we're feeling great about the year. We think we're very much on track for the things that need to unfold for us to deliver our year as well as our multi-year guidance to you. But we're going to resist the urge to provide interquarter dynamics for you.\n\nJames Schneider\n\nStock Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. Let me ask the obligatory question about tariffs. Since it's likely that we'll see fairly significant tariffs on handsets coming in, how do you think that plays out in your business?\nDo you think that we are likely to see higher handset prices? And if so, will that dampen upgrade rates, or is it likely that those will be absorbed by the promotions that you and your competitors offer? And so I'm just wondering how you think about how that plays competitively. Yeah.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Craig. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty unpredictable right now what's going to happen from a tariff standpoint. Obviously, it's a moving target. We certainly understand the goals of the administration. It's not clear how much this is going to affect the handset market. I think to the extent that it does land and if it's a material thing, ultimately, I think we're going to see that the customer is going to wind up having to bear that cost.\nTaking on something big on the tariff front is just not something our business model is interested in trying to do or able to try to do. So the customer is going to wind up bearing the cost of that. And probably the dynamic of that would be a slowdown in upgrade rates, exactly to the premise of your question. And that has other knock-on effects in terms of possible benefits, and possible costs to us that we would adjust for. Add it all up, right now, we haven't seen anything that causes us to think there's any kind of material impact to our business coming either way. And obviously, if something changes on that front, our investor community would be the first to hear.\nBut right now, we don't see anything on the horizon that would rise to being material or causing us to second-guess our guidance that we've shared with you. Anything to add to that, Peter?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Moblie US\n\nNo. I think that's everything we see today, is embedded in that EBITDA guidance. Again, we've reiterated CapEx guidance, so we're continuing to build. We're continuing on all of that front. But again, as you mentioned, it is a very dynamic environment, and we continue to monitor it, of course.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Craig. Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Timothy Horan from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nTimothy Horan\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nHi, thanks. I'm interested today. They're seeing more and more subscribers using their mobile devices to replace their home broadband. Are you seeing much of that? And I know you have a new price plan out there with 250 GB hotspot.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIs that intended to maybe help that process? And I guess related to that, are there other things you can do to create almost quad-play-like services so people cut their wireline or broadband? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks. It's always been a dynamic we've seen, Tim, in the category, especially among the prepaid subsegment. So there's a pretty significant part, for example, of our Metro by T-Mobile base where their Metro phone is their only connection to the internet. And the percentages go down as you kind of move up the prime scale and into postpaid. It's always been a dynamic that we've seen. I don't have any evidence it's really changing in a significant way. But on the other hand, as people are faced with tough economic choices, and some families are, you do see that they prioritize wireless.\nThat we've seen, and we've been seeing it now for nearly a decade, that when forced to choose, they would prefer to have wireless than broadband. That's the most important connection in their life. But I'm not seeing a sort of secular change in the dynamic there so far.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Tim. Okay. Let's go over to social. We've got a question from Roger Entner for Kelly. Could Kelly talk about the T-Priority progress, and what do we expect for the year?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, thanks, Cathy. And hey, Roger, thanks for the question. Look, I'm seeing that T-Priority is one of the most exciting growth opportunities ever for T-Mobile for business. In fact, we just delivered the all-time best-ever quarter for first responders with T-Priority. And I'll tell you, our growth is happening across the country in smaller markets in rural areas, and top 100 markets.\nWe welcomed the City of Las Vegas. We welcomed the police department. We welcomed Oklahoma City Police Department and so many more. In fact, it was the best quarter for new account growth with first responders as well. Our funnels are up 50% year over year, and it really is a pretty fantastic solution for first responders. I'll remind you guys, it is the only truly nationwide slice available for first responders on a 5G Standalone Core architecture. So we're seeing double the capacity, two and a half times speed, and the priority and preemption, along with the most availability and the most reliability, really resonate with our first responder customers. I couldn't be more excited about it. Thanks for the question, Roger. Okay.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Kelly. We'll go back to the phone now. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Greg Williams from TD Cowen.Please go ahead with your question.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. You spoke a little bit about cable M&A, and you mentioned pure-play fiber and you being a growth company that would be your focus. But there's media reports out there that are saying you could be presumably passing on the Lumen fiber-to-home assets at what could be a fairly attractive price. So you guys have that $20 billion disposal capital envelope. Just curious to hear your thoughts of that type of M&A and that sort of size of a deal to augment your T-Fiber business. Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. I mean, we don't really have anything new to report here. What I've been saying for a while is that we are interested in the space. We're out there kicking the tires. Our appetite is limited, and it has to be just the right thing.\nWe've kind of shown our preference for pure-play fiber. It doesn't mean we're going to limit ourselves to that, but we've shown our preference for that. We also love the strategy that we've already unveiled. I mean, if you think about our fixed wireless product moving to 12 million, our Lumos and Metronet moving to 12 to 15 million homes passed on top of 12 million customers, that's a pretty substantial footprint already. And it allows us to be choiceful. If there's things out there that we think could really add value and that we could derive a great return for our shareholders like we have in these first two where we predict IRRs in excess of 20%, then we'd be interested. And probably the simpler, more elegant, and more pure-play, the better, but it's not a hard and fast rule.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. Thanks, Greg. All right.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWe'll go back to social. This is a question from Chetan Sharma for, probably, Ulf. Congrats on a great quarter. Could you please give us some insights into how slicing usage is growing across different applications and industry segments?\nYeah. Ulf, and then maybe Kelly. Go ahead, Ulf.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, Chetan, for the question. And as you know, the network team and the company went all in with 5G from the beginning. We had a standalone core already back in 2020 launched. And in 2023, we started to play around already with network slicing. We started in sports events because it's a great way to show that it really works. We did it for PGA Golf. We did it (inaudible) Slice. We can do critical communications for the events on a network slice. All of that has led us in 2024 to industrialize this much more.\nI think one of the best examples of this is, we launched a security slice where we can tie SIM security all the way through a slice into the network core. As Kelly mentioned earlier, the T-Priority is probably the best demonstration of how well this really works. Much more to come. We can see several use cases that are coming up in healthcare, manufacturing, and in retail, where slicing provides the network experience that people really want. And all powered by our formidable 5G network end-to-end with standalone core.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nKelly.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst",
    "content2": "Well, that was very well done, Ulf. I didn't take you out on the road.\nI just was going to mention, when it comes to a broadcasting slice, we announced this past quarter an interaction that we had with Walt Disney Studios where we provided private 5G and a network security slice where they were able to broadcast from remote locations to their studios real-time. And that was on Lilo & Stitch. That was a very cool use case. T-SIM Secure, we literally have tens of thousands of SMB customers that are signing up for T-SIM Secure when they don't have a sophisticated IT department, for instance. This is a really fantastic use case for them. And point-of-sale systems have become fantastic ways for people in sports and entertainment to make sure that they cut down on long lines, that they provide security, and that the fan experience is just the ultimate experience with our point-of-sale slice. So yeah, it's been really, really great momentum.\nI think what I would say here is we're just getting started. I mean, T-Priority has been the most scalable and, I think, really nailing the pain point and the use case on the head. But we're just getting started here.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nTo that just-getting-started point, one of the things we announced today is that we're nationwide with 5G Advanced. That makes the slicing capabilities easier. Because in the early going, part of the challenge with slicing is each implementation is kind of a bespoke program. Now we're moving into the phase where we can automate implementations for our customers, which just opens up the TAM considerably for us on the kinds of opportunities that Kelly and Ulf just talked about. So we're very excited about this moment. Okay.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks. We'll go back to the phone queue. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. So Mike, just in terms of the fiber question, I think all of us are trying to basically figure out why 12 to 15 million is the right number. I think in the past, you've described this as more of a funneling mechanism, fixed wireless being top of the funnel, and you're funneling people or upgrading people to fiber at some point. But if you end up with 12 million, then 15 million fiber passing just seems inadequate broadly, just from a long-term path perspective. So it would be great to get your thoughts on why 15 million is the right number for fiber.\nThen, Peter, when we think about the fiber business and the impact on the P&L longer term, I appreciate that you may not want to give us the details right now. But directionally, if we think about the business, initially, there might be some fixed payments you have to accrue to the JVs even before revenues start kicking in. So directionally, do these businesses become a drag initially, and then over time, they essentially start contributing and become accretive? How should we think about the framework over the next two or three years? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, Kannan, those are two great questions. First, on the question about fiber. Your question really goes to our why. What is our why? Why are we doing this? And I'll just kind of return you to our general premise here is actually pretty different than the premise that some others have in this space.\nTheir premises are really based on the deep interplay with all the other products, so-called convergence. For us on fixed wireless, there's some of that, obviously, that opportunity. But the much bigger question for us is whether or not we can, based on our know-how and our embedded investments and our big customer base and our 5G network and our data and our strength of our brand and our distribution, whether we can just quite simply, on its own, make a superior return in wireline fiber than a purely disinterested financial investor could. We think we can. Those first two transactions, we unveiled that we do see very strong IRR potential overall. It's just kind of different than the premise that I think others have in the space. It sort of showcases why we have the preference. Srini, you're a global expert in this space.\nYou've seen the perspective both from the US, from Europe. Maybe you can comment on your views on convergence and how our strategy is a little different here at TMUS. Yeah.\n\nSrini Gopalan\n\nCOO, T-Mobile US\n\nSure. Thanks, Mike. So just picking up from where you left off, we normally tend to refer to convergence as a significant shift in consumer mobile buying behavior, where they move to buying wireless products from their wireline provider. And that's the thesis of a few players here. As you said, our thesis on how this market evolves is different. Let me give you two or three data points that kind of support where we stand on this. The first one of those is more than 85% of the US, for over five years, has had the option of buying wireless from their wireline provider.\nNow, to the extent that they've chosen to do that, that's built into our run rates. I think the second piece is behind this thesis of convergence is this story that somehow convergence is inevitable in the US like it was in Europe. Now, there's a flaw in that theory. It isn't inevitable in Europe. Some of the biggest European markets, whether that's Germany, where I recently worked in, or the UK, have convergence levels that are lower than the US. And that happens because whether this change in consumer behavior or not happens or not is down to market-specific things. And you look at the US, the extent to which we have family plan bundling in wireless. I mean, the US is probably the only market I know where wireless churn is significantly lower than wireline churn, which tells you something about the quality of those wireless relationships.\nYou put all of that together, and that's why our thesis on convergence is different. That said, we see a significant opportunity to make equity-enhancing investments in fiber. And so the question for us is always going to be, what's a good investment in fiber versus whether it's big enough? And that's the difference in questions we're answering, I think.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. And well said. And I think to the very specific question you asked about the 12 to 15 million, I hate to give an unsatisfying answer, but it's sort of it depends. We're going to follow the capital allocation strategy that Peter has laid out over and over again. And to the extent that we see opportunities based on all of our strengths, embedded capabilities, and know-how to make a superior return and therefore deliver you, our shareholders, with a superior return, we're interested.\nThat may not mean that 12 to 15 million is where we end, but it's certainly taken the first two JVs plus our wholesale partnerships where we think we're totaling to with the transactions already decided on. We'll see where the future takes us on this one.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Moblie US\n\nYeah. As you were asking Kannan about the long-term growth and how do these play out, I won't speak to MetroNet yet. It's not closed. It wouldn't really be appropriate for us to do so. But as I think about this, first off, on the Lumos JV, there are no fixed payments. We aren't saddling ourselves with fixed payments. All of this is funding accretive growth.\nAnd that's the exciting part of all of this: whether it's in the JV itself, the InfraCo, which is going to continue to grow, in the case of Lumos as well, to pass a significant number of households. For us, it's about customer growth, funding subscriber acquisition. So that's what we're investing in right now. And as you think about what that returns from a value proposition into the longer term, that's what we're doing here. It's not just funding today's growth. It's funding the growth of T-Mobile beyond 2027 even. How do we set this company up to be a high-growth company many, many years beyond just the Capital Markets Day that we gave? So it's important, I think, to think about these structures because of the way we did them as cash-generating structures. We talked about MetroNet in particular.\nIn the case of the current plan that we put into the press release as the case for this, we are already going to be seeing distributions back before the end of that 2030 period and the six and a half million households pass there. But all of this is funding strong value-accretive customer acquisition and creating great long-term value creation for T-Mobile.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Peter. Thanks, Kannan. Operator, we have time for our last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead with your question.\nHi, guys. Just one from me following up on the fiber discussion. Does it matter where the fiber locations are to you?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIs it a matter of sort of building fiber in markets that don't have fiber today, or is it more important for you to have markets in big growing cities, which might also be markets where you need mobile capacity at some point in the future? And yeah, would love your thoughts. Given that you can get better returns on these assets than disinterested independent operators, would love your thoughts on market structure. Does it make sense for you guys to deploy fiber in markets that might have two players already, or would you stick to two-player markets? Thank you. Thanks, Jonathan. Let me try to simplify it. The shortest version of the answer is not really. In other words, geography is not one of the primary inputs into our thought process on this.\nThe reason for that is that so far, based on our experience in fixed wireless and in our pilots of T-Fiber, there's a strong industrial logic for both places where we're highly penetrated and where we're less penetrated. The obvious industrial logic kind of speaks to itself. Where we're highly penetrated, we have more embedded advantages and therefore less friction. Where we have less penetration, we have more upside. It can be a great front door. We're just pretty open-minded on that front. Part of it is, if you look at our high-speed internet business in 5G, it's geographically distributed all over the country because it really isn't about marketing in one city or another or in a rural area versus a suburban area.\nIt's about finding pockets all across this country of capacity where no normal amount of mobile usage anytime soon will take up our capacity and where we approve applicants for fixed wireless. So that's our fallow capacity model. And since it is so widely geographically dispersed, the natural synergies don't inform the decision as it relates to geography. And based on that, I forgot your second half of your question already. What was it again, Jonathan? It was about geographic. Are we going to go into places with two existing fiber players or two broadband players? Yeah. I mean, our intention is to move quickly and for the majority of our work to be first to fiber. And that's where the returns are best. That means there's probably a cable operator. There may be fixed wireless available in that area.\nBut our intention, generally speaking, is to be first to fiber.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. Thank you, everybody. That's all the time we have. We're excited to speak to you again soon. If there are any further questions, you can contact the IR or media departments.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile's Q1 2025 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cathy Yau, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGood morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call we will make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, our earnings release, Investor Factbook, and other documents related to our report, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP. Results discussed on this call can be found on our investor relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, thanks Cathy. Good morning everybody. My senior team and I are coming to you from New York today, ready to close the books on a fantastic 2024 for T-Mobile. Before we start, I'd like to first express that our thoughts are with everyone affected by the devastating California wildfires. I want to thank our team members who worked tirelessly to keep Californians connected. Our network held up very well during the emergency, restored to 99% within a few days thanks to advanced network self-optimizing technologies. In addition, we activated T-Mobile Starlink satellite-to-cellular capabilities on an emergency basis, allowing customers to send hundreds of thousands of texts and receive emergency alerts via satellite even from affected areas. As we speak, our people remain on the ground engaging in community support, and we'll continue to do what we can to help.\nOkay, let's shift to those fantastic 2024 results which I know you're all eager to hear about once a year. At the end of the year we have the opportunity to widen the aperture a little bit. And let's start with growth. In 2024, more customers than ever before decided to join the Un-carrier. We delivered our highest ever postpaid phone gross additions. We also saw our best ever postpaid phone churn. In fact, 2024 marked our third straight year of more than 3 million postpaid phone net additions. Now sometimes I get asked whether our greatest growth years might be in our past. So I want to be clear. In our storied growth history, 2024 was our greatest growth year ever across multiple metrics and we finished strong. In Q4.\nWe once again led the industry in postpaid phone net additions with 903,000, growing our share of households year-over-year across both the top 100 and smaller markets in rural areas, while leading the industry in postpaid switching share. At the same time, we continued to deepen our relationship with customers and meet them where they want us to be. Many are taking the opportunity to self-select up the rate card. In Q4, we continued to see over 60% of our new customers selecting our premium plans, and we grew our postpaid ARPU at the highest rate in over seven years. As you know, a big part of our growth trajectory centers on tapping into digital to transform customer experiences, and we're already seeing great results from our efforts in this area, and one example is our flagship digital platform, T-Life. Customers are loving it.\nWe said we'd see 40 million downloads by the end of the year, but we saw more than 50 million and with some incredible engagement numbers. And we aren't just delivering industry-leading growth in consumer mobile; we're also doing it in business. In Q4, we delivered our best ever quarter in phone net additions and saw our lowest ever total postpaid churn, driving our 10th consecutive quarter in positive port trends across every part of the T-Mobile Business Group. An example of this momentum, I'm excited to share that the City of New York awarded us with a significant contract which includes services for the city's public safety network. Look, there's no city in the country with higher standards or more complex needs than New York.\nGiven our differentiated ability to deliver network capabilities, including our groundbreaking T-Priority service that I first unveiled to you at our Capital Markets Day. It's no wonder the City of New York chose the T-Mobile network to keep their team connected. Speaking of network, third parties continue to affirm our leadership. In January, Opensignal named us the winner in all five overall network experience categories, and Ookla once again recognized how our network outperformed others across the country by a lot. I promised you that we would not just defend but we would further extend T-Mobile's 5G network leadership for the long haul. That is exactly what we're doing.\nLet's hit on growth some more, this time turning to our 5G broadband offering. We captured our highest ever share of industry nets once again this year, and in Q4, for the 12th quarter in a row, we led the industry in broadband growth with 428,000 net additions. We also updated our pricing construct, allowing us to compete for the most price-discerning customers while simultaneously creating opportunities to self-select up the rate card to more feature-packed plans. In fact, in Q4, we delivered our highest year-over-year broadband ARPU growth, and we did it while simultaneously winning customer hearts with superior value. That is a great formula. Our story is simple, and it's consistent. We have sustainable long-term structural advantages allowing us to continue to offer the unique combination of best network, best value, and best experience. We have lots of room to run.\nLet me be clear, we are not chasing growth for growth's sake. In fact, we're focused on delivering thoughtful, smart, and profitable growth, and that translated to industry-leading financial growth in 2024. In Q4, our postpaid service revenue grew over 8%, a rate more than double that of peers. We saw core Adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% in the quarter and 9% in the quarter for the full year, continuing to lead the industry by a wide margin. For the full year, we delivered our highest ever diluted earnings per share paired with our highest ever free cash flow of $17 billion, generating industry-leading cash flow conversion from service revenues of 26%. This outsized cash generation has allowed us to return a cumulative $31.4 billion in total returns to our shareholders through year-end just since we launched our program in 2022.\nThe stellar year we just delivered along with the strong Q4 exiting momentum sets us up extremely well for 2025. In fact, we're starting 2025 with our highest ever beginning of the year guide for expected postpaid net addition. In addition, we're increasing our service revenue growth expectation for 2025 versus what we shared just a few months ago. Peter's going to share our detailed guide in a minute, but it's clear that 2025 will be an exciting year that should outperform prior growth expectations while also setting the table for 2026 and 2027 with important network investments and transformation investments. Also, I am pleased to say that the next time we do this Srini Gopalan will be here at the table with us as our new COO. You may have seen our news on this Monday about his appointment starting 1 March 2025.\nAs we get deeper into our Challenger to Champion plan, arguably the most exciting chapter in our history, I decided now is the time to return to having a COO at T-Mobile so I can have a left to right operating partner and therefore focus even more of my time on our longer term opportunities and strategy. Srini is the right guy, and one of the reasons for that is he is well known to all the rock stars here at this table. I can't wait to see his impact. Let me wrap up by expressing pride in our incredible team who produced these powerful results. This is a team who sets out to do hard things and is full of ambition, and often we actually even over deliver on those ambitions.\nOur 2024 results speak for themselves, but what I'm more excited about is the clear-eyed strategy we have for the future and the momentum running into 2025 that should allow us to not only deliver strongly this year, but position us even better for 2026, 2027, and beyond. This team is laser-focused on consistent execution and value creation both for the short-term and the long-term, and I have never been more excited about what's ahead. All right, Peter, over to you to provide an update on our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, thanks a lot Mike. As Mike already mentioned, we delivered industry leading results in 2024 and that momentum is carrying on through 2025. So starting with customers, we expect to deliver total postpaid customer net additions of between $5.5 and 6 million, our highest ever beginning of the year guide. We expect approximately half of that total to be postpaid phone net additions also representing our highest ever beginning of the year outlook. The strength we've seen in our service revenue growth underpins our expectation to now deliver approximately 5% growth in service revenue for the full year, up from the 4% we indicated during our capital markets. As part of that service revenue growth is our expectation for postpaid ARPA growth of around 3% for the full year.\nAs we see continued deepening of customer relationships and continue to find opportunities to optimize our rate plan structure, we will intentionally leverage the strength in our top line to both fund our highest ever beginning of the year total postpaid net customer additions expectations and also bolster investments across our network and digital capabilities, not only to deliver on 2025, but continuing to set up momentum against our multi year guide. In line with what we told you in September, we expect Core Adjusted EBITDA to be between $33.1 and 33.6 billion for the full year, up 5% at the midpoint. Turning to cash CapEx, we expect cash CapEx to be approximately $9.5 billion as we outlined for you at our capital markets day, fueling the investments to not only maintain but extend our network leadership.\nFinally, we now expect adjusted free cash flow including payments for merger-related costs in the range of $17.3 to 18 billion driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency, resulting in industry-leading service revenue to free cash flow conversion. To add some more color on this, this includes an expectation for 2025 cash income tax payments of approximately $700 million based on current tax policy and increased cash interest payments of approximately $3.9 billion as we continue to maintain our prudent 2.5x leverage target on a growing core Adjusted EBITDA. I want to be clear that none of this contemplates the impact of our announced and pending M&A. We remain on track to close our outstanding transactions between early to mid-2025, and we'll provide additional information after they close.\nLooking back, 2024 was another strong milestone year that continued to highlight our consistent execution, delivering industry-leading growth once again, and we are so excited for the long runway. We have to further deliver profitable growth growth in the years ahead. With that, I will now turn the call back to Cathy to begin.\nThe Q&A. Cathy: Okay, let's.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGet to your questions. You can ask questions via phone by pressing star, then 1, and via X by sending a post to TMobileIR or Mike Sievert using TMUS. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe first question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat.\nThanks and good morning guys.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nMorning.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nMaybe first on the, hey Mike, on the guidance the 5% service revenue growth and Peter, I think you sort of teased it out a little bit, but are you assuming faster postpaid service growth or sort of less of a slowdown on the wholesale side? Because wholesale obviously grew sequentially, which surprised us this quarter. So maybe a little color on what's going on in terms of the piece parts there and then on the postpaid sub guide?\nI'd say the guidance sort of goes against the narrative that we're seeing slowing growth in subscribers. Can you talk about your confidence against that dynamic to put up these type of numbers, and is it driven more by sort of changes in gross adds or potentially better churn as we look out into 2025? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. Well, I'll let Peter start with the revenue guide, especially compared to what we saw a few months ago. And then maybe I'll start on the postpaid subscribers and see who else wants to jump in.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nPerfect. Thanks, John. So, yeah, your question around wholesale. So remember, what's happening in wholesale has long been foreshadowed and planned for us. And particularly what's happened with, as we anticipated, both TracFone as well as Dish as they build their own network and offload off of our network, that we would see the tapering of those two ultimately going to zero. And what we foreshadowed at capital markets days is that 2025 would be the low point for wholesale revenue and with growth thereafter because underlying those two things planned to come off, there's growth in the wholesale base for us. So I'd expect probably the exit rates being very similar to what we'll see throughout 2025.\nAnd so to that point you're making, it really is both a function of growth in customers on total postpaid customers, as well as postpaid phone customers, as well as that deepening of the relationship that drives ARPA growth. We just delivered just over 3% ARPA growth in a very successful 2024 and expect 2025 to look the same there. And that's fueled by all of those growth opportunities that Mike talked about across every single business sector that we have.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nHas slow wholesale decline, slowing ARPA growth picking up. The guide on subscribers is the third component which you asked about. Look, as you look across our subscriber outlook, there's just not an area that's doing anything other than outperforming prior expectations. You know, I talked about in my prepared remarks that we're gaining share in the top 100 markets, a place where a lot of people felt we would just defend.\nWe are gaining share rapidly in smaller markets, in rural areas, an area that represents more than 40% of the country. We're experiencing our best quarters ever and gaining share rapidly in T-Mobile for business, fueled by all kinds of things, including our groundbreaking T-Priority offer and other related 5G Advanced services like network slicing capabilities that are now starting to demonstrate that they allow us to unlock market share gains in highly CLV positive ways. And so when we look across the board, this formula of best network, best value, best experiences, it just doesn't have a weak spot right now. And so we looked at it and said, you know, it's time to tune up that guidance as we enter the year.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, John. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks.\nGood morning. You kind of just touched on it, but I wanted to ask you a bit more about sort of the mix between kind of ARPA growth and account growth you called out in the deck this morning. Sort of fewer standalone I think fixed wireless net adds and maybe more selling into the base and more bundled customer growth, which is driving such strong ARPA growth. Is that a function of your sales and marketing strategy or just how the market markets kind of evolving at this point in fixed wireless? And then I'm just wondering if you. I know it's not a huge check for T-Mobile, but I thought the Vistar acquisition was an interesting one, and you talked about T-Ads back at your capital markets day. Why is this business interesting?\nWhat does it tell us about your ambitions kind of in advertising and sort of the digital out of home space? Thanks so much.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. Well, let's start with the ARPA growth. I'll turn to people. Peter.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, I think specific to your question around high speed Internet and account growth, we saw continued very strong account growth in Q4 of this year. To the question of what happened relative to last Q4, every quarter we see a little bit of ebbs and flows in terms of high speed Internet and are those high speed Internet only accounts as an entry into T-Mobile that we can then sell into other connected devices like Postpaid, or are those existing customers taking it? That relative mix changes quarter to quarter. In Q4, we saw strong demand for our high speed broadband product from existing customers. Still had lots of new to T-Mobile customers come in, but that just drives it. That will change quarter to quarter.\nRemember, at the same time, what we did was drive the highest ever year-over-year fixed broadband ARPU growth. So it's a fabulous result of what we've seen and what's been done from a rate plan introduction perspective there. And that underpins the sales overarchingly. ARPU is driven by both that; it's really growth across all of those vectors. We talked a little bit about consumers continuing to self-select up the rate plan in our postpaid phone constructs. We see great momentum in high speed broadband, and we see great momentum across all of our other products as well. And that's given us the confidence to continue to see and guide on ARPA growth as significantly as we have in 2025.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, add a couple things to that. You know, everything that's happened with High Speed Internet and account growth is as we forecasted for you and outlined. You know, we had talked early in the year about settling into a pattern at this level of growth on HSI versus a prior pattern slightly higher when we were much smaller. We're in the 400s now per quarter, the last couple quarters versus the 500s last year. That has a small effect on the overall account. I want to underscore, though, that this account growth is by far the highest reported in the industry. This trend of kind of feeding on just selling into the base is something you're seeing from others, and you see that in their disclosures about a decline in account growth year-over-year pretty significantly.\nWe're much higher in reported account growth, and that's because we're the share-taking leader in mobile by far. Share of port-ins, overall switching share, that's a really important trend as it relates to ARPA, in addition to the other sort of tailwinds that Peter talked about. I mean, we do have an ongoing opportunity to address legacy rate plans across the base. You know, we began a program last year on this, we didn't complete it. There's more opportunity this year, and I want to be clear that anything that we might do in this space, we will do in a way that really honors our brand value proposition, that we will be the best value, and that means the lowest prices of the majors in this industry.\nGiven that context and that focus and that brand look, there are legacy rate plans out there that are very outdated that we still can address at scale. We began this program last year, it went very successfully, and we'll continue it this year. That's another potential tailwind for us as we address those outdated plans. You asked about Vistar. This is really exciting. Maybe I'll ask Mike Katz to start.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Strategy, and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, thanks.\nYeah, man. We are really excited about this acquisition, first and foremost because Vistar Media is a great company, and it has a really incredible and impressive leadership team that we're excited to have join T-Mobile and have built out an industry-leading technology platform. Excited about the company itself. What we're really excited about is the opportunity to transform an industry. You know, if you think about out-of-home advertising, there hasn't been a lot of change in this industry really and maybe for.\nYou know, a lot of this, if you think about how advertisers think about the outdoor industry, it's really difficult to understand who's seen these ads. It's very difficult to understand if a customer has seen the ads, what they do afterwards. We think we can take this technology platform that Vistar has built, combined with the customer intelligence that T-Mobile has, and bring new features into outdoor advertising that can transform the industry and bring things like measurability and impact to an advertising platform that hasn't had them before. I can tell you, because T-Mobile is one of the biggest advertisers in the country, this is exciting for.\nUs, and I think it's going to.\nReally exciting for other advertisers. I could not be more excited to get this started with these guys.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI don't want to overstate things, but this is a big piece of our ambition that we shared at Capital Markets Day. You think about the digital outdoor place based media industry right now, it's about a $10 billion TAM. We think it has the opportunity to grow rapidly and take share from non-digital. Look, our dream here is to transform it like we think we have the capability to transform the digital play space media industry. It's a big one because we will be able to make it addressable for the first time ever. It's just been, you know, put your brand out there on a big piece of vinyl or a big flashing screen and hope for the best.\nWe can give marketers insight into how that media performed, who saw it, what they did, and we can even in close quarters like bus depots, retail media networks, change what is shown based on who's present. We can do all this with the explicit opt-in permission of customers to make their digital lives and their advertising lives more relevant to them. This is a great opportunity. We think it's transformational, and it's part of a large focus on becoming a leading for marketers by marketers advertising support service.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Ben. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking my question. As you open the aperture of your broadband business to include fiber this year and going forward, how are you thinking about the overall broadband environment we're stepping into this year from a net add perspective, and also your ability to either take price on your high speed wireless product or to potentially segment the market with different price tiers across fiber and high speed Internet, especially relative to cable competitors. Maybe secondly on the capital allocation front, how are you thinking about the potential pace of buybacks you can execute in 2025 in light of some of the cash needs you have to close the acquisitions you mentioned in the first half. Are you going to keep that ratable or be potentially a little bit more opportunistic throughout the year? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. Well, let's start the second question with Peter, then we'll come back to fiber growth.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAbsolutely. You're right. 2025 is exciting from all the NX acquisitions that we have, as well as JV partnerships. UScellular, Metro, NetLimos, all of those were contemplated in terms of the authorization that we came up with as the board did and communicated the up to $14 billion in 2025. All of that is contemplated within there in terms of pacing. I'd anticipate 2025 after, you know, we saw some things and learned some things and adjusted how we approach the marketplace from a share buyback perspective in 2024, 2025. I'd expect it to be probably more ratable during the course of the year as we think about it and approach.\nShareholder returns\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nas it relates to the broadband growth picture. First of all, I would just say it's not that big of an input to our algorithm. In other words, the rate of growth of the market is much less interesting to us than the rate of share taking because what we've been doing, the vast majority of people that sign up for T-Mobile 5G broadband are switching from something else. That goes to the second part of your question, which is making sure that we have a priced construct that is very competitive. One of the things I said in my prepared remarks is we actually made some changes in Q4 that allowed us to compete for the most price discerning customers. What's interesting is we did that while realizing some of the biggest gains in broadband ARPA that we've ever seen.\nWhat we've done is created a construct that addresses the value shopper, but also shows them that there's even more value if they trade up our rate card. So far that's going really well, and we have more opportunities to continue to deepen ARPU, not just within the core broadband service, but with associated services as time unfolds. We're very optimistic about the revenue trends on this business.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Jim. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning everybody. Question on your wholesale philosophy, I wondered, as you look at wholesale opportunities over the next couple of years, MVNO opportunities, what's the philosophy you bring to the opportunity to bid for and your thinking about how to price those bids as new opportunities come up. In fixed wireless, I wondered if you could talk about your strategy in cells that have become more highly utilized and where you continue to see high fixed wireless consumer demand.\nThanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nFirst, on wholesale, it's a pretty straightforward algorithm. We look for partners that are able to go after audiences in a better way than we can go after them with our existing brands. Brands have a certain amount of pliability, but there are audiences and pockets of opportunity out there that partners are better positioned with an alternative brand to go after in a cost-effective way. That's what we generally look for as it relates to pricing. The algorithm is to get a great return on our network. When you take out the cost of caring for customers and acquiring customers, and you look down at essentially the margin stream we get per unit of capacity on the network, we want it to be attractive at a wholesale level, not just at a retail level.\nThat's generally the algorithm that we use as it relates to capacity on fixed. Let me just remind that what we try to do in our business model is to avoid the situation that you talked about, which is certain sectors of certain towers becoming congested due to fixed wireless. Remember, what we do when approving applicants for fixed in the first place is we study our algorithm right down to the hex bin level, you know, 165 meters across, and look at not just the capacity available now, but the capacity likely to be available for years to come with normal amount of share taking on mobile in that sector, as well as normal amount of mobile usage gain. If the algorithm says that that sector will continue to have excess capacity, then we approve an applicant for home broadband.\nWith that algorithm, we are by far, for 12 quarters in a row, the leading home broadband growth provider in this industry, with more growth than the rest of the industry combined. It works really well. When it's working correctly, we don't see sectors or towers become saturated due to fixed wireless.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Peter.\nOperator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey guys, thanks for the questions. I can't believe it got to me before we had to mention that the Saturday Night Live ad was kind of incredible. I thought that was a win.\nI guess one question for Peter. Peter.\nThis is an amazing guide. Thank you for all the updated information. There's a lot that's happening. The Vistar, the Lumos, the Metronet, the UScellular deal. Can you kind of just sum it up and say obviously it's revenue positive. What is it going to do to EBITDA in aggregate, maybe either through the year or on a run rate basis, and to free cash flow in terms of the investments that need to be made in these fiber projects so that we can kind of get a more holistic picture. Then Mike, if I could, obviously the subscriber growth guidance very strong, strongest ever at the beginning of the year. Obviously there's still a lot of questions about T-Mobile's exposure to the immigration question and what does your exposure to the prepaid market, the wholesale market, even your retail base.\nHow do we think about and get comfortable with.\nThat piece would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, we'll start to Peter, and fair warning, I'm going to go to Jon on the second one.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nPeter, yeah, absolutely, you're right. Again, the guide that we gave, other than for purposes of leverage and the associated cash interest, and of course being incorporated into the authorization from a capital returns perspective, everything else is incremental to the guide. I think it's a little premature for a number of reasons for me to give you what does the aggregate look like. One is, you know, when are we going to close each and every one of these. Two, some are private companies, some are public companies. I don't think it'd be appropriate for me ahead of close to give that color. I can tell you one thing, which is, for example, with UScellular, you know, one of the things, and we'll give color on this as and when we close.\nWe're looking at, we learned a lot from the very successful integration with Sprint, both from how to make it even better for customers, how to really quickly, as quickly as possible with the customer in mind first, you know, connect these two companies and generate the synergies. We're looking at all of that as we're getting closer to close and assessing, you know, how quickly can we do this, what does that mean from a cost to achieve perspective, etc. I think when and as these close is probably the better time to give you color on it for all of those reasons. They're all very accretive, certainly value accretive in the long run, which is why we did all of these, very exciting for us, and I'm just excited to get them closed and then give you some color.\nI will say a little bit more about the JVs and your question around investments and free cash flows. Remember, part of the reason that we did the JV structure is to, one, focus on who's best at what element of it. We're great at customer sales, servicing, and marketing, and that's what we're taking on. The JVs and the infrastructure co behind it are really great, some of the best in the US at laying fiber, and the ability to have that JV there also means we can lever it up appropriately and really leverage that capacity and go from a build perspective, so there isn't a CapEx burden on us. It really will be, you know, very efficient, very effective from a P&L perspective with respect to the JV's force.\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nThese are some of the reasons why we've, I think, provided the extra discipline of giving you our outlook before the consideration of all of these accretive opportunities that should drive the top line, should drive EBITDA, and after sort of modest and normative cost to achieve, should drive cash flows as well. Really positive story developing on the acquisition front. Okay, let's talk about prepaid and the dynamics that we see there. Maybe what's going on in the prepaid business and what do we expect as it relates to the immigration question? You bet. Hi Dave. Our prepaid business is doing incredibly well. When you look at the overall contribution of this prepaid business with industry-leading brands led by our flagship brand of Metro by T-Mobile, we're very, very pleased with the overall prepaid business.\nAs you can see in our overall 2024 results, over 250,000 prepaid net adds, the company's lowest churn ever for a full year in 2024. We're very, very pleased with the stability of that business. Business continues to incrementally grow relative to immigration. It's really early for us to really say in terms of what's happening around immigration, but I can tell you this, that when you look at the peak immigration flows into the country, whether legal, immigration, illegal, the overall peak in 2022, when you look at our prepaid business, we didn't really see an outsized impact in terms of inflow into our prepaid business. We believe that's the case because our business is primarily revolving around the very highest premium monthly prepaid subscriptions, and not necessarily the transactional prepaid business.\nWe have some of that, but most of that is concentrated within other companies throughout the entire prepaid category. Relative to our base, we feel that's very, very stable. We didn't see huge inflows in 2022 and 2023. Whatever might be playing out, we think we're very insulated from that perspective around our prepaid business and the overall broader business as a whole. We don't talk about prepaid often. That's a good point, about 22. You know, it doesn't seem to be that correlated to immigration because of the nature of our portfolio of brands. That's good news. I just want to say, like, we don't talk about this business much, and the team's done an extraordinary job. I mean, we're growing prepaid reliably, consistently. This quarter was by far the growth leader.\nWe just have the best portfolio of brands and the best executing team, and our customers love our product. You know, think about they're getting this incredible market-leading 5G network at an extraordinary value. As the leader, you would expect.\nYou know, you wouldn't necessarily expect a kind of consistent execution and ongoing growth that this team delivers. Thanks for asking about it. We don't talk about it very often.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAppreciate it, guys. Thank you so much.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Dave. We'll move on to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. AT&T has talked a lot about the attach rate of wireless in its.\nFiber footprint with.\nTheir latest disclosure showing a 40% attach rate for wireless.\nI wonder if you could just talk a bit about what kind of dynamics you see in converged footprints for your competitors, and whether the very high attach rates that at least AT&T is presenting and Verizon talks about, whether that influences your view of how much of a converged footprint you actually need as you think about Metronet and Lumos, another, or do you need something bigger?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSure, Craig. I mean, not much has changed on this since we outlined it for you last time, which is we believe that Americans are already operating in a converged world where they have the option to purchase wireline and wireless from the same provider more than 80% of the time, and they've had that option for more than five years. What we see is that in the places where our competitors have their wireline offers out there and experience attach, and they attach that you're describing, we also experience outperformance in those areas. We also experience better churn. There's some selection bias in it that goes beyond the causality that's suggested by the numbers. What we find is that customers, when you ask them in a survey, would you like to get your wireless and your wireline from the same company, they're like, well, sure.\nWhat we also find is that it doesn't seem to be a core motivator of purchase in either category. This is a considered sale, and customers will make the best broadband decision for them. Again, we're by far the broadband leader in this country and have been for 12 quarters in terms of growth, and they'll make the best wireless decision for themselves. If those come from the same company, great. You can see that in the numbers where, for example, Verizon says that they have lower churn where they also have fiber. We also have lower churn where Verizon has fiber. I'm not trying to discount the bundle effect. We see the bundle effect in our own business. When customers have a family plan of all mobile, they churn less. When they have, you know, multiple products from us, they churn less.\nThere are lots of ways to construct a bundle in our wireless business and our competitors' wireless business. The phone itself constructs a bundle where you have the rate plan of the service and a rate plan to pay that phone off over two years or more. That's a bundle. There are multiple ways. You can see this churn dynamic of the bundling take hold. As I said, Americans have had the choice for years of getting the same service from their wireline and their wireless, and most do not purchase them at the same time.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Craig. Operator, we'll move on to our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins, Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks, and good morning.\nMike.\nGiven some of your introductory comments, can you give us a teaser on some of the other strategic questions that you'd like to see T-Mobile answer over the next 12 months? Second, just back on the topic of SWA, can you share with us how much of the SWA success is coming from the business or SMB segment, and does this provide in the future that segment an incremental opportunity from what you're experiencing today? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah.\nWell, we'll start on the second one with Callie. It's a great question because we do see some really vital growth here, even though it's mostly so far a consumer dynamic. That may show that there's some tailwinds ahead.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident of Business Group, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, thanks, Mike. Mike, we've.\nLet me pause for a second and say I've had the opportunity to speak with hundreds of CIOs and CTOs in Enterprise and small business in the public sector. My team, who I'm so proud of for the results that we delivered this quarter, literally speak to thousands of them. What we're hearing from CIOs and CTOs is that they're really looking for more secure, more reliable connectivity, with more modern connectivity solutions that allow them to focus as partners in innovation on the value that fixed wireless brings. We see a lot of opportunities in multi-unit retail operations, in pharmacies, in insurance agencies where they have thousands of buildings across the country where we're serving as the primary connection. We also have lots of opportunities that are growing in our funnel for secondary and tertiary connections.\nWith our fixed wireless and with small businesses, we really see people adopting the value that they can get, then expanding our portfolio outside of just the fixed wireless solution with innovative solutions like Dialpad that allows them to replace some of the more outdated technology in their operations, which brings the opportunity to infuse AI in the way that they handle their customer calls or in the way that they communicate with their employees. It's really been, and it will continue to be, a great growth opportunity for us.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nTerrific. Were you asking me about my mike, about my comments that I want to spend more time on strategy and so on? You know, it's.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nYes.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. Okay, listen, I am so proud of the multi-year plan that we put out in the fall at our Capital Markets Day. One of the things underpinning it, if you kind of take our comments in, is that in this core business of ours, by some measures we're the most successful telecom in the world. Yet we have so many embedded capabilities around, incredible data and incredible network capabilities with room to run in terms of creating new services around them, a leading brand, incredible physical distribution, and rapidly growing incredible digital distribution, and so many other advantages that we can create new sources of value creation from. We began to tease some of those things at Capital Markets Day. We laid out a future relative to AI. We laid out a future relative to how 5G Advanced and 6G will unfold.\nWe hinted at new business models. You know, for us as we arrive at this size and this level of success in our core, we need to have the appropriate amount of focus on Horizon 3 opportunities. That is, you know, one of the areas where I'm focused and have been focused, which is why we were able to articulate this multi-year plan to you so that gives you a sense for it. You know, as I look at what we have and how we're executing, and the assets, capabilities, and the know-how that we have built, we are so well positioned to add value to this company, and it's going to take, you know, a lot of creativity, energy, and partnerships.\nYou know, I've been putting my focus there, and you saw some of that in our Capital Markets Day, I think.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you.\nAll right, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nAnalyst, New Street\n\nThanks, guys. Mike, I'm wondering if we could tap into two of those Horizon 3 opportunities in a little bit more detail. First, given.\nThe focus that you placed on AI at the Capital Markets day, I'd love to get a sense for the impact that you're seeing on network traffic from AI at the moment, how you think that evolves, and what that does for sort of future spectrum demand for you in the industry. I was impressed to hear about the availability of the Starlink directed device service in California. I didn't realize that had been rolled out across the entire market. I'm wondering if there's an opportunity to monetize that or if that sort of fits into the more value for the same price construct. Last quick one, should we be thinking about four hundreds again this year for fixed wireless access? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great. Is it only four or do you want us a couple more questions?\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nAnalyst, New Street\n\nI've got more. I've got more.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWhat you saw is that we quietly began, in addition to the emergency service that we provided during the wildfires, we've been quietly allowing people into our beta over the past few weeks, and it's just starting. We've been emphasizing a little more the northern part of the country, where the density of satellites is better. Meanwhile, there's rapid launches happening right now, so the satellite density is rapidly improving, and what you're going to see is a phasing. First, we're letting people in in limited numbers to the beta. Pretty soon, there's going to be a moment where we widen that aperture by quite a bit, and that'll be an exciting moment. Pretty soon after that, we begin commercial service. All this is going to start happening now in kind of rapid succession.\nWe're kind of finally at that moment we've been dreaming about on this service, and we see things coming together pretty quickly. That's really exciting as it relates to commercial service when we get it going. I mean, there's a couple of things here. One is we think this will be another reason, maybe the most compelling reason in a long time, to self-select up our rate card. This will be something that customers on our most value-packed plans will be able to benefit from. That's an area that we'll monetize, attracting and retaining customers, market share. That's an area where we'll monetize because this is a differentiated service that we think touches a chord with the American public. The idea of being connected everywhere, if you can see the sky, you're connected. This is powerful.\nIt's likely to save lives, it's likely to change lives, and it's very attractive. Share taking, and then finally a la carte sales for those that don't have the plans that include it, and lots of other customers. There may be opportunities there. Taken together, it's a pretty exciting moment for us. Fixed wireless.\nI can't give you a guide on it today other than to say that you've seen us over the past few quarters executing remarkably consistently. We're really happy with this performance.\nWe like it where it is. I don't think that's exactly a guide, it's a present statement. We like it where it is, and we can execute pretty consistently there, so it gives you a sense. Finally, and get ready, we're going to crank up ult here. You know, you asked for it.\nHow are we using AI in the network?\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, well, thanks for that question. It's great. Let me just start before we go into the absolute details there that the network is based on some fundamental things that are really delivering for us. One is our assets, our deepest frequency assets, subsidies in every one of those assets, the lowest part of the frequency, all of those together with this grid we have are delivering just amazing results in terms of third parties looking at.\nOur network and all that.\nHow we evolve that with AI is applying AI gradually into the RAN. For example, we went out on Capital Markets Day, talked about AI RAN, where we are able to evolve our network. This is about an evolution into 5G Advanced, into eventually even sixth generation. All of that in the rankings. When it comes to our customer centricity, the whole network team has industrialized a process over the last years that gives the opportunity for us to dedicate towers, build up upgrades, everything we do to exactly where customers need it. We're using AI to analyze thousands and millions of millions of data points across the network on a daily basis to understand exactly sentiments and movements in our customer base and correlate that with business outcomes, which is giving us the ability to allocate capital into those hex bins that Mike talked about earlier.\nLast but not least, it's our technology leadership, and that technology leadership, we are applying AI together with our partners and vendors on the roadmaps that they provide to us. I would pride our team, and I'm extremely proud of our team, that is able to take the latest and greatest of features and softwares that come out of our partners and put that to work in our network. A lot of that is already AI based. Last but not least, I think what is really good with the network team now is that we are able to platformize the network using AI capabilities for an autonomous network model. We already got there. Others are talking about it, but we've already done it. By that, we can support Freier's consumer business, Callie's enterprise business, Mike's new business development.\nGreat question, and lots of work more to come.\nAcceleration in traffic, Romeo.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US",
    "content2": "Yeah, I want to make sure I get to that, Jonathan. Just before I do, I want to give Ulf that opportunity to talk about what we're doing and how advanced it is because it's really differentiated, and you see it all over the place in terms of how we apply capital dollars with our AI model we talked about at Capital Markets Day called customer driven coverage. It's a breakthrough in terms of how capital gets allocated with the business outcomes in mind, or in my prepared remarks I talked about.\nSelf optimizing technologies. This is remarkable stuff where the network can self heal now using AI techniques. If we see an area for whatever reason go down due to a wildfire, the network can tilt other sectors to beam in from further away and borrow from that sector's capacity to make sure that nobody goes unconnected. It's very powerful, and you know, it's stuff that we don't get to talk about much, some of which are real differentiators that are resulting in additional reasons why we keep winning all these awards. As it relates to AI, I would put it a different way, which is AI demands on our network are going to be one of the reasons that we are able to ongoing showcase the additional differentiation that we have.\nIn other words, I don't see this being a reason why we're going to need more capacity or more spectrum. It's going to be a reason to showcase the massively superior capacity that we already have. You can see that in the speeds. You know, we won Ookla by a lot nationwide. I mean, 46 out of 50 states we are the fastest provider, and what that translates to, I mean, speeds look like a proxy for capacity, right? What that translates to is that we have way more available capacity per customer than anyone else. AI growth and AI workloads are going to be a way for us to increasingly showcase that differentiation, especially as AI begins to make the leap from textual interfaces to much more video, audio, imagery that we're now seeing the popularity take off on.\nIt's early days, but I think this is a nice tailwind for our business because it's going to be important that we're able to showcase these advantages to customers in ways other than you go to a speed test and see a needle that's higher, do you know what I mean? Because video only plays so fast. If you're able to get these responses in a more immersive way, that's powerful, and I think people are going to appreciate T-Mobile for it.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question from the phone, and then we'll go over to social.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\nStarting with the reported EBITDA, obviously the numbers were pretty strong, just wanted to understand if this was impacted in any storms, insurance, or any other elements.\nDuring, maybe it may have been a headwind or a tailwind. Then more broadly.\nAs we think about this partnership opportunity with SpaceX, given that they're also launching bigger satellites with more capacity and so on, potentially is there an opportunity here to expand beyond just the direct to device market, especially in rural areas? You have your fixed wireless offering, but is there a bundling opportunity? Potentially.\nA more efficient way to use your spectrum.\nBy bundling other services. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. Kannan, just to let you know, your microphone's kind of breaking up, so we were only able to get some of that. As it relates to SpaceX, look, we're really happy to be partnered with them. They're the world's most advanced space organization. They had more launches last year than the rest of the world combined. They're a very important partner for us. We're in a multi-year partnership that we think will confer real differentiated benefits for our customers as it relates to partnering on home broadband. Not right away, you know, I don't want to speak for them, but they have more demand for their service than capacity right now, and they can sell everything they have available without any help from us.\nThat being said, they are launching a lot, and those curbs may cross at some point, and we'd be delighted to be their partner. As it relates to the core EBITDA questions, storms, insurance, etc., I'll turn to Peter.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, yeah. I mean Q4, obviously we're very, very excited about the Q4 core EBITDA result. Your question, of course every quarter has some puts and takes. I think we had foreshadowed there was a spectrum gain there, and of course we were going to have impacts, headwinds from ACP, which wound up being a little bit above that midpoint of the range that we gave, and of course storms as well. Well, despite all that, like every single quarter, this team goes and executes, and not only did we deliver a very fabulous Q4 core EBITDA, but we did it while funding even more customer growth.\nI don't see right now in terms of the guide that I gave you a lot of one-time, you know, tailwinds or headwinds. It really is for 2025 about being able to take that top line service revenue growth and fund our highest ever got, and also make the right investments again, not only to deliver 2025, but to set us up for those Capital Markets Day commitments that we gave you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, Janice, I know we're tight on time, but what are we seeing coming in from.\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, I'm going to consolidate two questions that are particularly relevant for Callie's area. One is from Bill Ho about how 5G SA as the first mover translated into any wins. Is network slicing the biggest service revenue opportunity so far? We can't not take the Chetan question that has to do with I want to see how the demand for T-Priority is shaping up for 2025 scenarios where enterprises are interested in using the network slicing, so it all ties together.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI see what you did there. It's over to Callie.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident of Business Group, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Dennis, Chetan, and Bill. Love to talk about T-Priority. I want to say first and foremost we don't fall in love with our technology for the sake of technology. We listen to our customers, we listen to first responders, we listen to CIOs who say, look, we really have a need for better coverage, for more capacity, and we need more modern solutions to address the way that firefighters and police officers are needing to perform their responsibilities and life-saving, literal lifeline to our society with technology. That's where T-Priority came from. With T-Priority, we are able to present to first responders 40% more capacity in our network, 2.5x the speed, and in a time of extreme congestion, we're able to allocate more than 5x the network resources that we do to the average consumer.\nWe're seeing this play out in North Carolina and Nashville, in Florida, in Los Angeles. You heard Mike saying in his opening remarks that we have been awarded the single carrier contract with the City of New York. This is the City of New York. They take 9 million, over 9 million 911 calls. They have a million buildings in the city. They don't joke around when it comes to the safety of their communities and the strength of the network. That's why we are awarded this deal, because of the power of our network, our 5G superiority. We're really excited about the partnership and the opportunity to innovate with the public safety network, as well as connecting school kids in meaningful ways and really understanding what a true partnership looks like for the City of New York. That's not all.\nWhen we look at the first responder community, we told you at Capital Markets Day that one of our strategies was to look at areas of our business where we are underpenetrated, and provide solutions in those areas where underpenetrated, and first responders happen to be one of those areas. There's today 14 million lines that are available in that community. By 2028, we expect that to be around 18 million. This is an opportunity where the strength of our network, the way that our team partners with customers, and really listens to what first responders need in a time of crisis to be able to better support and save lives, really think this is a great opportunity for us. That's where we're predominantly using, Bill, to your question, slicing. Today we have a lot of exciting opportunities.\nWe've talked about T-SIMsecure and using our network slicing as a way to make connectivity more secure for all types of applications in our network. We're starting to see our funnels and our demands filled there. Thanks for the question.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. You know, Bill and Chet and I would just add that we waited a long time before starting to talk about all this stuff because we wanted to see a real business model develop around it. Some people were out there talking about it years ago and built it into business plans. We were very deliberate that we said, no, we're going to wait. The moment's kind of arriving, you know, and T-Priority is certainly an expression of it. Other 5G slicing use cases, advanced network capabilities that Ulf and team have brought, where we're leaders, where we're differentiated, are creating the biggest pipeline of interest for TFB that we have ever seen. I mean, our funnel is better right now than it has ever been, and we're demonstrating these capabilities at scale.\nI mean, Callie had like 70 CIOs at the F1 racing event where we had a dedicated network slice powering all the commercial operations of the race, where there are a million people nearby, yet the commercial operations are operating on their own 5G slice. Everybody saw that, and people's eyes are opening. What's interesting here is that it's not just a direct revenue opportunity, it's also a share-taking opportunity. The dynamic we've seen, and we described it in New York, is that people come in for the differentiated capability of the 5G Advanced services that only T-Mobile could provide, but then they pivot all their smartphones or many of their smartphones over. There are two ways for us to grow based on all this.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident of Business Group, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIs that it, Cathy?\n\nCathy Yao\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThat is it. That's all the time we have. Thank you for joining us today.\nWe look forward to speaking to you again soon.\nIf you have any further questions, you may contact the investor relations or media department.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks for your interest and your questions, everybody. See you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our earnings as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. We're coming to you from New York today. And if you're watching online, you can see I'm with several members of the senior team, ready to discuss these strong quarterly results, and our recent news and, of course, to take your questions.\nThis T-Mobile team just continues to demonstrate strong execution across the board. And we're taking up our customer growth and cash flow guidance for the full year once again. I'm going to begin with a comment on customer growth because this quarter not only represented our highest-ever Q2 postpaid phone net adds in company history, but we also pushed past a major milestone, 100 million customer connections.\nThis growth was once again balanced geographically, across both smaller markets and rural areas and top 100 markets. We also grew our postpaid phone gross adds at the highest rate in nearly 3 years. And at the same time, we delivered yet another record low upgrade rate this quarter, speaking to the strength of our customers' experience on our differentiated 5G network.\nAnd speaking of experience, let me now turn to that network leadership. We swept every category for overall network performance in the latest OpenSignal and Ookla test. According to OpenSignal, T-Mobile's download speeds are up to 3x as fast as peers, alongside having nearly 6x the 5G availability as our next closest competitor.\nAnd our network was also awarded the most consistent by both independent third parties, a key indicator of an overall superior network experience. We continue to invest thoughtfully and in a highly capital-efficient model to extend our network leadership, and it shows. It is really a privilege to see our team's hard work show up and recognition like this and to share it with you.\nOkay. Turning to broadband. Our fixed wireless offering continues to resonate with customers, leading us to capture a record share of industry broadband net adds this quarter. And now we have an incredible 5.6 million fixed wireless broadband customers.\nI hope you all saw our news from last week as I'm excited to talk to you about our partnership with KKR and to acquire Metronet. The Metronet team is the nation's fastest-growing pure-play fiber provider. This is a unique company and asset. They already reach over 2 million homes today. And with this partnership are expected to grow to 6.5 million homes passed by 2030, bringing consumers greater choice where they need it most.\nAnd we are equally excited to work alongside KKR's expert infrastructure team on this project. And as with our Lumos JV, T-Mobile will leverage our scale, brand, distribution and existing customer relationships to grow faster and to do it smarter. I can't highlight enough how both the Metronet and Lumos JVs represent best-in-class partnerships in the fiber space.\nBecause of the partners that we've chosen and T-Mobile's unique assets and capabilities, I believe this is going to be a very successful initiative for our shareholders. Now going back to the current business and our financials. In Q2, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth in customers and translating that to industry-leading service revenue growth and industry-leading core adjusted EBITDA growth. That, combined with our capital efficiency has led to a record adjusted free cash flow quarter that grew 54% year-over-year and once again led the major wireless companies in free cash flow margin. I could not be more proud of this team's results this quarter.\nOkay. To sum it all up, we are staying true to our Un-carrier DNA while focusing on smart and profitable growth, delivering record financial results. Our durable and differentiated model continues to outperform. And I look forward to sharing more about the Un-carriers next chapter on value creation at our Capital Markets Day, which will be in the second half of September. And we're going to get that on your calendars very soon. So Peter, let's hand it to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you very much, Mike. As you can see, we delivered yet another strong quarter. Mike already highlighted the momentum in our wireless and broadband business as well as our impressive financial results. But before turning to our outlook, I wanted to briefly touch on our acquisition of Mint Mobile and Ultra on May 1.\nWe couldn't be more excited for them to join Team Magenta. From a financial perspective, the acquisition resulted in a onetime prepaid base adjustment of approximately 3.5 million customers. Subsequent to the close, the incorporation of Mint and Ultra also resulted in approximately $100 million in net additional service revenue relative to Q1, which is net of the reduction in wholesale revenues. And also resulted in a small benefit to core EBITDA as the revenue was largely offset with SG&A expenses as we made additional investments into the business to drive customer growth.\nAll right. Let me shift to an update on our expectations for the remainder of 2024. Starting with customers, we are excited to raise our total postpaid customer net additions to now be between 5.4 million and 5.7 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the total postpaid phone net customer additions component to be approximately half of our total postpaid additions, up from our expectations last quarter.\nAnd as part of that, we anticipate normal seasonal postpaid phone churn trends in the second half as we saw a year ago. We continue to expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up to 3% higher year-over-year and our industry-leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023.\nWe now expect our core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.5 billion and $31.8 billion for the full year, unchanged at the midpoint, which is up 9% year-over-year. This includes our latest estimate on the impact of ACP as well as funding our higher postpaid customer guide.\nOn ACP, we now expect the year-over-year impact to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million, driven primarily by what we're seeing at some of our wholesale providers.\nOkay. Turning to cash CapEx. We now expect to be between $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion as we continue to invest and lead in network performance with unmatched capital efficiency. While our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we discussed before, 2024 is a bit lower given certain capital-efficient network activities, such as spectrum refarming and deploying additional 2.5 gigahertz licenses from auction 108, benefiting from the significant 5G radio deployments during our merger integration.\nWe would expect Q3 to be the low watermark for the year before were accelerating in Q4 with more site upgrades and build activity. Lastly, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $16.6 billion to $17 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and up 24% year-over-year, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency and translating to an industry-leading service revenue to adjusted free cash flow margin.\nIn closing, we delivered another strong quarter and expect another year of durable and differentiated growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry.\nWe are looking forward to sharing more on our multiyear plans to continue to unlock shareholder value at Capital Markets Day this fall. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Cathy to begin the Q&A. Cathy?",

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nWelcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call we'll make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings which I encourage you to review.

And with that, let me turn it over to Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, thanks Jud. Good afternoon everybody. Welcome. If you're watching online, you can see that I've got a good part of the senior team here. We're coming to you from Bellevue, Washington today, and we're looking forward to a great discussion. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a great start in 2024. The year is unfolding right in line with what we expected across the board, and in fact better in some areas, and we're increasing our guidance for the year accordingly. I'll briefly touch on a few highlights, and then we'll get right to your questions. First, a comment on growth. We continued to take share in Q1 just as expected with postpaid phone net adds that were right in line with Q1 last year while industry net adds were lower by a double digit percentage.\nOur best value, best network proposition continues to resonate in the market with our postpaid phone gross adds up year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, even while industry gross adds were down, and we matched our best ever Q1 postpaid phone churn, showing that customers love the Un-carrier value proposition and network. Second, a comment on those lowest ever postpaid upgrades for phones in Q1. I think this metric showcases our ongoing winning formula by demonstrating that customers choose to stay with T-Mobile for the best-in-class value and network they enjoy, which is the only retention strategy that drives profitable growth over the long term. The network is an increasingly powerful part of our customers' loyalty as 3/4 of our postpaid phone customers already have a 5G smartphone and they're having a differentiated experience on the T-Mobile network.\nIt also demonstrates how we put our investments where they can have the greatest customer impact, letting natural customer demand drive the pace of upgrades overall. From consumers in major metros to smaller markets, and businesses from large enterprises to SMBs, T-Mobile's durable differentiated growth momentum continues across the segments, and the most exciting part is that there are still many years of market-leading growth runway ahead for our core business. Okay, let's talk broadband. Home broadband customers love a great value on a great network too. That's been the formula that's made us the fastest growing broadband provider for the past two years. We did it again in Q1 as our 405,000 nets are expected to represent a higher share of industry broadband net adds than even a year ago, and are expected to be more than half of all nets from the major providers.\nOnce again, our broadband strategy is unfolding exactly the way we said it would, and we now proudly serve over 5 million high-speed internet customers. As we previously announced, we're also growing the value of that customer base, successfully sunsetting our launch era promotions and attracting customers at our nominal price points. In addition, our new rate plans for home mesh networks and for on-the-go usage are just the latest ways we intend to continue to enhance the value of this space and find new ways to serve customers better. Okay, let me comment on fiber. I've been saying for a while that smart fiber partnerships would allow us to profitably serve even more broadband customers, and today we announced a joint venture with EQT that will acquire Lumos.\nConsistent with everything we've said for the last year, this JV is the latest example of a capital-light model, and we're excited to have such great and experienced partners. EQT is one of the leading infrastructure investors across the US and Europe and brings a wealth of knowledge to the table. The Lumos management team under Brian Stading is outstanding and has years of experience building fiber in an efficient, cost-effective, and targeted build model. We're really excited to be able to accelerate what Lumos has already been doing to reach more and more households in the years ahead. Together we target 3.5 million homes passed by 2028, and T-Mobile expects to invest about $950 million upon close, which we expect less than a year from now, and another $500 million between 2027 and 2028 to get there.\nT-Mobile will be a 50% owner of Lumos and will own the customer relationships, including their existing fiber customers at close, as Lumos will convert to a wholesale model. This is exactly the type of value creating investment that we had contemplated with our strategic envelope of funds that we set aside back when we shared the current stockholder return program with you last fall, and we expect to remain on track as it relates to our stockholder return ambitions. Lastly, I am so happy to report that we have received regulatory approval to acquire Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile, and we therefore currently expect to close on 1 May. We are really looking forward to welcoming them to the Un-carrier family, and I know they're going to fit in because they are hyper focused on offering customers compelling products at a great value.\nWe'll work to further fuel their success while also learning from their team who are absolute rock stars in the direct-to-consumer and value segments. Financially, in Q1, we again showed how T-Mobile translates profitable growth into market-leading consolidated service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth that was double the rate of our principal competitors, and T-Mobile again delivered the highest free cash flow margins in the industry. So, to wrap up, our model is working, it's consistent, and our confidence in it only builds with each passing quarter of success. We remain focused on continuing to take share in wireless and broadband while delivering industry-leading growth in service revenue, profitability, and cash flows.\nI couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for T-Mobile, and I want you to know that we plan to have a Capital Markets Day this fall where we look forward to going deeper with you on topics like the big opportunities that we see coming, how we're seizing them, and how that will translate into enormous value creation for our company in the years ahead. I think you're going to see once again that in many ways we're just getting started. Okay Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, thank you Mike. All right, as you can see we kicked off 2024 with great momentum. Mike already highlighted our best in class growth in both the top and bottom line and how our industry leading conversion of service revenue to adjusted free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into our updated expectations for how that growth will continue in 2024 starting with customers where we now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.2 and 5.6 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint.\nWe now expect full-year postpaid ARPA to grow up to 3% in 2024, a further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023 from both the continued execution of our strategy to win and expand account relationships and as we anticipate taking further rate plan optimization actions within the base. There is no change in our expectations for postpaid phone net adds from our original guidance last quarter, with Q1 strong growth coming in as we expected and because we anticipate slight year-over-year headwinds to postpaid phone net adds in Q2 and Q3 related to those rate plan optimizations, which are accretive to the business on an all-in basis. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $31.4 and 31.9 billion, up 9%year-over-year at the midpoint. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect our industry-leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023, even with the discontinuation of the Affordable Connectivity Program that appears imminent at this point in time and is contemplated within the increased guidance.\nWe continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 and 9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. Lastly, we now expect adjusted free cash flow including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $16.4 to 16.8 billion. This is up 23% over last year at the midpoint and five times the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor thanks to our margin expansion, capital efficiency, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents an adjusted free cash flow to service revenue margin which is multiple percentage points higher than peers. So in closing, we continue to expect 2024 to be another year of differentiated profitable growth. As we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities.\nWe expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry. Unlocking shareholder value, I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. Okay, before we open it up for Q&A, I just want to take a moment to announce a changing of the guard in our investor relations leadership. After 11 years and an unbelievable 44 earnings cycles in IR, I'm tremendously excited for Jud to take on a broader role within our finance organization. I'm equally excited to introduce Cathy Yao as our new SVP of Investor Relations.\nMany of you may know Cathy from her time on the sell-side at MoffettNathanson or on the corporate side at Altice USA, among other roles on her fabulous resume. We look forward to Cathy continuing T-Mobile's strong tradition of investor relations excellence. With that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin his last Q&A.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Peter. All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone by pressing star, then one, and via X by sending a post to @tmobileIR or @mikesievert using $TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe first question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nStock Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks, and good afternoon, and congrats, Jud, on the new role. Just a couple questions if I could. So first, you mentioned that you may be taking some pricing actions and that could affect some of the subscriber performance in 2Q, 3Q. Can you unpack the plan of how you're approaching those actions and how to think about the net benefit, and then just secondly, taking a step back, if you can, give us an update on how you're seeing the competitive landscape, how you're seeing the switcher pool, and how T-Mobile is navigating some of these changes with the industry seemingly having lower upgrades, lower churn. Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great. Well, why don't I jump in and I'll give a comment on, or a lack of a comment on the first question and then I'll hand it to Jon Freier for the second one. No, we're not really going to announce any particular plans today. I will tell you that nothing we do is going to question or challenge our long standing strategy of being the value leader in this market. But surely over the span of many years, what that means kind of changes over time, costs have risen, changes have happened in a broader industry context, and, you know, we're going to jealously guard that value, value leadership.\nI think customers understand that if there are changes around the margins once every many years in a world where costs change, you know, they'll understand and accept that we've actually made changes here and there over the past, you know, six months. We've understood what that looks like and what that takes. There may be more changes, particularly with older rate plans. But we're not here to announce anything. I will tell you that all the outcomes that we see from all of that on the customer side as well as on the ARPA side, and on the EBITDA and revenue side are contained within the guidance that Peter just shared. You want to add anything to that first question before we go to the second one?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nI think you got it.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, competitive context, what are we seeing on upgrades? What's driving that? What's happening with the competition, Jon?\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, you bet. So I'll tell you a little bit about what's happening competitively. It's been an intense competitive environment in the marketplace, but it's been generally consistent as you look at this overall competition intensity. And you know, for our business, you know, we continue to have these differentiated growth opportunities, whether that be smaller markets in rural areas, whether that be within our high-speed internet or in our overall enterprise and government space that Callie can talk about in just a few moments as well. And so, you know, during that overall competitive context, we have these unique growth vectors that we continue to be under penetrated on driving a lot of good success so far, but continue to have a lot of runway in front of us.\nSo while that competitive environment is intense, you know, sometimes one competitor is leaning in, sometimes one competitor is leaning out, we're always navigating that. You know, things are always changing. Sometimes it's a little bit more device oriented, sometimes it might be more rate oriented in terms of how the competitive environment is unfolding. But we've navigated that for years and years now and continue to be very comfortable with how that overall competitive environment is playing out. With respect to upgrades, we continue to meet the natural demand of upgrades. As you can see, the upgrade rate is a low 2.4%. At the same time, when we're matching the best Q1 postpaid phone churn performance in the company's history, we've been more targeted and surgical with some of our upgrade offers for sure, but the overall natural demand and the upgrade cycle is lengthening.\nIt's really kind of the best of both worlds when you have customers that are staying at incredible rates, record low rates, and not staying for free devices exclusively. They're staying for this differentiated value proposition, the network, and the overall experience. Something we're very, very pleased with, how it's unfolding.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI'll just add one last thing. As I said in my prepared remarks, 75% of our customers have 5G devices. And those customers are having a very differentiated experience with T-Mobile's lead in 5G. And we can talk more about that, I hope, during the call. I'm so pleased with what's happened. We continue to extend our lead. And so the impetus when you're having a fantastic experience on your phone to prematurely swap it out just isn't there. And they'll do it in a stepwise way. They continue to do it. And you can tell we're upgrading people fast enough by the fact that all those people have 5G phones, which is right at or even above competitive benchmarks. So our customers continue to upgrade at just the pace that we think is appropriate.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, great, operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Maybe first on the Lumos transaction. First, should we expect similar deals in other parts of the country? And you talked about 3.5 million homes passed. Is that about, I mean, that's just in one small part of the country. Should we expect something similar as you, as we look at the rest of the US? And then in the release today, you guys had a line about not being able to meet all the demand for broadband with your fixed wireless network. Can you talk a little bit about how much growth there is left there and if you're seeing capacity constraints in any particular areas? Thanks.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nWhat kind of partner ecosystem are you building to execute on your strategy?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nLove it. Let's go straight to Callie.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident and Strategic Advisor, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, well thanks, Hodulik, for the question. We saw very strong growth in Q1, outpacing our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone nets. You know, to comment a little bit on the question that Jon was answering in the business category, if we're seeing pressure in that category, I think it might be us. You know, one of the interesting things I think that's going on in our business right now is that not only are we delivering on top line growth, but also on CLV growth across all segments. You know, in enterprise, we just delivered our strongest postpaid nets ever in the history of the company. We also delivered our lowest churn in enterprise, in SMB. We had our highest ever port ratios, and we're net positive for seven consecutive quarters. So we're really liking the pace of the business.\nWe've really graduated from just being a price comp to really a solution-oriented sale for customers. We see that with partnerships with Dialpad Ai, with delivering mission-critical push-to-talk. I know, John, you also asked who are some of the partners that we're working with in building our ecosystem. You know, obviously we're partnering with the largest OEMs, working with Ericsson and Cisco, as well as industry segment experts like Oceus when it comes to serving our government customers. So really building out our ecosystem that allows us to really focus on enterprise solutions, enabling them to innovate and to serve their customers from scratch. I will mention just a couple of key wins in the Advanced Network Solutions business.\nYou might have read about our partnership agreement with Delta, where they named us as their preferred wireless provider, but we're also deploying a 5G hybrid network solution at their Atlanta headquarters, which we're really excited about. Also, the US Coast Guard is working with us to build out a private network to deliver seamless, secure connectivity from ship to shore. And then with Ericsson, not only as a strategic partner, but we're also working with them to deploy our first.\nNetwork slice on a SIM-based SASE solution within a 5G-connected laptop. So we're really excited about the kinds of solutions, the sort of enterprises that we're bringing on, and the momentum in the business overall.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIt's really interesting when you hear us talk about enterprise, how different it is from four or five years ago. I mean, we were trying our best to sell SIMs to companies that would take meetings with us, like the procurement department. And what's happened in this 5G strategy as it's unfolded is Callie and team have built solutions to some of the most pressing connectivity problems that enterprises of all kinds face. And suddenly we're in strategic conversations because we have capabilities like Network Slicing, like SIM-based security, and many other emerging 5G capabilities that are way out in front. And that's not just getting us revenues in those advanced 5G services, but it's also winning us all those smartphones that we used to struggle so hard, and back then have to price so hard to win. So it's been this really nice evolution.\nMake no mistake, we love low prices and we're going to be the value leader here. But today we're solving some of the most common, complicated connectivity problems that enterprises and organizations face. And that is a great place to compete.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident and Strategic Advisor, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. Thank you, Mike. Totally agree.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. All right, let's try this again. Operator, can we get a question?\n\nOperator\n\nSure. The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, guys. Hey, how are you guys? So I have a couple questions on the Lumos transaction. So first of all, should we just think of this transaction as sort of a one-off or should we expect other deals similar to this in other regions? And then of the 3.5 million homes you guys are talking about passing, how big could that get over the next five years? So that's first. And then second of all, in the release, you guys talked about not being able to fulfill the demand that you're seeing in broadband. On the fixed wireless side, you know, how much growth is still left in fixed wireless and are you seeing areas today where you're running out of capacity? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, let's start with the second one. All along, if I'll remind all of our listeners, I know you know this. Our fixed wireless strategy has always been about selling excess capacity where we predict normal cell phone usage won't suck up that 5G capacity. And so, you know, this gives us the opportunity to serve broadband customers. And now at scale, we're serving millions and millions of them under this strategy. We had originally said we saw this strategy leading to about seven to eight million total customers. In terms of opportunity, we don't have any updates on that. I've said several times we're working on thinking about examining ways that we could try to extend that, and we haven't drawn any conclusions yet.\nWe have to make sure it's done in an economic way, and we have to make sure it's done in a way that customers will love and they have a fantastic product experience. That being said, what's interesting about fiber can be a strategy that relieves some pressure on the 5G network and extend the TAM. And if you think about it right, because some customers will, where we offer fiber in the future will be able to naturally graduate up to fiber, which is really a totally separate category. And that obviously opens up an opportunity for their neighbor to then become a 5G customer. So there's some TAM expansion there. And then to your point, even in places where Lumos currently operates, you know, we have a long wait list of people who applied. They put their address in our system.\nThey applied to be a fixed wireless customer, and we haven't accepted them yet because their address isn't one of those places that I described where we have the predicted excess capacity. So there's lots of opportunity there. As it relates to your first question around, you know, is this the first of many, et cetera. Look, we don't have anything to say about that other than you know, our strategy is to opportunistically find ways that are very capital light, very smart to put our brand in this space. We've done that here, and we think this will lead to millions of homes passed. You know, that's a great place for us to be. We're going to continue to learn, grow, expand, and you know, we're open minded about this, but we're not interested in any wholesale changes that basically change who we are.\nYou know, no big on-balance-sheet acquisitions are currently being examined. You know, it's not something that we know our investors like: our fast, efficient, capital-efficient, high-capital-return strategy, and we have no intentions of changing all that. That being said, if we can lay track for the long term in a very capital-efficient way, we're open-minded, and we really like this model that we've struck with EQT and Lumos. You know, can't wait to get started and, you know, get this approved through the regulatory bodies and begin to see this build-out accelerate.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, great, operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nAll right, thank you. And first, Jud, thank you and congratulations. But thank you for all those 40 some odd quarters of your able support and help. And congratulations to Cathy, if she's on the call. A question about ACP. Just because that's the obligatory topic this quarter, can you just talk about what you expect with ACP, how you think that might affect your business, especially perhaps your prepaid business, but whether you think it'll have an impact on your postpaid business as well. And you just introduced a plan where you no longer do credit checks, which I think was a head scratcher to me, just coming right before the expiry of ACP. I wonder if you could just talk about how you plan to sort of ensure that ACP customers without government support won't upend that kind of an offer.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, let's start out with Mike Katz so we can disentangle some of these offers for you because there could be some misunderstanding out there. Then we'll go to Peter and talk about the financial. What we see in the financial picture as it relates to the expected turndown of ACP.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Strategy, and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, thanks, Craig. You know, first, to answer the first part of your question on what our expectations are with ACP at this point, we're expecting that the program funding is going to end, and the impact of that is fully contemplated in the guidance that Peter talked about and shared earlier. And as a reminder, I think it's important to contextualize like how T-Mobile has participated in the ACP program. First of all, we have not participated in it in any form in postpaid across any products. It's nonexistent in our postpaid business. We have a small amount; I think we've said a couple hundred thousand inside of our prepaid, our owned prepaid portfolio, and the vast amount of our participation is inside wholesale via wholesale partners that we work with.\nSo just to contextualize where our participation is. That being said, we are both in the small amount that we have in our own prepaid business, but also with our wholesale partners working with them on communication and plans to help those customers transition. We think wireless is not a category that customers are going to walk away from. So these customers need another alternative, and we're working closely with the partners and with the customers to find them another alternative, whether it's other plans or other programs like Lifeline. So we're deep in doing that. And look, we think if you look at T-Mobile and Mike talked a lot about our passion around and focus around guarding our value position and the brands in our portfolio like Metro and soon to be Mint, these are all value brands that are focused on delivering value.\nWe think that's a great opportunity both to help customers, you know, inside of our wholesale partners to transition, but honestly customers that also may feel stranded from competitors to come to find a value to continue their wireless services. So I hope that's helpful for the question you're answering.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, and let me maybe add to that just a little bit on your other questions. Craig and I think Mike really highlighted our thinking around this. Well, of course it's in front of us more so than behind us. No new activations as of February, but it's in front of us. But we think it's fully baked into the guidance range that we gave you, the range of outcomes that we anticipate. And when we think about you asked about the no credit check and I can tell you one we continue to see very healthy levels of bad debt. We continue to actually be the leader compared to our peers in terms of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue. So we're very happy with what we see there. We're always testing and trying new things.\nFor example, we have a way and an ability for prepaid customers who have a certain number of on-time payments to graduate into postpaid without an incremental credit check. And that's because we have data and know exactly how those customers behave over time and what the really data-informed credit risk around those consumers are. So we're always going to be testing around the edges what is really beneficial for consumers while being very thoughtful around, of course, risk protection for the entity. And that's why we sit at the bad debt rates that we do.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Strategy, and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nThat's not new. We've had that program in place for many years.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nIs there any risk though that ACP customers who've been essentially getting their bills paid by the government and therefore have good credit histories might be higher credit risk as ACP ends?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. You're absolutely right. And that's thoughtful around it. Remember, as Mike Katz said, the amount of ACP customers that are sitting in our prepaid base in Metro is very small. So that's a very small expense.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Strategy, and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nThe amount in the postpaid base is zero.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nZero. Postpaid is absolutely zero for us. So it's really finding, and you saw us probably launch out there, some ways to help consumers and think about can you get into other programs like T-Mobile Connect or other low-cost opportunities or Lifeline type of construct. Look, we're going to be very thoughtful around making sure customers in this critical category stay connected while being, of course, very thoughtful around the risk profile to T-Mobile.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Strategy, and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYou know, as Mike pointed out, it's not just our customers that are facing this right. Everybody else is. But we've got this incredible portfolio of brands that are famous for value, and we're going to make sure that those brands are in front of people because we're going to stand up and serve them in a time when they might find that they need a new offer. And we will be there with incredible offers for them.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, you bet.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOperator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks guys. Congratulations to Jud and Cathy. That's fantastic news. Since it's Jud's last call, I've got nine questions to ask.\nI'll try and consolidate them. So Mike, I'm wondering if you can give us just an update on the sort of the fiber strategies that you're collecting together in aggregate. So you've announced so far pilot the Lumos deal. I think there are deals out there with Tillman, Intrepid, and SiFi. How many, when you put all of those together, how many homes passed does it amount to? And for the Lumos deal specifically, how much cash is EQT putting in? We're just trying to get a sense of sort of the total capitalization here and then how much comes from sort of incremental, incremental debt. And then my last question on this is how do you fit. All of the deals that we've heard about so far seem to be focused on guys building new infrastructure.\nHow do you think about those sorts of assets versus partnering with guys who have existing copper infrastructure that they're upgrading? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet. We won't be able to give you too much on sort of broad strategy here other than the fact that we're opportunistic. The strategies we've employed so far, both across wholesale, which we got started on in a very small way already, as well as this new partnership, are about putting the T-Mobile brand and team to work selling a fiber product that complements our wildly successful 5G product. And to us that's a great strategy because we believe we have an opportunity to generate superior returns than a purely disinterested investor could do by virtue of our assets and our know-how, and we've proven that know-how to ourselves through our success with 5G home internet. You think about our incredible distribution, our leading brand, our 10s of millions of customers, our incredible team.\nWe have, we have very insightful data that our customers give us permission to use to put relevant offers about their T-Mobile experience in front of them. These are all advantages that a purely financial or disinterested investor wouldn't have. And so when we look at this area and say can we extract a return that's better than others, could we have some confidence? And so we think about it from that opportunistic standpoint, not from a convergence, defensive standpoint. You know, we believe that our T-Mobile offers stand tall and standalone and don't \"need convergence\". We just think that this is a place where we can make customers happy and generate a superior financial return and that it complements a leadership product that we already have out there. Beyond that, I can't say much more about the strategy other than what I said earlier.\nYou know, we like this partnership. We're very excited about where it could go. Maybe Peter can comment on the capital structure, but one of the things I do like about it is that we decided as we formed this to fund it and give it the wherewithal with some additional debt to have everything it needs from an equity standpoint to get to the 3.5 million homes passed, which we think is, you know, a nice threshold for us. It'll be a multi-state footprint. It'll be big enough to matter, and of course that will be through a combination of debt and equity.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. And again, Jonathan can't give you all the details because we have counterparties involved in this. First, it is a 50/50 joint venture. It will be unconsolidated for us. So it's an equity method investment for us. So everybody kind of captures that fine point. And then, as Mike said there, it's just given that it's a 50/50, there will be obviously cash infusion from EQT as the partner in this as well. And when you think about that incremental $500 million, for example, that would be an equivalent cash infusion from EQT. And there is, given this is an infrastructure and a great anchor tenant in the form of T-Mobile, having the retail customers, there is an ability to also leverage the entity up. And the overarching thought process is about, you know, a maximum of 2:1 debt to equity ratio.\nBut it'll be based on what the funding needs of the entity actually is to get to that 3.5 million.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nOne quick follow up, Peter, if I can. You mentioned at the beginning that you sort of set capital aside for things like this in 2024. You haven't used up that whole sort of reservoir of capital yet. If you look at what's left there, is it more directed towards fiber transactions like this or spectrum? Like how do you sort of balance between those two assets?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nIt really is looking at what the best return profile for T-Mobile is. Sometimes as you know, spectrum opportunities may come up; they may not come up. We could have some of the 2.5 GHz leased spectrum come up, and we have rights of first refusal around those. So it's still a balance. We don't have line of sight to how we would use every dollar of what's still remaining in that bucket. But as opportunities come up, we're going to tumble it through the normal capital allocation thought process that we have that we've described, you know, very, very many times. And that's exactly how you think we should think about it.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSo I mean one of the reasons why we were this transparent, maybe unusually transparent with you, is that we wanted you to know that we could in the normal course pursue opportunities and yet still honor our stockholder return ambitions. We wanted to make it clear that, that you know, nothing has changed in that. That's why we put an envelope out there at the beginning so that you would have confidence that whether it was spectrum partnerships like this, other things that we would see that where we could use, you know, our know how and embedded assets to be able to extract a superior financial return and delight customers, that we would have the wherewithal to seize those things within that range.\nSo, you know, we're really pleased to have been able to bring this one to fruition, and you know, can't wait to get started once we get approval.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Jonathan. All right, operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good evening and best of luck. Jud, thanks for all the help and welcome. Cathy. Peter, I wanted to talk a little bit about margins, if I could. You had nice EBITDA growth of 8%, margins up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. I think in the past you'd sort of suggested the cadence would kind of ramp through the year.\nSo perhaps just talk a little bit about margin trajectory both this year and just longer term the opportunity. I think, Mike, you said we're just getting started here. So talk about the cost side if you could. And then maybe on spectrum, just any update you can give us on the status of the 800 MHz spectrum, given we've passed the Dish 1 April deadline, what should we expect in coming months from you in terms of auctioning that off to third parties? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWhy don't you take the first one?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, absolutely. Thanks, Simon. You know, it's a tremendously exciting story. Actually, one of the reasons, as we've talked about before, is we've now achieved as of Q4 of last year in this tremendously successful merger integration, the run rate synergies which we, you know, raised a couple times during the pendency of the deal and execution itself. And so now though we continue with this guide to see run rates, EBITDA increases that are significant, in fact quite, you know, similar to what we had during those synergy unlock days. And there's a couple of things that create that. One is continued outsized profitable share taking, of course, taking those fixed costs and leveraging the fact that we're continuing to take outsized share and turning that into outsized service revenue growth.\nSo when you have postpaid service revenue growth like we delivered this quarter of 6.5%year-over-year on a lot of fixed cost nature of the base, that obviously gives you leverage. Besides that, we're going to continue, and really it's a culture, it's kind of a flow of thinking here that we have around continued optimization efficiencies, where can we extract efficiency out of the business so that we can plow it back into customer acquisition margin expansion? Most importantly, and we've talked about this, we tend to think about it as service revenue to free cash flow conversion. That free cash flow is what unlocks all the ability for further value creating investments, whether it's spectrum purchases, whether it's capital returns.\nAnd so we're hyper focused on how do we make sure that we create efficiencies in the expense profiles and how do we make sure that in our CapEx profile we're making every single dollar count and delivering the next best tranche of value for us. And I think we have some really bespoke unique ways that we approach that. But that's how we continue to see this expansion, particularly in that service revenue to free cash flow play out over a period of time.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI hope it doesn't sound like we're sort of flogging our book when we say look at cash flow margins. You know we are, but also I think, you know, cash is king. And a view that doesn't look at cash flow margins would miss the fact that we have, we think, a durably more capital efficient strategy than our benchmark competitors. And therefore from a geography standpoint, EBITDA margins don't tell the whole story. Even though I'm pleased we're up 200 basis points almost and we're making great progress there.\nThe cash margins are the story because they are inclusive of what we think is a durably superior capital investment profile. We'll talk a lot more about what we think our secret sauce is with you at some point when we have more time. This is a strategy we have growing confidence in that it's going to be durable.\nSo, second question around 800. Well, first of all, I will just remind you what Peter, I know, has told people in the past that we chose in our business plan to be pretty conservative as it relates to how to think about the 800. And what I mean by that is we didn't include any proceeds from this auction in our financial plan so that they would be found money going into that reserve fund we were talking about a few minutes ago with Jonathan. But secondly, we also did not put the usage of that spectrum into our network planning and capacity plan. And so kind of no matter what happens here with this auction, which has begun, we either get found spectrum and capacity that we get to keep and figure out a way to use.\nThis is great spectrum nationwide, contiguous, low band, lots of interesting things we can do with it, especially with emerging technologies. But also, you know, this auction may conclude successfully and if it does, we'll have cash on hand. That enhances our profile. So what's the update? We have commenced. You know, we have interested parties, we have non binding indications of interest. There's reason to believe that we will meet the reserve. So it's a little too soon. Everything's non binding. But you know, we'll have more to say after we get past kind of the binding parts of this. So stay tuned. But you know, again, whichever way it shakes out for us, it's a win because of our conservative planning.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Mr. Barden. Your line is open on our end.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOh, perfect. Thank you so much. Congrats to Jud and Cathy. So, I guess my first question would be related to the comments in the results about how kind of going after the business market has kind of impacted the ARPU calculation, and that's been trending down for a couple quarters. So I was wondering if you could kind of maybe unpack the kind of subscriber number that we're watching evolve here and how it balances between consumer versus business. Obviously I'm obligated to ask you how free lines and other things contribute to the reported postpaid number. And the second question, if I could maybe, Mike, just to go back to this Lumos situation.\nYou're basically saying that today you're prepared to invest about $1.45 billion between now and 2028 to own 50% of basically 2.5% of the households in America. If you got 50% of that, you would have slightly around between 1% and 1.5%. What is the point? Why is it worth the brain damage to spend the money, the years building the organization to get something that looks realistically so small in the grand scheme? Thanks. Sorry.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, thanks, David. Well, let me start with the second one and then I'll hand it to Peter on the first one. Look, I'm really excited about this because I think we're getting a lot and enabling this company to accelerate growth. And if you think about, you know, close to $1.5 billion spread over time, $3.5 million passings being the goal for that funding. You know, from what we, the capital we put out, you know, that's less than $500 per passing. And to the premise of the question that's not for sort of like half of it. Because the other way it works is that T-Mobile is the branded entity for all of those passings. And you know, it's up to us to make sure that, you know, it stays that way and we perform and so on.\nBut you know, our strategy is to be able to get augmentations to an already nationwide multimillion customer broadband strategy. And this is a smart way to do that. And I signaled we're open to constructs like this around the margins. And so, you know, maybe in the end it will add up to more than this. And certainly $3.5 million isn't where this probably ends. You know, this is a growth engine that could continue into the future. We're not obligated for it to. So I love the strategy and you know, I think it's about getting a better return based on our embedded assets and complementing, you know, a complementary product that's already scaled. And that makes it very appealing for us to think about the efficiencies of how we would go to market.\nWe are the go to market entity, you know, in this construct as Lumos pivots into a wholesale model. So hopefully that, hopefully that helps. To your first question on ARPU, maybe you could unpack it a little bit vis-à-vis business versus consumer and then answer once again the age-old question of free lines and all that stuff.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US",
    "content2": "Yeah, absolutely Dave. As we've been long saying, our focus is primarily on ARPA drive accounts, land them, expand them. We just gave an updated guide with respect to ARPA both from that as well as those continuing rate plan optimizations. We'll probably see that more unfold in the second half of the year, but that trickles down into ARPU as well. So I'd say probably this year we're expecting ARPU to be up say maybe 0.5% again more weighted to the second half of the year. But it is very much, as you say, a mix driven metric. Now we don't separately disclose consumer versus business. But there's just so much, much goodness in terms of ARPA, both accounts and ARPA accretion that you would expect us to go heavily after.\nAs Callie was talking about the enterprise space and the government space where naturally ARPUs are lower, but account and CLVs and enterprise value creation is really great and strong. So you see success in, even in the consumer space with segmented consumer consumer offers like in the 55+ segment, in the military segment, once again you're willing to do lower ARPUs because you have great CLVs with those types of customers for differential reasons, each in their own segment. So we're going to continue to pursue this strategy. But again now we expect about probably 0.5% increase in ARPU. Now this whole age old free line question I understand, because there's some stuff that's happening in the industry. As you know, we don't do first free lines.\nNow we've long had a construct in our rate plan constructs that encourages higher number of lines in terms of our accounts because the higher number of lines get to be more sticky, generate more ARPA, and greater lifetime value. But there's really been no trajectory change there at all from a year-over-year sequential perspective. In fact, I would say it contributed less this Q1 than it did last Q1. But that to me is very much a rate plan construct. And again we don't do first free lines. And so that's kind of; it's not really any sort of a contributor to what you see have happened year-over-year in terms of our net add performance relative to the industry.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAll right, thank you Mike and Peter. Appreciate it.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet. Good to hear from you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the fiber. To the home strategy at a high. Level, as you look at potential future opportunities, is the goal to target areas? Where you might be underpenetrated in either fixed wireless or traditional mobile too. Kind of expand your addressable market? Or is it in part to provide an alternative for existing FWA subs to offload to a higher capacity option? Any color there would be helpful. Then secondly, just on the network. Positioning today, maybe you could talk about how you're sequencing capital to put additional spectrum to work between C-band, the DoD spectrum, 2.5 GHz refarming, AWS, just anything, any color you could provide on how you're working to maintain your network advantage, particularly as your two large peers have made further progress in building. Our mid-band spectrum.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSounds good. Well, let's start with the second one about network. I mean I am really pleased with what is happening with Ulf's team. We continue to actually extend our lead. If you look nationwide, don't look at somebody's favorite denominator, but just look nationwide at all of the customers and all of the experience that all the customers are having. We're actually pulling ahead and our average speeds are double our competitive benchmarks. And so one of the reasons for this is that it's not just looking underneath the 5G but it's looking at the availability of that 5G that for us is in so many more places reaching so many more people. And with that full Layer Cake which keeps the customers connected to 5G, all that results in a fantastic experience. Maybe you can give a little color on what's been unfolding.\nTalk about Auction 108 and how we're deploying advanced technologies.\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, thank you, Mike. And yeah, we're very excited about the network and how it keeps advancing. And you mentioned C-Band. So some of our competitors have launched C-Band and put it out there, and in the areas where they launched it, we do see that the gap between us and them narrowed a little bit, even though we are still way ahead. But as you said, we also noticed that the overall median downlink speeds, we are gaining another quarter again. And the main reason for us doing that is really the unique way we've built and constructed the network. We are the only one in the country who has three completely dedicated bands.\nTowards 5G. We have 2.5, we have 1900 now and we have 600. That gives us that big advantage together with the standalone network and the larger deployment in the footprint that we have. In fact, we have now 90% of our sites capable of 5G. We have, traffic wise, about 85% of our traffic on these tri-band sites that are all working with standalone technology and working with carrier.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nTalk more about that one. So 85% of the time people are attaching to a site with all three bands of 5G.\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nThat's right.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHow does that affect the quality of the connection and the reliability of the 5G connection?\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, very much so, because out of that we also have, and this is an even more remarkable stat, we have 93% of the traffic on mid-band, which means that there is no toggling. It just creates a much bigger, more consistent experience. There is no toggling between when you're on LTE and 5G, you're staying in 5G. The entire no toggling between low-band and mid-band. So another factor of no toggling, the other one is that we have a grid. And this is a unique thing for T-Mobile. We have a grid that is based from the beginning on a mid-band experience. So when we deploy 2.5 we get a very consistent experience between our towers as opposed to some of our competitors who has a low-band grid and therefore and a higher band on the C-Band.\nC-Band is higher than 2.5. That creates a less, more sort of interruptive, not so clear, clear and consistent experience.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThat's what we're differentiating from somebody experiencing a cell edge condition of 5G. Right. Because our grid is tighter and our spectrum reaches further. And the net effect of those two things is you're on 5G and a high quality 5G link more of the time. And 85% of the time you're seeing all three bands, where a lot of the time we use advanced carrier aggregation techniques so that you get the benefit of all those bands in terms of your signal strength. Like the uplink might be in the low band, the downlink might be in the mid band, et cetera, et cetera. And these are all advanced techniques that.\nThe rollout with our competitors is quite variable. But we're really focused on giving everybody a consistent.\n\nJon Freier\n\nPresident of Consumer Group, T-Mobile US\n\nThat's very right, Mike. It's recognized, I mean, we saw in the Ookla measurements another quarter where we came in as the overall network leader. We were also recognized by OpenSignal as having the most reliable experience. So I think those are remarkable facts showing. Then you mentioned also our 108 Auction and how quickly we deployed. It took us two weeks to get it all lit up in our entire network. You know, over a population of about 60 million, we were able to shoot up our 5G median link speeds by about 20% or a little bit more, even. So really a good result and very quickly, and shows that we can deploy spectrum very fast.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, thank you all for joining our fireside chat about networks. But I did want to make sure, because there is this kind of misnomer out there, that everybody's catching up and the party's over and it's, you know, and I've been saying this for years, we remain two years ahead of, of the party on 5G and our customers are having a radically differentiated experience. And you can see it in the data, not just in the rhetoric. So I'm really glad you asked about that. Now, there was another question, though, about fiber and where we intend to target. Look, I can't help you much on that because we don't have, we're not rolling out a plan that this is the beginning of a big wave of initiatives here.\nWe're really happy about this initiative and how it augments 5G broadband, and we intend to go public, put our energy into it. But look, I do want to remind people that this isn't a regional thing for 5G home Internet. It's really a sector by sector assessment, neighborhood by neighborhood, as to where will we have excess capacity, because that sector gets hung in order to give the kind of competitive experience that we were just coffee talking about. But then if mobile usage isn't predicted to soak up all that capacity, then individual households get approved for home broadband. And so now if those neighborhoods are neighborhoods where we roll out fiber.\nThen we can actually have some of those neighbors be added to the 5G who wouldn't otherwise be added. And that's TAM expanding potentially. But, you know, we're really focused on these things right now. Very happy to have this initiative out the door. And nothing further to report about it.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you, gentlemen.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. You bet.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThat was great. I'm sorry I didn't bring my popcorn for that one. All right, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Sam McHugh with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director and Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nYeah, afternoon, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just two on fiber to begin with, on the existing wholesale agreements you had. Can you give us any color on? What kind of penetration levels you're seeing? Kind of year one, year two, so we can think about the potential in the new JV. And then secondly, I think on FWA, I've seen some reports suggesting you might start sending notifications to people who moved the product from the home address. Do you think that'll have any impact on the kind of net adds going forward? And I guess more broadly, how should we think about that cadence of FWA through the rest of this year? Thank you very much.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you. We'll go to Mike for both questions.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing, Strategy, and Products, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, so first on the fiber question, remember, a lot of these wholesale markets that we've launched are brand new and haven't even been existing for a year. But when you heard Mike talking about the assets that T-Mobile has and how we think that those give us advantage relative to other investors, that is exactly what we're starting to see play out in these wholesale markets. Remember, at small scale, you know, we're in parts of about 16 markets spread around the country. But what we're seeing is a pace that would get us over 20% in the first year inside those markets. So we're really pleased with the penetration that we're seeing there. Now on your FWA question, and specifically earlier this week, we launched a couple of new products. And let me just give a little bit of context to those.\nMike talked about us moving over 5 million customers in our home broadband business this quarter, which obviously is a huge milestone. For us. You know, we now sit at the center of millions of homes with the most important technology in their house. We think that gives us an opportunity, and I think I've mentioned this in the last couple calls to look at opportunities to expand into other products and services inside the home as well as give us tons of insight from what we're hearing from customers of additional needs. So earlier this week we launched a program called Whole Home, which gives customers the ability to, in addition to the CPE and router that we provide in our regular HSI package, expand that and add mesh that integrates into our CPE so they can give themselves a much larger Wi-Fi footprint inside their home.\nWe also include some additional support for all the peripheral devices that attach to your network. So if you've got a laptop or a printer that you need support on, we'll offer that as part of this program. And then secondly, we offered a new program called AWAY, and I'm really excited about this one because one of the things we've heard from customers is because this is a product that only requires power. You know, we're not running a wire into your house or anything like that. It just requires power. And we see customers that want to use this on their boat, in their RV, or while they're camping. And we created a couple of new plans specifically for those use cases that allow customers to move this as their life moved along in their RV.\nThe other thing I'm really excited about in combination with that is we struck a partnership with Camping World, and Camping World, if you're not familiar with them, is the largest camping and RV retailer in the country. They're going to be partnering with us on these AWAY programs to sell to their customers and to integrate our HSI routers inside RVs that they sell.\nYou can send your orders for our new AWAY product to mike.katz. By the way, you asked one last question, which is about what we're seeing with the wholesale fiber penetration rates. It's all very early because remember, these are greenfield projects. So these were our partners starting out after the wholesale partnerships were struck. But so far so good. At a small scale, we're seeing year one penetration rates trending to 20%. That's above industry benchmarks. That's a good sign on your way to terminal penetration rates that are much higher than that. So everything we're seeing from these small scale, so far anyway, it's going to grow. But so far, small scale pilots in the wholesale range was very positive. And that's adding, of course, to our confidence to do news like today. So hopefully that covers your question. Sam.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director and Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nAwesome. Just the cadence on FWA.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nCadence. Tell me one more time what that part's about.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director and Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nAs in terms of the kind of net add development through the rest of the year, we've obviously seen some moves from T and others, kind of how we should think about growth going forward.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWe don't guide on it, but one thing we did do when we made the changes around sunsetting our launch era promotions is we indicated that this quarter would be more like 400,000 instead of the 500,000 we've seen in the past. That's what happened. You know, we delivered 405,000. We haven't guided on the rest of the year, but we've said we're well on track to the goal that we have always anticipated being by the end of 2025 in that 7 to 8 million customers range. You know what's interesting is that 405,000 net additions this quarter actually represented, as I said in my prepared remarks, a higher percentage of total broadband net adds than last year's 500 and some thousand.\nWe're sticking right in there with a very competitive more than half, that means more than all the others combined, number of net adds in the space. We're really happy with where it is because at the same time we're seeing the value of this customer base start to appreciate. And that's also important, not just through pricing or promotion sunsets, but through the kinds of value added services that Mike just summarized.\n\nSam McHugh\n\nManaging Director and Head of Telecom Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nAwesome, Mike, thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Sam. Operator. Let's squeeze in one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThat question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, US Media, Cable, and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThank you. Congratulations, Jared and Cathy. Once more. Mike, I'll try and maybe nudge you along a little bit more on your prior response on broadband. You now have scale and broadband, and you're already one of the biggest operators in this market through fixed wireless. But you seem to be hedging your comments a little bit on fiber in terms of the scale or the kind of ambitions that you might have here long term? So could you maybe talk about what the ultimate scale ambitions here are? Are you viewing this as a cheap option at this point and you want to test out the market a little bit to see where it goes, or is there a longer term vision behind this in terms of how you see the company as a whole evolving in terms of its business mix? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you. Yeah, I can say a couple things and one of them, this will be a little unsatisfying but I do plan to lay out a more long-term view on how we think about this space at our Capital Markets Day that I mentioned would be this fall because I know that people want a multi-year view. Even that view will include an element that we intend to be patient, opportunistic, and it will also include an element that says we have no interest in fundamentally changing who we are. We are a highly successful, you know, mobile business that's mobile first, that's generating superior cash flow returns in this industry because of our superior strategy. We're embarked upon a shareholder return program that we think makes a lot of sense in this piece of our life.\nSo look, you know, we're going to, we like this area for all the reasons I said on this call, but it's premature for us to lay out, you know, kind of a detailed strategy on where we expect to be. Even when I lay it out, there will be some element of it that you'll have to be patient with us because we're going to be patient, we're going to be smart, we're going to be opportunistic, you know, because we have so much confidence in our core strategy and hopefully you see that patience on our part as a sign of our confidence in our core business.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, US Media, Cable, and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior VP, Strategic Advisor, and Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, that's all the time we have for questions and we definitely appreciate everyone joining us today. It's been an absolute privilege working with you and if you have any additional questions, please reach out to either the investor relations or media relations departments. And with that, have a great day.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile First Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Q4 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\nWe provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the quarterly results section of the investor relations website. With that, let's get it over to Mike to tell us about our results.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Jud. Welcome, everybody. As you can see, if you're viewing online, I'm here with a good cross-section of our senior team once again. We're coming to you today from Bellevue, Washington, and looking forward to a great discussion. But first, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on a historic year for T-Mobile and the exciting momentum that we bring into 2024. 2023 was another year for T-Mobile of industry-leading growth in both customers and key financials, including all-time record results across many metrics. It was also a year where T-Mobile became established as the overall network leader, built on our extensive advantages in 5G.\nIt was the year that we effectively completed the biggest, arguably the most successful telecommunications merger integration in the world, delivering synergies bigger and faster than even our own ambitious goals, and doing it while also accelerating 5G investment in this country to the benefit of consumers and businesses.\nOur remarkably consistent best value, best network strategy delivered industry-leading postpaid phone net additions of 3.1 million in 2023. This was driven by our highest postpaid phone gross adds in company history, up 2% for the year and up 6% in Q4, and by our lowest postpaid phone churn in company history for the year. Our net adds essentially matched our great results from 2022, despite industry postpaid phone net adds decreasing year-over-year. You know what that means?\nIt means that our unique formula enabled us to take a higher share of postpaid phone net adds than a year ago. In fact, 2023 was our highest share of postpaid phone net adds since the merger, showing the ongoing durability of our differentiated strategy. And we finished the year on a high note with Q4 postpaid phone net adds of 934,000, highest in the industry by a wide margin.\nAnd we did it with rising ARPA, up almost 2%, delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid service revenue, and Core EBITDA in Q4, while also nearly doubling our adjusted free cash flow. Let's talk about broadband. We added over 2.1 million customers in 2023, our biggest growth year yet, with more net new customers than the other largest providers combined. As our product just continues to resonate in the market.\nAnd we finished strong with 541,000 net adds in Q4, making us one of the largest ISPs in the nation, with 4.8 million customers and counting at year-end. At T-Mobile, our network is the key enabler of our growth, not only for the success that we've had to date, but also for years to come.\nI predicted years ago that our well-established 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that was proven loud and clear in 2023 by leading third parties like Ookla and Opensignal time and again, with T-Mobile sweeping every category of their tests for overall network performance. Listen, it boils down to this: T-Mobile has the broadest and the deepest and the most advanced 5G network in the US today, and we have the assets and capabilities to further extend our network leadership in 2024 and beyond. Okay, one final network point.\nWe recently celebrated a pivotal moment in our groundbreaking alliance with SpaceX by kicking off testing of direct satellite-to-cellular communications. Our teams are really excited about what's coming. Let me just remind you of one thing: our network leadership still isn't yet fully recognized by millions of network seekers who are still potential future customers for T-Mobile.\nAnd yet that same network leadership is already driving our strong win share, particularly in underpenetrated areas like enterprise and government, and also in smaller markets and rural areas in our consumer business. Let me just double-click on that growth momentum. T-Mobile for Business delivered the highest postpaid phone net adds in company history in 2023, and we exited the year with great momentum, with Q4 being our highest quarterly net adds ever.\nMeanwhile, in our consumer group, we continued to grow our share of households, both in smaller markets and rural areas, where we are well on our way to our 2025 targets, and even in the top 100 markets, where we grew our share year-over-year on the strength of our network and our compelling value proposition. We're executing our balanced growth playbook with great and consistent success.\nAnd the best part is we still have a lot of room to run. All of this added up to delivering the highest consolidated service revenue growth in the industry in 2023. And it was an industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. On that all-important postpaid service revenue metric, we delivered 6% growth in 2023, way above our next closest competitor.\nThat growth led to Core Adjusted EBITDA growth of over 10% and free cash flow growth of nearly 80%. All of this enables our substantial stockholder return model, which has returned $17 billion to stockholders so far through the end of 2023, including our first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4.\nNow, Peter will share our guidance with you in a moment, but the short version is this: we see continued strong customer and revenue growth translating into rapid growth in cash flows in 2024 and beyond, and supporting our ambitious plans for shareholder returns that we've already shared with you. Before I wrap up, because this is a year-end report, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a connected world where everyone can thrive. We believe reliable and affordable wireless and internet service is a necessity for all in today's highly connected and digital world.\nThat's why we are so proud to have connected nearly six million students and provided $6.4 billion in products and services so far under our flagship initiative, Project 10Million, and our other education initiatives. We've also partnered with Welcome.US to provide service through Metro by T-Mobile to refugees entering the US as part of a multi-year commitment of 200,000 lines.\nIt is difficult to imagine restarting a new life in a new country without the connectivity that most of us take for granted. We are also working hard to create a more sustainable future, and we are proud to be the first US wireless provider to commit to achieving net zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040, using SBTi's Net-Zero Standard. All right, let me just wrap up with why I am so excited about what's ahead.\nWe are now entering a period of tremendous value creation at T-Mobile, driven by ongoing growth leadership and by having completed both a historic merger and a massive 5G network build that are foundational to unlocking the cash flow potential of this business. Our network is now a differentiated competitive advantage that complements our well-established value leadership.\nThis unique and powerful formula means that our significant growth and value creation opportunities only continue to scale, and they have lots of room to run. As we enter 2024 with momentum, I could not be more proud of this team and of our employees who remind us every day that it's better over here at T-Mobile. All right, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights, as well as our 2024 guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, Mike. As you can see, our 2023 results highlighted our strong execution in accelerating our merger integration while leveraging our network leadership and fame for value to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. Our land and expand strategy also led to industry-leading growth in postpaid account net adds, as well as ARPA growth of 1.3%.\nBefore I jump into our guidance, I would also like to take a moment to note a couple of items impacting our Q4 earnings per share. In December 2023, we issued 48.8 million shares to SoftBank as the 45-day VWAP of our stock price reached the threshold price under the letter agreement from 2020. This obviously increased our share count, which impacted our diluted EPS, as it is treated as if those shares had been issued for the full quarter.\nWe expect that dilution to be more than offset by our ongoing share repurchases in 2024. We also accelerated depreciation on certain technology assets in Q4 and would anticipate a year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $500 million to $1 billion in full year 2024 as we continue to modernize our network and technology systems and platforms.\nMike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top line and the bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into how we expect that growth to continue in 2024. Starting with customers, we expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, the same starting guidance as last year, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated strategy, even while expecting total industry net additions to moderate.\nThis assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds will be phones. The guidance also assumes the final portion of deactivations of our lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector, with most of that impact already having been accelerated into the second half of 2023. As we noted last quarter, we had always anticipated many of these connections, which supported educational institutions through the pandemic, would roll off as the emergency connectivity program wound down and things returned to normal.\nTurning to Core Adjusted EBITDA, we expect it to be between $31.3 and 31.9 billion, up nearly 9% year-over-year at the midpoint and above the midpoint of our capital markets day guidance for 2024. This is three times the growth rate of peers and a year-over-year dollar increase comparable to what we delivered in 2023, despite no material incremental merger synergy benefits in 2024.\nOur sustained growth represents the power of our industry-leading service revenue growth, the operating leverage of our profitable growth model, and the opportunity to continue to drive operating efficiencies in the business. We would expect slightly different shaping across the quarters now that we are past the integration.\nFor example, we would expect slightly less sequential improvement from Q4 2023 to Q1 of this year than we saw last year as we achieved full run rate synergies in Q4 2023 and no longer have that as an incremental sequential factor as we had in past Q4 to Q1 progressions. We would expect the operating leverage and efficiencies that drive EBITDA this year to build throughout the year, layered against the seasonal trends of the business.\nWe expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in the industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. Our pull forward of CapEx into 2022 and 2023 has provided us with a broad multi-layer 5G network on which we can now deploy additional spectrum for capacity across those existing radios without material incremental CapEx required.\nOur capital-efficient and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Our expectations for free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, is in the range of $16.3 to 16.9 billion. This is up approximately 22% over last year at the midpoint and five times the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nThis also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. We expect Q1 free cash flow to be approximately 20% of that full year midpoint, given several items that fall early in the year. First, we expect Q1 to be the peak CapEx quarter at probably 30% of the full year midpoint of the CapEx guidance I just shared with you.\nSecond, we expect approximately half of the $600 to 700 million of anticipated full year 2024 cash merger-related costs to be in Q1. Third, we have cash severance for workforce actions taken late last year, and the monthly payments to Cogent following the wireline sale will taper after April. Finally, there are working capital seasonality elements coming off the higher holiday sales period.\nAnd finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 2% in 2024, further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023. In closing, we expect 2024 to be another year of profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities.\nWe expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, Core Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, delivering the highest free cash flow margin in the industry to unlock shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud?\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. Let's get to your questions. You can ask a question via phone by pressing star, then one, and via X by sending a tweet to @T-Mobile IR or @MikeSievert using hashtag TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe first question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nMD, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more update on where you are on some of the smaller markets in terms of your market share gain and how that's factoring into your guide for this year, and the same sort of thing for enterprise and government. Where are we in that status? And perhaps on fixed wireless, it was a strong result despite some seasonality. Where are you in terms of exploring additional capacity options on a cost-effective manner? Thanks.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Well, let's start with smaller markets and rural areas. Jon, why don't you jump in?\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, you bet. Hi, Simon. I'm just delighted with what's happening here in smaller markets and rural areas. I've been talking to all of you about this since our Analyst Day event back in March of 2021. Back in that time, we were at a 13% share of household position. We set this incredibly ambitious goal to get to 20% by the end of the year 2025 across the entire segment, which, by the way, is 140 million people, 40% of the US, about 50 million households.\nI updated you last time when we, during our Q3 earnings report, about our share-taking progress in those markets and some of the really good results that we're seeing. I'm pleased to tell you that we've now arrived at a share of household position in smaller markets of rural areas of about 17.5%.\nAnd so I'm really, really pleased by that. And the last time I talked to you about this was about nine months ago, and we were at 16.5%, so a full percentage point since that time. And when you look at what we're doing with the 5G network build that Ulf and his team have been doing, the distribution expansion, and bringing this incredible marketing infrastructure out to smaller markets and rural areas, people are just loving what we're doing.\nWe're having a lot of fun doing it. And I got to tell you that it looks like we're really in a place where we can achieve that 20% goal by 2025 based on where we are. But I'm really more excited, and I think the more compelling opportunity is what we can do beyond the 20%.I don't have anything to tell you about right here, right now about that, but I tell you, I'm getting really excited about what we can be doing beyond this 20% goal as you think about our continued velocity in these particular markets.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAbsolutely. Great, Jon. And also on fixed wireless, the product is just really resonating. Maybe, Mike, you can say what some of the things that we're doing is to respond to this ongoing growth and the acceptance of the product in the marketplace.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. I mean, one thing that is kind of just amazing when you look back at it, we've essentially been in the market with our fixed wireless product for two years. In two years, we've gone from a launch product to what you saw at the end of Q4, which is nearly five million customers on fixed wireless, making us one of the largest ISPs in America with a product that still leads versus every other industry in customer satisfaction.\nSo we're really proud of what's been built here and continued momentum. We saw gross adds this year, the highest they've ever been. So we have a lot of demand for this product. One of the decisions you saw us recently take was reverting back to our standard pricing in our fixed wireless product.\nWe've been so moving away from our promotional pricing that we've been on for the last two years to our standard pricing, which we put into market earlier this month. We think that still offers the best value inside the broadband business and the best experience as demonstrated by the NPS scores that I just talked about. We think there's still room to grow in HSI with a 5 million customer base, still a runway in front of us to grow, both in new customers, but also in services. We think having a 5 million customer broadband base gives us the opportunity to bring more services into the home, which the team is actively exploring.\nAnd then finally, Simon, and not to steal your thunder, Ulf, just to make the short version, we haven't drawn any new conclusions versus what we previously told you about possible models beyond this initial capital light model that we have for high-speed internet. As you know, our forecasts all along have said that model takes us to 7 to 8 million subscribers. We're well on our way. We'll monitor that as we get closer. And we've got a lot of time left. So stay tuned if we're able to provide you with an update on that in the future, but no update today.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nMD, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, Simon.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nI'll play your next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nHi, Craig.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nYeah, hi. Thank you. Yeah, hi. Thank you. You just talked about the pricing of FWA and the move to your standard pricing. I wonder if you could just talk about the outlook for pricing of your mobile service as well? How do you see ARPU playing out over the course of 2024? And there's been a lot of talk that we're in a market where prices are rising generally. Could we sort of think about baking that into our expectations for the coming year?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, Craig. A couple of things. First of all, you heard Peter guide, a confident guide on 2% growth in ARPA on the year. That's terrific to see. Obviously, there's this ongoing trend that customers who buy T-Mobile can't get enough of it, and they're moving up our rate card. That's great to see. We're in a great spot.\nBefore I say more about what opportunities we might see, I'll remind everybody listening that we're in an era of unprecedented value that consumers and businesses are realizing from this category generally. I've mentioned previously that typically today across the category, not just at T-Mobile, customers are getting three times more data than just five years ago and at four times greater speeds industry-wide than five years ago. There's tremendous value being given to customers in this category.\nAnd if there are ways for us to find optimizations in terms of how we deliver that enormous value so that we can be more competitive and more efficient at how we operate, including looking in our rate card, looking at our rate plans, and looking at our policies and procedures, we'll find those opportunities. Q4, we took some of those opportunities. We found a more efficient way to handle autopay discounts with our customers and fully put that through the base throughout Q4. And that's an important optimization.\nRight now, taking a lead from Netflix as they've changed their portfolio, we've made changes to the Netflix benefits that we give, which have been well accepted by customers. So there's a theme here. We may find optimizations, but we will be guided by a couple of things. One, what customers accept and appreciate, because that's really important.\nNumber two, we have no intentions of sacrificing our brand position as the value leader in terms of what you get for what you pay in this marketplace. That's always been a differentiator for us, and we will defend that jealously. But I'll tell you, there's opportunities that could be there in an era of unprecedented value being seen by consumers and businesses. If we can take those and meet those guidelines that I've laid out, we'll do so.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. And Craig, with respect to ARPU, I mean, as we've talked about multiple times, it's very much a mix-driven metric. And on the consumer side, we have seen continued growth in ARPU. Now, that's offset with some of the success and tremendous value creation that we've had in enterprise and government. Those are obviously lower ARPU customers with high CLVs, larger ARPAs.\nAnd so that's why the focus on, one, the customer value differential that we're bringing and our ARPA playbook, we believe, is the right way to go. And you can see that demonstrated in what we delivered in 2023 and Q4 from a postpaid service revenue perspective. That's where you're kind of focused in with postpaid ARPU. And frankly, what we see from a service revenue opportunity in 2024 is even larger percentage growth than what we delivered in 2023.\nMore than the 3.1% full year growth we'll see in 2024, despite, of course, some slight ongoing headwinds in wholesale with the offset of TracFone and other carriers. We couldn't be more excited about this as the right playbook that delivers the most value creation in the industry.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nThanks, guys. Actually, just a few sort of housekeeping questions, actually. I'm wondering if you can give us what the number of ACP subs in your base is and whether you're sort of anticipating using some of those if the benefit goes away, and how that sort of factors into guidance. And then ditto on bonus depreciation. If bonus depreciation gets extended, how would that impact your free cash flow guidance? Thanks so much.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI'll start on ACP and hand it to Peter to finish on ACP and take the bonus depreciation question. When it comes to the number of subscribers in our reported base, it's substantially none. There's a very, very small amount of Metro customers, and that's it. So it's constrained to our Assurance Wireless business, which is not reported as subscribers, and to our wholesale business.\nAnd as it relates to ACP and what's happening to it, obviously, that's in motion. You may have noticed that our EBITDA guide was a tiny bit wider this year. I would tell you that all the outcomes that we see for ACP are fully embedded in the guide that we gave you on EBITDA. And look, our risk profile around ACP is a little different than, say, a broadband company. They went very big into it, committed lots of customers and numbers to it.\nAnd also, I think on subscribers that may or may not stick around. Mobile is different. Mobile is a product that customers will keep. And if they lose that discount, our job, and I think our team's up to the task, is to go win them over with our high-value offers.\nAnd we have some of the best brands in the space with incredible value propositions. And as other wireless providers see the same thing happen, we will get after it and position our brands as the place that those people land. So there's a risk profile around it for T-Mobile, but I think much smaller than with other players, and it's fully embedded in the guidance. That said, I'll let Peter pick up there as well as talk about the bonus depreciation.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. And just housekeeping-wise, again, we don't participate in ACP on the postpaid side. We have a little immaterial amount through Metro, and the rest assurance isn't reported in our subscriber counts. And of course, wholesale customers are not either. So that's it with respect to ACP. And on bonus depreciation, look, we're continuing to monitor the developments.\nAnd of course, we're very supportive of a tax regime that stimulates investment into the network, into US leadership on this front. With regards to 2024, we're not anticipating to be a significant cash taxpayer, so it wouldn't impact the guide for 2024. And we'll see where it goes. And of course, as it develops, we could update you later in the year for outer years.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nHey, John.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Hey, good afternoon. Hey, if we could talk a little bit about competition, that'd be great. I guess we can take it from both sides. First, from a gross adds standpoint, you guys saw some acceleration in phone gross adds quarter to quarter, so just what you're seeing in terms of sort of competitive offers in the market in the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter. And then on the other side, churn kicked up for the first time in a while, I think. So what's potentially driving that in terms of postpaid phone churn? And do you expect it to remain elevated or keep moving in that direction? Or what should we expect there? Thanks.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nI'll start on churn and maybe hand it to Mike on competition. Churn was up nine basis points sequentially. If you look at the last several years since we completed the merger, from Q3 to Q4, the average is 10 basis points sequentially. It's right in line, maybe even a little better than past sequential moves. Our business tends to be seasonal, with Q4 being a higher time period of churn.\nThat being said, I was really pleased with getting the nine basis points given some of the optimizations that were fully implemented in Q4 that I mentioned in response to an earlier question. Look, there's no question in my mind that we are on a journey towards the best churn in this industry. That's because we have the best value, the best network, and a history of being able to treat customers with respect.\nAnd so we'll find that journey making its way. 2024 is going to be an interesting year because, as I mentioned earlier, there are optimizations across the board that we may find are in our best interest to take as long as they don't put at risk our superior value proposition, as long as there are things that will be well accepted or even appreciated by customers.\nAnd so I can't give you specifics on the guide. I can tell you that with this churn, nine basis points higher sequentially, we delivered a big beat in postpaid net additions on phones of 934,000, bigger than we guided even during the middle of the quarter. And so we're very comfortable with the formula. And we're comfortable with the formula in part because competition has been remarkably consistent. I'll let Mike talk about what we're seeing.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. This has always been a really competitive environment and industry and dynamic and competitive. Honestly, that's the way we like it. For us, when there's lots of competition and customers are looking around shopping, T-Mobile ends up being the net winner. And you see that both in 2023 and in Q4 specifically with T-Mobile having the highest share of net adds.\nAnd you saw it consistently throughout the year with the account growth that T-Mobile posted, which was highest by far in the industry. What we saw in Q4, I would describe as generally consistent with what we saw last year. Offers were pretty much the same. Very aggressive, but pretty consistent with previous year. I think what's been different is the way that T-Mobile or what's evolved, maybe I should say, is the way that T-Mobile competes.\nMike and Peter both talked about this value proposition we have of best value, which historically has always been the thing that T-Mobile's owned, and then more recently developed the best network. Those two things together really create a unique value proposition that's unmatched in the industry and is resonating with customers. You saw it again in Q4. You continue to see us enhance it as we did this year with the launch of the Go5G plans, the launch of Phone Freedom, which in a shopping time like Q4 as customers are looking to upgrade, we think really resonated, and you saw it in the net add performance.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet. Thanks, John.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, John. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions if I could. First, when you look at the Core EBITDA margin profile, are you still targeting to get to a margin at or above 50%? And how do you see the pacing to get there? And then second, was there anything specific that influenced the pace of share buyback dollars? I think it was down a little bit year-over-year, down sequentially. And maybe put that into the context of your current capital return goals that you highlighted a few months back. Thanks.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. Let's start with Core EBITDA and Core EBITDA margin. Peter.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. Well, Mike, certainly our long-run aspiration is to continue to see margin expansion in Core EBITDA. But much like you see us focus, really the primary focus here is to continue to be the leader and continue expanding in our ability to deliver free cash flow margin relative to service revenue because that takes out all the noise of relative differentials and how P&Ls are recognized, backhaul, etc., and really provides a true color for value creation. And that's where we're already in a leadership position and continue to see more expansion opportunity there.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGreat. And you obviously saw us in Q4 take some investments to make sure that we could have a beat on customers and revenues. And that's just helping with our confident guide in 2024. So when we see opportunities like that, we take them. We've talked with you many times about that in the past. Second question was about share buybacks. What happened in Q4? There was a little bit of a slowdown. What are we seeing now? What do people expect?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. Naturally, Mike, I think what you saw was a little bit of a tapering. We're not going to talk about day-to-day dynamics, but a little bit of a tapering of the share buyback program as we were nearing that issuance and that trigger point of the SoftBank share. So we're past that now. I think we're confident in our ability to deliver what we've signed up for here, which is another incremental up to $16 billion currently authorized in share buybacks and dividends for 2024 and pacing towards that.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet. Thanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I just wanted to touch on the cost side of the business. I know you mentioned you're at your target merger synergy run rate, and you had the headcount reduction earlier this year. What other initiatives are on the table to kind of help you keep moving leverage up in the business, either on the technology side in distribution of small markets or anything else that you could comment on? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. I'll just start by kind of reminding everybody that, as Peter already pointed out, the 2024 guide at the midpoint is higher than our earlier capital markets day guide. It's 9% year-over-year, which is three times the expectation of our peers. It's really terrific to see this business scaling and without the incremental year-over-year benefit of big expansions and synergies. That's mostly behind us almost entirely. That's really great to see. Obviously comes from ongoing progression of valuable customers, some of the best customers with the best payment records in the industry, as well as efficiencies that we can see in how we run the business.\nYeah. And onto that, as we said, a big part of this is also the service revenue growth leadership that we anticipate, that we expect to actually increase in 2024 on a growth basis relative to 2023. And then it's across the business. I mean, we've made tremendous investments as we are expanding the network, as we are expanding distribution. We're reaping some of that.\nBut make no mistake, this is a very scrappy team that's looking at not only just currently where can you continue to drive efficiencies, but how do you take advantage of network modernization, of technology modernization, of all the buzzwords that you hear these days around AI and other things, but how do you do it in an uncarrier fashion with the customer at the center of it while driving efficiencies out of the business? So we see a lot of room to run here over a multi-year arc on this front.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nThe next question is from Bryan Kraft at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good afternoon. I had two, if I could. First, could you talk a little bit about your expectations for upgrade rates as they relate to this year's free cash flow guidance? Do you think these low upgrade rates we're seeing across the industry are going to begin to tick up anytime soon?\nAnd are you doing anything proactively in retention that might drive it up? And then separately, Mike, you mentioned that you're in testing with SpaceX on their direct-to-device solution. When you do get to the commercial deployment of the service, just curious as to what your expectations are for the product's capabilities for customers, how it fits into the product set, and also if you have any sense for how much of your base this feature or this capability is actually important to you. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nTerrific. Great. Well, let's start with upgrade rates. We don't see big catalysts for change here. Around the edges, there may be some, and we can talk about those. For example, we have a brand new rate plan called Go5G Next, which offers upgrade benefits, could change it on the margin, and other things.\nBut generally speaking, people are keeping their phones longer. And they're doing that because the phones are very expensive and they're very capable. For our customers, 75% of them have 5G phones that are able to take advantage of the vast majority of our advanced network capabilities that we already have implemented. And so those kinds of things are a great position to be in. And I don't think there's a big catalyst for change in 2024. As it relates to SpaceX, yeah, we're really excited about it.\nAnd way back when we announced it, we talked about the capabilities starting with text messaging, peer-to-peer text messaging, the ability to reach people if you can see the sky. We expect it to cover the continental US, big parts of Alaska, big parts of the world's oceans, and be able to allow you to stay in connection with your loved ones. That'll progress into picture messaging and eventually talk and other capabilities.\nAnd the beta, we expect, if things go well, we should have these capabilities in customer hands this year. As it relates to who it appeals to, look, anybody that finds themselves on occasion in one of the 500,000 sq mi in this country not covered by any of the networks. And that's most of us.\nThere's something about the peace of mind of knowing that if you can see the sky, generally speaking, you're connected. That's our dream. That's the aspiration that we set out when we announced this partnership. It's great to have the first satellites in the sky.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Kanan Venkateshwar for Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, US Media, Cable and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThank you. Two if I could. First is on fixed wireless. Earlier in the year, I guess in 2023, I think we all thought that the second derivative might slow down a little bit. And in terms of growth rates, it might be closer to 500,000. But when we look at the second half of the year, it feels like there is still some second derivative growth left.\nAnd so it would be great to understand if this is demand-driven or to some extent, as you open up spectrum and as your distribution channels become more efficient, this is more supply-driven. So it would be good to understand the mix of what's driving that growth. And then secondly, on the ACP side, sorry, one more housekeeping question. I mean, as you explained, I mean, it's not a big impact, and it's mostly on the wholesale side.\nThe general article today mentioned some of the wholesale providers and their exposures, which seemed pretty big. I think some of them use your network. This is a high-margin revenue stream. Is there any way for us to understand if there is any timeline around when we might see this? As you mentioned, it's not material. Maybe it doesn't matter in the full year scheme of things, but I don't know if it changes the cadence of EBITDA in any way.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Great. We don't know whether it'll be material, but we do know that and are reasonably confident that it's fully embedded within all of the outcomes that we provided in our guidance range to you. But let's start with fixed wireless and go to Mike. And then, Mike, if you want to transition to what we're seeing with ACP, and Peter will probably pile on.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. I think on the fixed wireless side, like I mentioned earlier, we've seen steady demand for this product since it's launched. And a lot of the things that you mentioned are absolutely true. Our execution has gotten better. We have built more stores. So we've got distribution closer to customers in areas like rural areas. There's more awareness of the product both generally and in the overall market, but also within our base. All of those things certainly have been factors.\nI think the other big thing that's been a factor is churn because remember the net additions are the difference between gross adds and the number of customers that churn. And we've seen a steady improvement with churn with HSI year-over-year, really across every single tenure cohort. We knew that churn would come down as our base aged and got into later cohorts, which we see the later cohorts of customers in this churn at a rate that's pretty comparable with cable.\nSo we knew that churn would come down as our base aged. But what's really exciting is as the product has improved itself, as the experience has improved, and frankly, as our execution has improved, even the early tenure cohort churn has started to reduce. And we've seen that consistently throughout the year.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. I would just add on to that to your point. Remember, we're well on our way to our seven to eight million target and hence some of the moves we made to really optimize value creation. So I'd probably expect on a quarterly basis, nets might be in the 400,000 range, which is really what you need to get to that ambition while creating more value given some of the promotional pricing that we've now pared back.\nOn ACP, I think the important element is we'll see where it goes. But our anticipation with everything that Mike highlighted around the category itself is the outcomes, inclusive of should ACP not continue on, is embedded in the Core EBITDA guidance range that we provided, as well as in our expectation that service revenue growth will be larger in full year 2024 than 2023. So that's all embedded in the guidance that we provided.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, US Media, Cable and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you.\nAll right.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead.\n\nRic Prentiss (Raymond James an\n\nManaging Director, Director of Telecommunications Services Research Telecommunications Services\n\nGood afternoon. I want to follow along those same lines a little bit. Can you help us understand? Obviously, TracFone's coming off. There could be some DISH coming off on the wholesale side as well. How much magnitude should we be expecting wholesale might drop this year knowing that you have some ranges out there?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. We haven't specifically guided to that. And remember, we have a little bit of visibility given some of the MPGs, which do trail off with respect to DISH. But I'd expect a continued year-over-year sequential decline, but not a specific guide on wholesale.\n\nRic Prentiss (Raymond James an\n\nManaging Director, Director of Telecommunications Services Research Telecommunications Services\n\nThat's obviously factored into the guidance that we've provided.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nRic Prentiss (Raymond James an\n\nManaging Director, Director of Telecommunications Services Research Telecommunications Services\n\nThen any update on Mint? What's been going on, what, 10, 11 months? What is their position on ACP?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. So Mint, we anticipate Mint to close in Q1. And that is included in the guide itself. And of course, that'll result once it does close in a little bit of service revenue and cost geography changes with minimal net impact to Core EBITDA, as we talked about earlier. But all of that, including ACP contemplation, is considered in the guide that we gave. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to speak specifically about Mint as we haven't closed yet.\n\nRic Prentiss (Raymond James an\n\nManaging Director, Director of Telecommunications Services Research Telecommunications Services\n\nLast one for me is you talked a lot about your net adds doing strong, service revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, particularly versus the peer group. Will we ever hear you guys talk about EPS? Because clearly the peer group talks EPS as well. I know your footnotes say there's some things that make it tough, but will there be someday where you think about talking to us about an EPS guide?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. I think that day will come. Obviously, we're still in this period. In 2023, we had significant merger-related costs. We're going to have a little bit of merger-related costs in 2024, probably 150 in Q1 and 50 in Q2. But you are going to see us have more and more focus on EPS. And obviously, there was a couple, as I mentioned, a couple of catalysts, including the 48.8 million shares for Q4.\nBut you'll see us more and more focused on EPS. Look, the margin expansion is going to flow into the bottom line. And you'll see us there. We're not quite there yet. A little bit more work to do with the merger-related costs and other things, but it's definitely something we keep an eye on, and it's important. The shareholder return program that we have underway really helps with it overall. Despite this dilution event that we saw, the overall trend is anti-dilution as we retire shares through the program. It's a good trend to be on.\n\nRic Prentiss (Raymond James an\n\nManaging Director, Director of Telecommunications Services Research Telecommunications Services\n\nThanks.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right. We got a lot of activity on social. Janice, you want to tell us what we're seeing?\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US",
    "content2": "Yeah. I think there's one we're seeing this theme in a few places. So we'll take this question. It says, \"First of all, congratulations on a great year. But could you provide more color on your enterprise business, especially beyond connectivity, revenue, and traction?\" And I know we haven't really covered that yet.\nCallie. Okay. Well, thanks, Janice. And let me just tell you, we're in a different phase in our business. Last year, my leaders transformed the talent and activity of our sales team. And we've upgraded our product portfolio with solutions like T-SIMsecure and our connected workplace managed services with Cisco Meraki that we just announced yesterday.\nWe've moved from transacting with lower-level procurement employees to sitting at the table with CIOs as their trusted partners for connectivity solutions. And also, business customers, as we talked about before, they test our network before purchasing. And what they find is the most modern, the most distributed, nationwide, tri-band 5G Standalone commercially available for slicing network, and they've determined its superiority. And all of this translates right back into our core business. So we delivered on our highest quarter and year ever in business postpaid phone net additions and gross adds.\nOur results outperformed our benchmark competitor once again. In enterprise, we delivered our highest win share rate with postpaid phone net additions. Our results allowed us to bring on new customers like Salesforce and REI, and deepen our relationships with Delta, DoorDash, Meta, and UPS, just to name a few. In the public sector, we drove double-digit growth in our new public safety accounts, especially with first responders who recognize that we at T-Mobile provide a more secure, prioritized connection over a faster and larger network.\nWe continue to grow and compete successfully in small businesses, best quarter and year yet, and saw positive porting trends versus both of our principal competitors in the third consecutive quarter in a row. We're bringing in, as Peter mentioned earlier, both highly profitable customers with attractive CLVs.\nAnd as it relates to revenue outside of phones, we also saw some key wins in our advanced network solutions this past quarter with Formula 1 in Las Vegas, where we successfully demonstrated our commercial application of network slicing with 230 points of sale. That was incredible, Ulf. Also signed a deal with PGA of America where we're the official 5G innovation partner enhancing how players and fans both experience the game. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight on what we're seeing.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIt's kind of neat to see that if you just listen to that, that essentially our whole business effort has just kind of grown up. And we're now competing to solve really important organizational problems for enterprise and government with the corner office.\nAnd that's just a different place for us. And it's been interesting to see you've had to retool all the skills and the capabilities and the solutions. And now we have this business that is just breaking records. And there's a lot of room to run because we're at the very beginning, I think, of CIOs and organizational leaders rethinking their connectivity in the era of AI. And when they start to assess who's best positioned in this era to provide reliable, secure connectivity with dedicated spectrum, it's T-Mobile.It's just we're lucky to be in this moment, at the very moment that everyone's rethinking everything in technology, thanks to the advent of AI and related technologies. It's a great place to be.\n\nOperator\n\nLet's go back to the phones. The next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst of Media and Entertainment and Telecom and Cable, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thank you. I was wondering two things. One about fixed wireless. You talked a bit about a slowing net add growth rate still obviously at a really attractive level with better price and value for you. I wondered as you get closer to your target, thinking out a couple of years, do you manage this business at a high rate of speed right up to the target and then slam on the brakes, or is there some organizational benefit to a more gradual deceleration? And then the second question relates to postpaid phone ARPU. I know that you're not guiding to it. And just wondered if you could discuss the drivers in 2024 and how they might differ from 2023. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSounds good. I'll take the first one and then maybe hand it to Peter. As we said in response to an earlier question, it's kind of too early to tell what's going to happen as we start to get towards that initial goal for our fixed wireless business of seven to eight million subscribers, as John reminded us. And right now, we want to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with a fantastic product at a fair price, and we start to ease our way towards that moment. But we also don't know, as we said earlier, whether that's really the final destination or not, whether or not there may be other models that allow us to extend past that. And so look, we'll learn more with each passing quarter.\nBut I think the moves we've made that Mike outlined, I think, well, a few minutes ago, this is the right time for them to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with our great product, we're meeting the demand appropriately, and that we're correctly monetizing it so that we're able to continue serving customers in the best possible way. So I'm really happy with where we are.\nThe demand for this product, based on the quality of the product, has just been phenomenal. And I think a lot of it now is word of mouth because that's what happens when you get 4.8 million customers using this product every day at very high, nearly the best in the industry, Net Promoter Scores. Well, what do they do? They tell other people that they've discovered something great, and that just feeds on itself.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst of Media and Entertainment and Telecom and Cable, Wolfe Research\n\nSo that's a really good place to be. Secondly, unpacking ARPU, and is there anything different in the dynamics for 2024 versus 2023?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. In 2024, we'd expect to be generally stable to 2023. In terms of dynamics, it's going to be the same set of dynamics. You have growth in high-value creating enterprise and government customers. You have growth in tremendously great CLV segment customers like 55+ and military on the consumer side, which Jon is just seeing tremendous success with. You're going to see uptake of our highest tier, highest value rate plans continue at a great clip. Then it just becomes a mixed-driven metric. Again, we tend to solve for ARPA, ARPA growth, and overall service revenue growth as the focus point. It's going to be more of the same with regards to ARPU.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst of Media and Entertainment and Telecom and Cable, Wolfe Research\n\nYou bet. Thanks, gentlemen.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet. Hopefully, you can tell we're trying to get to absolutely as many questions as we can this time. So let's keep moving.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Horan\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, guys. You had a goal a few years ago of a 15-fold increase in wireless capacity. Can you give us an update kind of where we are at this point and just what 5G has meant for maybe latency or anything else with the network? And I know you touched on network slicing. What was Formula 1 and PGA doing kind of before you kind of came along for wireless capacity? How much of an improvement was this at this point? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, first, on overall capacity, it's a good opportunity to turn it to Ulf, and maybe you can say what we're seeing now that we're substantially complete with the initial build.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. Thanks a lot, Mike. And thanks for the question. Well, overall, the network capacity on this fantastic network is outstanding and keeps increasing on 5G as we are pivoting over frequency from our LTE customers over to 5G. And we keep doing that all the time. That's why we can stay ahead of the curve, both with our HSI customers being inside that mobile umbrella, but also making sure that we have enough capacity to grow for all the traffic growth on the network.\nAnd as Mike alluded to earlier, we just see an increasing usage. People use more and more of the goodness that we provide. I'll also say that this is across our entire geography. We have to remember that our network is much, much larger in size than 5G, than any of our competitors in this country.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWe have on our 5G coverage more than twice the area of our closest competitor on our ultra capacity, which is what provides all that capacity. When it comes to the second question, which was around network slicing in Las Vegas, and as Callie alluded to, this was a true success story. We were the only operator in the world or in the country that could provide a true beta version because of our standalone core that we have in this network of network slicing. In other words, we can program our network to make sure that services work while all the other services and serving all the other customers on the network at the same time.\nWe were able to provide network slicing during the start of the race, which meant that we could both make sure that all those points of sale had full service to everything they were doing at the same time as 100,000 customers per day were using our network during that start of the race, watching their apps, doing all the activities that they would be doing.\nThis has almost never happened in Formula 1 history. It's normally very congested, very difficult to do anything when so many customers are accessing the network at the same time. That's what network slicing was proving to do in Las Vegas. It's just starting early to come. We're going to roll these kinds of things out to much more events in the future.\n\n[Company Representative] (T-Mobile US)\n\nCompany Representative, T-Mobile US\n\nAs it relates to your specific question. As it relates to your specific question on the 15x, I actually don't have the answer at my fingertips. So I'm going to look into that. I can tell you that when we made that estimate, what we had in mind were the commercial results that we have delivered in spades, being able to see phone usage grow the way it has grown at T-Mobile. It's now more than triple what it was five years ago, four times the speed, and then some, and being able to handle this massive home broadband business on top, as well as all the growth that we see in enterprise.\nSo as we laid out this network way back in 2018 and planned it, we have met every single expectation that we laid out there, including some stringent commitments that we made to the FCC as part of the merger process, and just completed a massive nationwide drive in order to be able to make those goals.\nSo I would be surprised if it's anything other than the 15x has been achieved, but I'll have to double-check on that. As it relates to the F1, it's fascinating you hear Ulf talking about network slicing and what it's doing for people. And there have been lots of applications. We talk about F1 because it's very public, and it's going to be a great case study for all of our executive briefing center visits, etc. But there have been lots of these now.\nAnd look, your previous options were either string wires everywhere, which was not ideal, or rely on Wi-Fi, where you have no control over the radio spectrum and it's a best-efforts service with a shared spectrum. So this is a breakthrough for organizations that they need mission-critical distributed connectivity. Network slicing on 5G is a breakthrough solution for that. We're going to see lots of applications like powering the commercial operations at F1, where it's the perfect solution.\n\nTimothy Horan\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nSo Mike, do you think there's a way that the industry can grow ARPA faster? I mean, we've been kind of growing way, way below inflation for a long period of time, but we're seeing major improvements in the network. I mean, is there any way to kind of get to inflation-type ARPA growth longer term?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nI mean, this industry gives remarkable value. We've been talking about that a little bit during the call. As it relates to T-Mobile, we're always looking for ways that we can serve customers better and make sure that we build a profitable business around that. We have to do that smartly so that we defend and extend our fame as the value provider because that's so important.\nWe have lower costs, so that should be defensible over the long haul, as evidenced by things like a lower debt structure and lower cost to service that debt than anybody else in the industry. It's a defensible place, but we have to defend it by making smart decisions. We have the best network, and that should allow us to find the right optimizations to be able to serve customers better.\nWe can't give you predictions over the long haul other than to say that in 2024, we see opportunities, and that's why we've got a confident guide in 2% year-over-year gain in ARPA. Over the long haul, we'll see what happens. I will tell you that I'm pleased that customers are getting such incredible value from this category. That certainly does open up opportunities for us to make sure for T-Mobile that if there are opportunities for us to monetize that in smart ways that will be appreciated by customers, we'll find ways to do that. Thank you. All right. I think we got time for one final question, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThat question comes from Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nDirector and Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question is just on the industry as a whole. It's the third carrier to report this week and showing some strength here. In your postpaid adds guidance, I'm just curious, to what degree do you expect the industry to soften up in 2024? Is it sort of the same levels of softening you saw in 2023? Second question is just on capital allocation.\nI'm just curious, how sacrosanct is your buyback? If I think about, say, fiber M&A materializing and you're thinking rates could potentially come down over time, would you consider cutting the buyback for M&A? Or again, is it sacrosanct and you consider levering up and keeping the buyback? Just curious to hear your thoughts. Thank you.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. All right. In the context of the guide for the industry as a whole, we do expect some moderation year-over-year. Probably a little bit more moderation in our expectation than what you saw in 2022 to 2023. But look, we look at it from a number of scenarios and kind of give a range. And our job is to, within whatever happens in there, to continue to be the share-taking leader. And when we see accretive opportunities to go above and beyond, much like we did in Q4 and all of 2023, we'll deliver on those. So that's kind of what we look to and work within. In terms of capital, I mean, we talk about fiber and all of that.\nIf you recall, what we said is we thought it was the right time and a prudent thing to do in the rate environment and what we saw to delever a little bit more rapidly to the two-and-a-half point by the end of 2024. We're there at the end of 2023, but there are some puts and takes in terms of timing of payments, for example, with respect to Columbia Capital. But it was the right thing to do there. But even within that, which allowed that envelope that we've announced of share buybacks and dividends, there was some room for investment. And so we'll look within there. But the capital allocation methodology that we look at is the same it's always been and will continue to be.\nWhat are the highest value-creating opportunities that we can see as a management team investing in the network, investing in growth of the core business, the adjacent businesses? And then, of course, we'll look at all other things beyond that, whether that's in the fiber space, whether that's the UScellular. We'd look at that process and see, are there value-creating opportunities? That would be the right thing to do and invest in. But we have a little bit of wiggle room in there in terms of an envelope for investment, even within the guide that we gave you.\nAnd if it's further comfort, I will tell you, obviously, we're going to be guided by what creates value, and there are no absolutes there. But I will tell you, we're not pursuing, to the premise of the example in your question, we're not pursuing a big on-balance sheet transaction in this space. There's no big deal on the horizon that we see that would knock us off our pace. And I think that's important calculus. If something presented itself that made a lot of sense for shareholders, our job is to bring it to you. But right now, we don't see it.\n\nGreg Williams\n\nDirector and Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou bet.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, Greg. That's all the time we have today. Really appreciate everybody joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to either the investor relations or media relations departments. With that, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Q4 Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for TSU Mobile. Please go ahead.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nAll right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.\nOur earnings release, investor back book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website.\nWith that said, let me kick it over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. [ Inching ] on our webcast, you can see we're coming to you from New York City. And I'm here with several members of my senior leadership team, and we're looking forward to discussing another quarter of great results.\nOur strategy to deliver the best network, coupled with the best value and the best customer experience has remained remarkably consistent. And our Q3 results again show how well that strategy is working with another quarter of industry-leading customer and financial growth.\nI want to thank our amazing team nationwide. We have tackled a lot of change together recently to position our company for success in the future, and it hasn't all been easy. But this team showed once again what loving customers looks like and how that simple philosophy translates into success.\nI'm sure you've seen the numbers already. So I'm going to spare you the greatest hits album of all the quarterly results and just [indiscernible] with a few comments so that we can [indiscernible]. First, as we announced yesterday, I am so proud of our network team for reaching our audacious goal of 300 million people covered with dedicated mid-band 5G over 2 months ahead of our year-end target. We announced this goal nearly 3 years ago. And then we got to work and got it done. And to this day, no one else in our industry has stated any plans to match it at any time in the future.\nI know it may get confusing with others celebrating their C-band deployments, which might have the casual observer believe our network lead could be narrowing. But the opposite is true. In fact, even after their C-band deployments, according to Ookla, T-Mobile's nationwide median speeds were double the next competitor speeds in September, double in September. And our mid-band 5G square mile coverage is also double the next close competitor, meaning others still have a lot of wood to chop beyond just population dense pockets to ever reach the expansive geography where T-Mobile is today.\nAnd we have more spectrum dedicated to 5G than anyone else before we've even begun to deploy our C-band, our 3.45 gigahertz spectrum or Auction 108, 2.5 Ghz licenses, let alone refarming our AWS. Listen, we started the 5G era 2 years ahead of the competition and today, we remain 2 or more years ahead. And I predict that 2 years from now, we still will be.\nWhat this all translates to is a superior customer experience. We're rapidly putting [ our spectrum ] resource to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses and we're doing it with the best capital efficiency in the industry. The most exciting part, many prospective customers are only just beginning to take notice that T-Mobile is the overall network lever leaving lots of growth runway ahead.\nAnd we're also expanding on our long held fame for delivering the best value. Our latest Un-carrier move is freeing customers locked into 3-year contracts, and our new Go5G rate plans are delivering the most feature-rich options in wireless. Phone Freedom has turned out to be one of our most exciting Un-carrier moves ever, and it continues to bring high-quality switchers to T-Mobile, as you could see in our industry-leading postpaid account growth.\nWe're also executing on our ARPA revenue growth strategy, posting another strong quarter, well over plus 1% versus a year ago. And revenue per account on the strength of Go5G Plus and multiple products.\nSome have asked, if our new higher-value rate plans are our most popular with consumers, then why isn't ARPU growing faster, too? And I'll point out that consumer ARPU does continue to grow even after offsets growing segments like 55-plus in military. And consumer overall is being partially offset by profitable growth in the enterprise space at somewhat lower ARPUs but attractive CLVs, a development that's contributing well to our financial growth.\nAnd we're doing all of this within a backdrop of a wireless industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows, while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. In fact, this [ industry ] produces cash flow and EBITDA much higher than 5 years ago while, at the same time, customers are enjoying 3x more data at 4x higher speeds while paying just a fraction of the price per unit consumed versus before. And that's before factoring in the expanded device promotions now routinely offered.\nA vibrant, profitable business, delivering rapidly improving network service and value. That's the win-win 5G dividend nobody's talking about. And it helps to showcase why T-Mobile's 5G leadership is so important. This is certainly true in T-Mobile for Business where we had the highest ever account net adds overall and our highest-ever postpaid nets in enterprise based on the strength of our 5G-enabled solutions.\nConsumers are also choosing T-Mobile above all others. Prime network seekers in the top 100 markets increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. And for the first time ever, T-Mobile also won the highest share of switchers in smaller markets and rural areas in Q3.\nBroadband also had another strong quarter. We now serve over 4.2 million customers who are enjoying a great experience with Net Promoter Scores that remain more than 30 points higher than cable, with churn improving year-over-year as well. We remain very much on pace for our longer-term goals with 5G broadband.\nOverall, our customer growth strategy remains differentiated and durable resulting in industry-leading service revenue growth, both at the total company level and at the postpaid service revenue level where most of the value is created, which grew more than 6% or more than 1.5x the growth rate of peers.\nThat top line leadership, coupled with our synergy realization and focus on cost efficiencies, drove double-digit growth in core adjusted EBITDA with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry. This allows us to not only raise our guidance for this year, again, it also gives us excitement and confidence in the future.\nWith our significant growth opportunities continuing to scale with lots of room to run, it sets us up for sustained leadership in both customer and service revenue growth as we look ahead.\nAnd we see opportunities amid the rapidly changing technology landscape as well, all across our business to drive further revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow growth that will allow us to fund our growth investments in our customers and network as well as provide the potential for substantial ongoing shareholder returns.\nThis amazing customer loving team continues to perform beautifully with so much exciting potential ahead, showing why it's not just a tagline. When we say that for customers, employees and investors alike, it's better over here at T-Mobile.\nOkay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. Our ongoing delivery of best-in-class customer and financial growth quarter after quarter enables us to increase our guidance once again. So let's jump into the details.\nWe now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.7 million and 5.9 million, up 50,000 at the midpoint. This reflects continued progress across all our core growth initiatives, partially offset by the deactivation of lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector, the largest of which arose during Q3.\nAs you know, our ability to uniquely solve customer pain points led significant connection growth in the educational sector during the pandemic, supporting the rapid need for remote learning solutions. As things are increasingly returning to normal, we had anticipated many of these connections to roll off in 2023 and do not expect the deactivation of these educational connections to have any material impact to service revenue looking forward.\nIncluded in the 5.7 million to 5.9 million is our expectation of approximately 3 million postpaid phone net additions for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher postpaid phone net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $29 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up over 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, fueled by higher service revenues and synergies and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end.\nOur merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024.\nNow with the merger integration now substantially behind us, we will discontinue reporting synergies separately from overall business results going forward. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger-related costs of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to date.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, are now expected to be in the range of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, delivering our network milestones ahead of schedule at a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry.\nThe higher operating cash flows not only fund the increased CapEx, but also allow for a slight increase to free cash flow now expected to be between $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. Not only is this up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, but also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. Consistent with the entire year -- related free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nTurning to income taxes. We continue -- our full year active tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than 1% as we continue to expand our account relationships as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue.\nIn closing, our differentiated and profitable growth strategy continues to deliver industry leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow along with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry to unlock shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nAll right, let's get to your questions.

Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line by pressing one, followed by four, and via Twitter by sending a tweet to T-MobileIR or ike sievert using TMUS. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, SVP and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nWelcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.\nOur earnings release, investor factbook, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the quarterly results section of the investor relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Okay, thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nAs you can see, we're here with several members of our senior management team. We're coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington, and we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me share just a few comments. If you'll recall, at our analyst day in early 2021, we shared our strategy to build the best network, couple it with a leading Un-carrier value proposition and customer experience, and grow our share in areas where T-Mobile was massively underpenetrated relative to our peers. That strategy and our approach has remained remarkably consistent and our Q2 results continue to show that it's working better than ever.\nIn fact, T-Mobile delivered our highest Q2 postpaid phone net adds in eight years, fueled by both industry-leading gross adds and the lowest postpaid phone churn in company history. Importantly, we did this while industry growth normalized, proving that the growth opportunities and durable advantages we've been sharing with you really are unique to T-Mobile. We also told you that if we delivered the best product, the best value, and the best experiences, there was no reason we couldn't get to the lowest churn in the industry. Remember that?\nIn Q2 we did it. For the first time in our history, T-Mobile reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry. That is a remarkable statement, and it's a testament to the work our team has done to build the best network and to further our value proposition to deliver even better experiences to customers. Now, I'm sure there's still going to be some back and forth between us and the other guys before we consistently put them in the rearview mirror for good on churn, but all the same, it is great to get this first win.\nWe also continue to run the business in a smart and sustainable manner, translating our industry-leading customer growth in Q2 into industry-leading service revenue growth, and Core Adjusted EBITDA growth while growing Free Cash Flow by more than 60% year-over-year.\nThis industry-leading customer and financial growth led us to raise guidance for the year again, and we're fortunate to deliver these industry-leading results within the context of a vibrant wireless industry with growing industry service revenues, industry cash flows, and healthy competition that continues to deliver more value and better networks to customers. In fact, on network we not only defended but extended our leadership in both overall and 5G performance with the latest three third-party reports showing that T-Mobile's lead is widening.\nLooking at Ookla data, T-Mobile once again swept every category for overall network performance with median download speeds more than double our closest competitor. We've long talked about how our dedicated 5G spectrum assets with superior propagation would result in a demonstrable advantage in customers everyday lived experiences and even as the competitors try to catch us T-Mobile's head start.\nOur dedicated 5G spectrum assets and our technology leadership are the things that allow us to stay meaningfully ahead, as in, like, two years or more ahead in 5G reach and overall network performance, and to stay ahead for years to come. The most exciting part is that many prospective customers are only just beginning to notice, which means more, lots of the benefit from this is in front of us, and importantly, these things also allow it to do it all with the best capital efficiency in the industry.\nNow we also continue to build on our fame for providing the best value. Our latest Un-carrier move, Phone Freedom, frees customers locked up into those three-year contracts at the carriers, and our new Go5G rate plan delivers the best value in wireless. The response from customers has been really amazing.\nIn fact, Go5G instantly became our most popular plan, and we're seeing improved porting ratios against every competitor, including yet another quarter of year-over-year improvement against cable. In fact, total postpaid porting ratios for us have improved every month since we launched Phone Freedom, including in July, as more and more customers learn that they can break free from those three-year contracts, come to a better network, and get a better value.\nAt T-Mobile, all of these catalysts, coupled with our unique growth opportunities in underpenetrated markets, are what enable a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition. You're seeing it again in these Q2 results. We added 299,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest reported in the industry, showing that we continue to win the switching decisions in the market.\nAnd we had postpaid net additions of 1.6 million, again leading the industry by a wide margin. This included postpaid phone net adds of 760,000, our highest Q2 in eight years. Even as the industry sees more normalized levels of growth. Our increased share was driven by our industry-best phone gross adds, which grew over last year's Q2, as well as the lowest postpaid phone churn in our history, and, as I mentioned, the lowest in the industry for the first time ever at just 0.77%. In T-Mobile for Business, we had a record quarter with best-ever phone net adds and our lowest-ever phone churn.\nEnterprise and government customers buy based on their own rigorous testing of the networks, not just price, and our network leadership, innovative solutions, and customer experiences are driving major wins and fueling our momentum in these segments. We're attracting profitable customers with CLVs in the hundreds of dollars each and still growing. As I mentioned, consumers are beginning to take notice of our network strides, as well as we're winning prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs.\nWe saw our share of switchers in the top 100 markets increase both sequentially and year-over-year. In smaller markets in rural areas where we continue to bring the first and, in many places, only 5G network, we're seeing an incredible response. We're capturing a win share of switchers in these areas in the upper 30s, which shows we're not only on track to meet our goal of 20% share in 2025, but it gives us confidence we have room to run in the years beyond.\nIn addition to mobile wireless, we added 509,000 High-Speed Internet Customers. Notably, we've continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched over two years ago as demand for the product just continues to grow. We saw sequential improvement in churn again this quarter, and net promoter scores that remain multiples higher than cable, demonstrating how our High-Speed Internet resonates with and satisfies an important target audience within this larger broadband market.\nWe also celebrated another major milestone in our Sprint merger integration as we are now substantially complete with both the billing migration and retail rationalization well ahead of our year-end target. At every step of our integration journey, the customer has been our primary focus. As you know, this has allowed us to not only unlock synergies bigger and faster than expected, but also to deliver industry-leading growth and record low churn at the same time. I could not be more proud of what our team has accomplished in this area. Okay, I'm going to wrap it up.\nWe are pulling into the station halfway 2023 with great momentum. Our postpaid phone net adds year to date are right on track with last year, which was a growth record year for us. We continue to extend our durable network and value leadership over the competition, which fuels our growth opportunities. Our profitable growth strategy continues to translate into the highest Core Adjusted EBITDA growth and year-to-date cash flow conversion in the industry.\nListen, in our industry change is a constant, but our team navigates it deftly with the customer as our North Star. Because of that there has never been a more exciting time to be at T-Mobile. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance for 2023.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks Mike. Hey, Q2 was another quarter of best in class profitable growth which underpins the updated guidance that I'll share with you in a moment. It starts with the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 5% year-over-year, driven by continued increases in both postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA.\nOur disciplined focus on profitability resulted in an 11% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA, and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points year-over-year. In addition, free cash flow was up 64% year-over-year, and with the highest free cash flow to service revenue margin relative to our peers year to date. We expect this to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward.\nThis strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 25.2 million shares for $3.5 billion in Q2 with a cumulative total of 83.5 million shares repurchased for $11.8 billion as of 21 July. All right, let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.6 and 5.9 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities, and we continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year.\nOur focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our Core Adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $28.9 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2020, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our analyst day a year ahead of schedule.\nAs we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024, we continue to expect merger-related costs which are not included in adjusted or Core Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes and we now expect cash merger-related costs of $1.6 to 2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to date.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $18 to 18.3 billion, and we now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.5 and 9.7 billion, delivering a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry unlocked by our network leadership. We expect CapEx to taper in Q3 and then fall further in Q4. The slightly higher operating cash flows fund the increased CapEx, resulting in strong free cash flow of $13.2 to 13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs.\nThis is up approximately 75% over last year thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers.\nWith further expansion expected next year, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. Finally, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than the 1% we had previously guided for 2023 as we continue to expand our account relationships across products and services as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. Before I wrap up, I want to remind folks that we closed the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent on 1 May, which had a partial impact on our results in Q2 and we expect the full run rate impact beginning in Q3 as I laid out last quarter.\nIn closing, we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities to deliver the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry and unlock shareholder value. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud, all right.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nLet's get to your questions. You can ask a question via phone by pressing 1 followed by 4 and via Twitter by sending a tweet to MobileIR or mikesievert using TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone, operator. First question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Thank you. That will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, Nick, for the question, and it was great to see the strong cash flow in the quarter. In light of that, we've gotten a few questions around why you decided to downtick a little bit on the buyback.\nI guess maybe the higher level.\nQuestion we're getting now that you're much further into the program, how do you think about managing that program going forward? Cash flow is obviously an input. You're going to be making some payments for C-Band spectrum this year. So what's the right way for investors to kind of frame their expectations around how you're going to manage that on a go forward basis? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, sounds great. Thanks Brett. I'll start and then maybe hand it to Peter for some comments. You know the way I think about it is we're buying at a pace through mostly pre-designed 10 B51 programs in order to be able to meet the authorization during the time frame of the authorization. So if you recall, the initial authorization of this program is a $14 billion program that takes us through September. And if you look at some of our activity early in the year where we were able to grab some additional run rate, now the remaining funds relative to the remaining time suggests a run rate where we have it.\nSo it's not really a downtick so much as just kind of a programmatic view. And then maybe Peter can pile in on the second part. The way we think about it broadly is that there's essentially been no underlying change to the thesis we've been communicating all along. Now, our board hasn't made a determination yet about the second step, but the inputs to those steps have to do with the free cash flow development of this company, which as you mentioned in the premise of your question, is right on track. We're guiding to 75% year-over-year cash flow growth this year.\nAnd you know, the underpinnings of the growth in the business, as you saw from our fantastic Q2 momentum, suggest another good year in 2024. And so as the cash flow develops, you know, that's what gives us the confidence that that original thesis of around $60 billion through 2025 is intact. But maybe you can also comment, Peter, on kind of how we think about this from a dedication of resources to this versus Spectrum and other things.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nAbsolutely. Brett. Yeah, one of the things that we had underpinned at Analyst Day is that it's, you know, about up to $65 billion of free cash flow that's going to support this $60 billion of potential shareholder remuneration. And within that we had some room and had reserved some capacity for spectrum purchases and other things. And of course we'll fundamentally continue throughout this whole period one to deliver because the underlying delivery of the free cash flow is what allows everything to happen.\nAnd of course always look at opportunities before us for the highest value creation opportunity. With your question on C-band, that was already included in our assumption here. So when we continue to say we have optimism around the program in totality, C-band is fully contemplated within that.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's great, caller, if I can ask. A quick follow-up question, since we're. Talking about overall liquidity, any update on the spectrum option that Dish holds and if that were to get exercised, how do you think about putting that proceeds to work? Thanks.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nSure. Well, the first thing I would point out is that any proceeds from that have not been contemplated in the long range cash planning. So if there's cash that comes from that soon, that'd be incremental to the planning expectations. We're still awaiting Dish's decision. So just as an update, and I think our filings made some of this clear, the deadline has come and gone for them to determine whether or not they would exercise their privilege to buy that spectrum for $3.6 billion. But they asked for some additional time of the DOJ, and we did not object to that.\nAnd so we have committed that we would not terminate their agreement and right to do that at any time before 11 August. But in fact, we're in discussions with Dish about whether or not there might be a win-win that's different from their initial privilege. And if there is, you know, that would be wonderful. But obviously, you know that deadline is coming, so. But you know, our view was it was worth taking the extra time, especially since they asked for in case there's a bigger win-win to be had here.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Appreciate it.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nThank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffittNathanson. Your line is open.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. Two questions. One, as long as we're on the topic of Dish, outside of the 800, if the opportunity came up, would you have an appetite for more mid-band spectrum either from Dish or perhaps any other source, and we're talking about sort of meaningful size chunks here. Then second, if you could just talk about the pacing and trajectory of fixed wireless as you now with a little more experience under your belts, as you look out toward your long-term guidance. How do you think about the pacing to get to 8 million or so households?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSounds great. Well, I'll tackle the first one and then maybe hand to Mike Katz for the second one. You know, and I don't mean to be flipped, Craig, but I think you've been following us for so long, you know, we've never met spectrum we didn't like. And so of course, but one thing that distinguishes us from other providers is that when we get our hands on spectrum, we put it to work, you know, right away for the benefit of the American consumer. And so that's not only in the public interest, but that's in the interest of T-Mobile and our customers.\nAnd so, you know, you see that in how we're deploying so ambitiously the two and a half gigahertz that are the proceeds of the merger, having built the best 5G network in history on that spectrum acquisition that came through the merger.\nSo, look, I mean, we're always on the hunt for, are there ways to add capacity to our network because it allows us to do amazing things like not only continue to take share, grow, and meet ever-rising needs of customers on their smartphones, but also to get after the subject of your second question, which is fixed wireless access, and you know, to the first part of your second question, nothing has changed in our aspiration. We're still on the hunt for that single-digit penetration. And maybe Mike could comment about what we're seeing in the marketplace and the rate and pace of our growth versus our expectations.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing Strategies, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, thanks Mike. Thanks, Greg, for the question. You know, we couldn't be happier with what's going on with this HSI business. You probably saw from all of our results. We just crossed over 3.7 million customers in this business. This pacing that we're on, which we told you last quarter and the. Quarter before of right around where we. We're in Q2, right around 500,000 customers, gives us confidence that the 7 to 8 million total customers that we committed to at the end of this planning period, that we've got high confidence that. We're going to get there.\nOne of the things that Mike mentioned, his comments that I think is worth reiterating, is we saw in Q2 again our highest gross adds, and our gross adds have increased every single quarter since. We launched this product. Then again in Q2 we saw sequential decreases in churn. I think that really speaks to. The fact that this is a great product. It's a great product that customers are really, really loving. And you see that both in this sequential churn decrease, but also just in the overall NPS scores, which continue to be the highest among any broadband category in America.\nSo we're really thrilled with where we are with this product. Back to my comments up front. I said things have been remarkably consistent with what we rolled out to you at our Analyst Day in 2021. This is one of those things. You know, we said we saw a potential here of seven to eight million subscribers based on the excess capacity profile of our T-Mobile network. That means it's not capital-burdened and because of that we can make profit there. And so it plays a role; it's a single-digit penetration role. And we're on our way to going and seizing it for the benefit of our shareholders and our customers. And it's right on track.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nResearch Analyst, New Street Research\n\nThank you very much. Wonder if you can give us context on a couple of things. So firstly, how are you thinking about the evolution of upgrades in the second half of the year as we go through a new iPhone cycle, and kind of what have you factored into your guidance on.\nEBITDA for that? It looks like upgrades to the industry have been coming in sort of lower than expected, much lower than historical trends. I'm wondering how that shifts in the second half of the year, and then wondering if you can give us a little bit more context on fixed wireless broadband. Churn, you mentioned that it come down sequentially, which isn't surprising in that it's always low in the broadband market in Q2. But what does it look like on a year-over-year basis? Maybe you can give us some context around the kind of levels that it's at for the mature portion of the base that's been with you maybe for.\nA year or more, maybe three year or more.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, Jonathan, you're spot on in the premise of the question that looking at the aging of the base is the way to get at it. We'll come to Mike on that in a minute. But first on upgrades, historically low upgrades. Peter, what's contemplated for the rest of the year and maybe a little commentary on why do we think we're seeing that?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, well, let me start with why do we think we're seeing that? Fundamentally, we believe we're meeting customers' needs and desires. And if you look at what we're seeing talked about from a network perspective and a value perspective, it makes a lot of sense. You come onto this network and you have a 5G device. Remember, about 2/3 of our postpaid base already has a 5G device. And they get experience on this network that is just phenomenal in the broadest sense of the word, much more than the competitive sense can bring. And we think we're just meeting their natural demand.\nCustomers are happy with their devices; they're happy with their devices. From a longer perspective, remember we continue to have two-year financing constructs so they have the ability to upgrade earlier than the competition. One of the unlocks of Phone Freedom that we put out there that led to the port ratio changes. Fundamentally, we think we're exactly meeting what customers need in regards to the second half. The second half always tends to have slightly higher upgrade rates. You mentioned that you have a new product introduction from Apple. You tend to have promotional constructs and a little bit higher switching in the second half.\nWe're typically the beneficiary of that. We also obviously make very, very solid offers to our base from an upgrade perspective. We do have higher upgrade rates contemplated than what we saw in Q2, but we don't specifically guide to those other than directionally.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay. Mike, over to you on a little bit more color on High-Speed Internet churn.\n\nMike Katz\n\nPresident of Marketing Strategies, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, I mean, I think building on what you're saying, Mike, you know what? We have the youngest base of broadband customers in America. And like I think we said in a couple calls, the churn curves that we see for customers like in our mobile business tends to be higher in the earlier tenure months and then reduces as customers achieve greater, greater tenure lengths with us. And we're seeing the exact same thing. In our broadband business.\nCustomers that have been with us for some months. Their churn has decreased to the point that was right where we expected it. It's looking right on where our plan was, and the behavior has been just right in line with what we expected.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, terrific. And maybe Jud, tell us when it's time to go to Twitter so that we're not ignoring the people coming in on Twitter because we always do some of that as well. But while you're thinking about it, we'll operator to one more online.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks guys. Two questions if I could. First on margins, obviously a lot of progress there, 300 basis points, but you guys still trail AT&T and Verizon by about 500 basis points. Do you see that closing over time or is it really just a function of those sort of lower ARPU and faster sub growth? That's number one. Number two, Mike, I think you said that your porting versus cable has improved, and I don't think you've called that out before, but maybe just some commentary about what you're seeing in terms of competition in wireless and cable. I mean they're talking about sort of more and more bundled offerings, and I guess Comcast was sort of flattish on.\nA year-over-year basis. But just what the posture is there and what's driving that improvement? Importing from cable. Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, I'll take that one. But Peter, we'll start with you.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. Certainly on the margin question, you know, it's a lot more than an ARPU differential. It's really some structural differences that we always call out, for example, the whole leased versus owned, the backhaul strategy. The other thing to always note is that with this significant higher switching that we see in the net add production that we're giving, obviously we have more SG&A than the competition does. We have a very dense network built out. So there's fundamentally some structural differences that also mean there's a CapEx OpEx differential.\nAnd when you compare AT&T, Verizon, and us, and that's why it's always important to fundamentally look at conversion of service revenue into free cash flow. Free cash flow is the value generation engine that allows you to further invest, return capital to shareholders, or do all sorts of other things to create value.\nThat is the measure by which we're really comparing ourselves to the competition to get rid of all the structural noise. On that regard, you heard what we announced today already there from a year-to-date basis in terms of beating them on the conversion ratio with next year anticipated to expand that ratio further. That's how I think about margins.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nIt's interesting that when you listen to Peter and you hear that even with our superior growth and our lower prices, both of which hit margins, we have the superior cash production per service revenue dollar in the industry year to date. And that's rapidly expanding 75% year-over-year guide this year on our way to higher cash flows next year. And so it really shows you the power of this model based on this team's ability to execute, but also based on the balance sheet, the incredible assets that we control, the track record of execution, the head start, and many other benefits.\nOkay, great. The second one was. Oh, second one was cable. So John, let me come back to that. Yeah, we did make a very light comment on it, but it was light that we had been seeing improvements in our port ratios with cable last quarter because we wanted to provide some commentary because cable in Q4 started to see some pretty big net add trajectory changes. And so we kind of double clicked into that because you kind of have to do that as a competitor to figure out, you know, is this going to come from us or what's going on. And it's kind of interesting.\nYou fast forward to this quarter and I'll remind you that even in a world where cable is now a pretty big share taker in overall postpaid, T-Mobile produced the highest postpaid phone net additions for a Q2 in eight years. And not only the lowest churn ever in our history, but the lowest in the industry.\nThat kind of answers a question as to whether or not, you know, this dynamic from cable is coming from our side. Right? I mean, you know, we're performing better than before. They were in the industry, but obviously there's a dynamic that affects others. Both of our two lookalike components, competitors, plus prepaid. You know, there's a lot of brands that have been affected by this and they're viable competitors to be taken seriously. But it's just, as you can see in our performance, not affecting our results.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, Jud, what do we have coming in online?\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nWe've got a question from Rod Drettner. On how strong was the business growth this quarter? Maybe we can tee that one up and then got a follow on question around. Enterprise sector as well, so we can hit those. Okay, great. So Roger Entner asked, how strong was business growth this quarter? Can you talk about the VA and any additional color on overall business growth? We also have.\nChetan Sharma coming in. Congrats on another great quarter. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some comments on traction you're seeing in the enterprise sector beyond connectivity. What about vertical industries, people using 5G, 5G advanced services, et cetera. So maybe Callie, why don't you start on both of those and anybody else can jump in.\n\nCallie Field\n\nPresident of T-Mobile for Business Group, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, thanks, Mike. Thanks, Roger, and Chetan for the questions. As Mike mentioned earlier, we delivered on our highest phone net adds and lowest phone churn ever, handily beating Verizon again. We're seeing profitable growth in all three segments. In S and B, we achieved positive port trends against AT&T, and this makes five consecutive quarters against Verizon. We grew ARPU quarter over quarter again. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, in enterprise and in government, our business is good business with very profitable CLVs, roughly 60% to 70% relative to consumer, and they're rising year-over-year, quarter over quarter.\nIn Q2 for Enterprise, for instance, we welcomed both the largest global asset management firm and yet another leading global bank as new accounts. We also landed two huge government contracts with the EPA and the IRS, and continue to double our net adds quarter over quarter with first responders, most significantly in rural areas where an older LTE network just doesn't cut it for critical response. A lot of really good growth this quarter from an incredible team in the business group.\nFor the VA question, if I could just take that one for a second, I wanted to say, as you may remember, we took Verizon share back in 2018, and now because of our network, we've taken the pole position and have added roughly 20,000 phones year to date, supporting more than 50% of the VA phones today. I'll note too, our contract also includes T-Mobile's 5G Internet for the VA's community-based outpatient clinics.\nWe're able to provide health care for veterans in rural areas because of the network that we have built. I just wanted to add some clarity on the VA subject. One last thing on use cases for 5G applications outside of pure connectivity. I'll start chatting with some of the verticals where we're seeing the most traction, and that would be in retail, where we see many use cases for fixed 5G solutions. People are looking to look at better costs, less truck rolls, and support for perhaps older wireline services, and are replacing that with T-Mobile's 5G in multi-unit national retailers.\nIn healthcare, this is another area where we're seeing CTOs and CIOs from large hospitals come to us and say, look, we need ubiquitous connectivity, both indoor and outdoor. We need more of a programmable network. We need certain places in our buildings where we want to designate private networks. Because of our public 5G network and the solutions that we can offer with our standalone core, we're able to offer a hybrid solution that's really working in a place like a hospital that has lots of different variation to the types of connectivity they need.\nLastly, I'll say we're seeing some traction in education, large campuses that want to provide connectivity for their students, but also ways to use their data differently, and to get in all of the dorms, places in the campus, rooms, libraries, and perhaps older buildings where there's really a need for ubiquitous coverage throughout the campus. Those are the three areas that really pop out to me.\nThe last one I would say is in the federal use cases with the Department of Defense, where, not a surprise to anyone, lots of areas for us to begin to deploy hybrid networks and private networks for use cases specific to the military.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, hopefully that answers it and more. I mean, if you listen to Callie, it just reinforces what I said in my upfront remarks, which is some of the biggest, most sophisticated, and profitable customers are choosing T-Mobile because of the sophistication of our advanced network capabilities and our ability to translate that into solutions for their business. That's just so different from where we were a few years ago. It's a complete 180, and it's fueling momentum. In fact, all-time record results in our business group. Hopefully that answers the question, guys.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nTerrific. Should we go back to the phones? Let's do it. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nHey Phil.\n\nPhil Cusik\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi guys. Thank you. I'm Phil. You know, the wireless industry is still running maybe hotter than many expected at the beginning of the year. Certainly, your momentum is strong. Are you seeing improving porting ratios versus?Other MNOs and maybe the MVNOs? Do you think there's a growing mix of customers who are coming in without a phone history or number? Second, if I can, CapEx. Mike, you talked about tapering in the second half. Does that jumping off rate in the fourth quarter indicate a much lower 2024 CapEx level? Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great. I'm going to let Peter answer the second CapEx question. The first one's really interesting. The answer to the question is yes and yes, both are true. Yes, our port ratios are improving each and every month since we launched Phone Freedom against each and every competitor, including cable overall, and cable individually. That's a really interesting fact that it shows that not only are people starting to discover our network advantages, which has sort of been a slow improvement over the last year and a half, but we have really sparked intrigue with consumers around this idea.\nWe can free them from being trapped with the other guys. You know, cable in some ways actually is helpful in that, in a dynamic competitive industry, more people are jump balls, and more people are saying, should I be with one of those two look-alike kind of old line providers, or should I be with somebody new? When they get asked that question, they aren't picking cable by and large, they're picking T-Mobile. As you saw, we had the industry-leading postpaid phone net additions. What is happening is cable is growing very rapidly and faster than I think a lot of people expected.\nSpecifically to your premise of your question, our port ratios with cable have been improving year-over-year for nine quarters in a row. What you see is that the big step forward they started to take in Q4, according to our analysis, about 80% of the year-over-year increment in their performance from the same periods a year ago, Q4, Q1, and Q2, is from non-ports. They're actually not growing the porting side of their business at the same rate as the not porting side of their business, instead kind of printing postpaid ads. They might be coming over from prepaid, they might be just simply net new, they might be kind of dropped in the bag.\nI don't really know. There's probably several different factors to it, and we just, we don't know quite how to unpack it because we don't have all the information. I mean, we double click into things like Verizon's wholesale revenue and note that it's not growing. That's sort of an interesting diagnostic for us that helps us understand, you know, what might be happening. Anyway, hopefully that helps it. Our industry-leading account growth of 299,000 shows that T-Mobile is winning the switching decisions in, you know, high-quality, prime paying families, the kind everybody's going for.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah. On CapEx, Phil, the way I think about next year, although we're not specifically, specifically guiding, is we're still comfortable in the $9 to 10 billion range that we gave out. Remember, I wouldn't take Q4 as a jumping off point because really the way Ulf and team have built this is a very lean manufacturing approach to the build, one of the secrets to our capital efficiency there. It isn't that I take a run rate and an exit run rate and project it, but $9 to 10 billion feels about right for next year at this point in time.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nSpeaking of a lean network performance machine, I think it would be a good time to just stop and take note of what's been delivered with this incredibly capital efficient profile that you're asking about. You know, Olson team, you guys deserve incredible credit. We've now reached 285 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G. This is something that neither of our principal competitors have promised to ever do, certainly not in the next two years.\nWe've been talking about this idea of being, you know, two or more years ahead in the 5G race, but if anything, it's expanding. Maybe you could share a few of the statistics of kind of where we are and also a little shadowing of where we're going.\n\nUlf Ewaldsson\n\nPresident of Technology, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, thanks, Mike. Yeah, the last quarter we actually pulled ahead in our leadership, and 285 million mid-band POPs, we're heading towards 300 million by the end of this year. We have to remember that we reached 200 million mid-band POPs two years ago in 2021. On our low band, we reached 300 million two years ago. Where others are now pulling into the station, it gets harder and harder by the POPs as you grow through. Every 100 million POPs takes about three times the effort in terms of upgrading and building new towers to be able to deliver the same POP growth.\nThis network is just fantastic, and we are so proud of it. We're proud to support also what Callie commented on earlier, 5G being capable of not only being that tremendous consumer driver, it also drives now more and more of the business inside the enterprise space, which is a dream for all of us who have followed 5G for many, many years. On top of that, we have lots of room to move ahead. We have today 255MHz of spectrum that is dedicated to 5G on our mid-band, and you have to remember that our low-band is all dedicated to 5G.\nWhen others are talking about their coverage, they're sharing this between LTE and 5G, and we're not, we're dedicating spectrum. The mid-band megahertz will grow to 200 megahertz dedicated to 5G by the end of the year by migrating more LTE spectrum over to 5G. We haven't even started on what we can use for 2024 and beyond, which is our C-Band.\nWe can use our 345 Auction results, we can use our 108 Auction results, which is enhancing our 2.5 capabilities even more. We have yet to re-farm spectrum, for example, on AWS as well. There is just so much more for us to run at. I couldn't be more excited that we're extending our lead in terms of our network.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, it's a good thing you are because we're filling it up. You know what's interesting is that with 3.7 million High- Speed Internet Customers and rapidly growing, the average speeds on our network are not just twice as fast as our competitors, but growing. We're speeding up, not slowing down on this network in terms of the average person's lived experience, and that's just phenomenal. We've got tons of capacity that we have not yet rolled out, which opens up more and more opportunity on our way to not only the 7 to 8 million High-Speed Internet Customers, but our ability to, with the best network, continue to take share from our competitors.\nWe said at the beginning we had a two plus year advantage and we would have it for the duration of the 5G era. You're proving us right with that work, so thank you.\n\nPhil Cusik\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, thanks guys.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOperator.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks a lot. Good evening. Just following up if I could on that spectrum deployment. I think in the past you've talked about rolling out fixed wireless to a majority of the US. Perhaps you could just help us understand where you are on coverage today with the base offer, and how that should evolve over time now that you're 285 going to 300. I guess a related question is for Ulf. You didn't mention the millimeter wave. I know you've been looking at potentially a macro overlay product. How are you thinking about that at the moment? Or attacking MDUs with millimeter wave? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell, let's start with the millimeter wave question, and we can come back to the coverage on fixed wireless. I can touch on that one.\n\nUlf Ewaldsson\n\nPresident of Technology, T-Mobile US\n\nRight. We are actually using mmWave today. We have deployments that we early on started off in Manhattan, for example, in Los Angeles. In some areas where we really have that extreme, extraordinary capacity need, we can use the tool of millimeter wave. Our general strategy is not based on millimeter wave. It is based on a macro strategy, which, you know, is our layered approach with our low band, our mid band, and now also deploying our PCS spectrum for 5G.\nMillimeter wave could also be potentially an interesting play for us when it comes to enhancing capacities that could be used, for example, for HSI. We are working with our vendors, and we are working through our OEMs to figure out if we can make a viable economic and technical performance case out of that with them.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThat kind of bridges to your second question. Maybe this is a good time to remind everybody how our capacity model works for fixed wireless access. Essentially, right now we serve about the potential of about 50 million homes, but they're not in certain geographies. They're geographically dispersed all over the US because the way our model works is we're selling excess capacity sector by sector. What we do is study every sector from every tower in our network and determine what amount of normative smartphone usage will there be over the next several years.\nIn areas where there's still excess capacity, we today approve applicants for home Internet use. Right now there's about 50 million home addresses where if you were to go into our tool and apply to be our customer, we'd say yes out of the 145 million in the country. What's interesting is if you and several of your neighbors all did the same, the nth person would get a no, because it's a dynamic model. What we're selling is excess capacity. Our modeling shows us that we will get to, as we said at the very beginning, about 7 or 8 million households with this excess capacity model that's not burdened by capital.\nSince it's not burdened by capital, with an already built mobile network that you need for great coverage and competitiveness, we're able to profitably build this business at very low prices. It's just a win-win for a sort of single-digit penetration part of the market. Now, to the premise of your question and what Ulf was getting into, of course we're studying whether there are ways to go beyond that initiative.\nInitial excess capacity, capital-free model, capital-free-ish model. We haven't drawn any conclusions about that yet. I mean, we're looking hard at millimeter wave, you know, we're looking at whether or not dedicating mid-band spectrum to HSI would make sense, whether there are non-standards-based solutions. We just haven't drawn any conclusions. It's not immediately obvious that there are economic ways to grow this business beyond its initial single-digit penetration. You may see us doing trials in the marketplace as we experiment with this and try to crack the code.\nYou know, you'll hear about us trying millimeter wave things, MDU strategies, or non-standards-based solutions to see if there's a way to get after it. You see us trialing fiber, whether or not there's a way for our team, our distribution, our brand to add value in the fiber ecosystem. I've made mention of that before, all these things are things we're doing to try to learn. The good news is we've got some time because we'll hit this kind of initial terminal sizing of HSI. Still, we've got two more years to run. You know, our heads are down seeing if there's a way to crack the code on this.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US",
    "content2": "Of course, any of the things we do there that we just talked about, a capital burden model or something with fiber, are all things that would have to be accretive to our analyst day guidance that we put out there.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood, thank you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, great, operator. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey, just curious, why wouldn't you be raising fixed wireless prices now? It seems like you have very, very strong demand from everything we hear out there. You kind of have somewhat limited supply, and I guess related to that, the Go5G plan. Can you give us some color what that means for ARPU growth the next couple years? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, let's start with the second one on Go5G and where's ARPU going, and ARPA, and all that stuff. Peter, we can start with you.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, absolutely. I'll let John comment on the success of Go5G, but as I always say, you know, when we think about ARPU and you saw a sequential increase of about $0.20, we continue to believe on a year-to-year basis ARPU will be generally stable.\nThere's probably some potential for sequential increase again from Q2 to Q3, since it is such a mix-driven metric and you have to put everything into it, whether we're talking about all the benefits we see from Go5G, whether we talk about the benefits we see from a segmented approach, whether it's, you know, military, 55+, and how those might be lower ARPU customers than the average that we see, but are high CLV customers coming in, very high-quality customers.\nSimilarly in business, you know, business you tend to get enterprise, government, large accounts that have very, very great CLVs but would have, given the nature of, you know, the volume purchasing, lower ARPU. All of that blends into ARPU that we see as generally stable.\nIt's the ARPA strategy that we have, it's the switching, attracting accounts into T-Mobile, and then the land and expand ARPA strategy, which you just saw, you know, an exciting update to the guide from plus 1% to slightly over 1% on a year-over-year basis there. That's really the focus point for us. You know, the question on Go5G, I think I'd hand it to Ulf for a moment because it's been a phenomenal success.\n\nUlf Ewaldsson\n\nPresident of Technology, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah.\nI think, Peter, just to remind everybody, the Go5G is really kind of a front book initiative. We're not going into the base and asking people to migrate to Go5G and doing all of that within the base. It's really kind of a front book initiative. This is going fantastic, and we had an opportunity to mention this on our Q1 earnings call back on 27 April 2023 when we launched Phone Freedom, Go5G, Go5G Plus in mid April.\nLike Mike said a few moments ago, when you look at the overall porting ratios and the attractiveness of this offer, and what's happening, we've increased our porting ratios every month against every competitor and have followed that through so far in July. Over 60% of the accounts that are joining T-Mobile are now subscribing to Go5G, and there's utility that's different than Magenta MAX in terms of hotspot data that we've increased, in terms of high-speed roaming in Mexico and Canada, across North America, that we've increased.\nThe big pain point that I think Go5G is solving is that new and 2 promise, first of all, paired with the easy unlock and helping people get out of AT&T and Verizon, mostly AT&T given the unlocked devices, helping people get out of that and switch into T-Mobile.\nThis three year contract cycle that AT&T and Verizon has, we knew this was a big insight and a big opportunity that even I underestimated. How big of a pain point that is. The fact that you can't, you can basically go to law school and complete law school faster than you can complete a phone contract at AT&T and Verizon. That is a huge pain point. The promise of Go5G, of being able to get in a new device, same device offer as a new customer every two years, that's a differentiated and unique proposition in the marketplace that's really different and has really resonated with customers.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nWell said. Okay, your last question was about HSI pricing. I'll just answer it briefly.\nI don't normally give sort of forward-looking commentary on pricing, so I'll answer it this way instead, which is do we see ARPU and are we interested in ARPU enhancement for HSI? The answer is yes, of course. Generally, when you look at our track record, our philosophy in the past as to how to get about that isn't today to jack up people's prices. It's to add value to their life, bring new services, show them increased offers, and let themselves select their way up. You know, obviously we're interested in that in this space.\n\nTim Horan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great. Good. All right, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks and good afternoon. Just following on the earlier comments on some of the integration milestones that you've hit, what are the activities that are left to get to the full synergy run rate of $7.5 billion for this year's guidance, $8 billion next year? Can you unpack and maybe even size some of the opportunities for further?\nCost efficiencies that may be embedded in.\nYour multi-year plan to drive that longer-term margin expansion? Thanks.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nOkay, great. Michael. Well, let's talk about where we are on synergies this year and what's left to be done. I mean on the what's left to be done front, not much. You know, the major milestones are behind us, but that doesn't mean the synergy run rates are quite there yet. Maybe you can comment on that dynamic, Peter.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nCFO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, exactly. A few things in there. Of course, we said we have a small tail of customers to still get over, and that'll allow the final decommissioning of systems and things to that. Whether it's front office or back office, those are the things that are kind of left to do. Certainly from a cost perspective, there's a little bit in terms of physical decom. While the sites are shut off, there's still physical decom happening.\nOn the synergy development, as we get from seven and a half to the $8 billion next year, really the big chunk of that is avoided cost. We'll realize the vast majority of the run rate synergies by the end of this year, which you'd naturally expect given we're saying we're substantially done. The shift to next year will be fundamentally those avoided site build costs.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nCan you share how T-Mobile is looking at. The role and mix of online distribution. How you're viewing the durability of customers wanting a physical retail location to buy and upgrade devices? Location to buy and upgrade devices?\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYeah, absolutely. It kind of goes to the premise of your follow-on question, your initial follow-on question, Michael. I mean, obviously across consumer markets generally, customers want a transaction that's fast, transparent, simple, and mostly digital. Our industry has been very stubborn on that front, mostly due to the complexity of the offers across all the providers. That's something that we're very focused on. I know everybody in the industry is. Our digital capabilities are rapidly improving, especially as it relates to self-service for our customers.\nIt's incredible what's going on left to right in our company as to how we're already applying AI technologies and machine learning to speed things up, serve customers in a better way. We can get into some examples around that. Because of emerging technologies, there's a lot of potential over the coming years to not only meet customers where they are finally in this industry, because we've been kind of slow in this industry due to the complexity of our offers, but also to potentially realize some efficiencies over time. That's a good thing because the cost of competition is high. You know, as you've seen over the last few years, it's gone up.\nYou know, it's all about us seizing opportunities to be able to continue this formula that works so well, and for us to continue to do what we do with this flywheel of success, we can't sit on our hands. You know, we have to be able to seize new opportunities, not necessarily to outperform the promises we made you. Those promises were really high, fulsome promises, but in some cases to achieve them in light of, you know, what we have seen in the past, which is some increased cost of competition, which at the end of the day is great for consumers.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nAll right, thank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will come from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you. A couple questions. Want to follow up on the private network question. When do you feel that private networks, 5G private networks, will become a material enough number on the revenues? An associated question, do you feel customers, whether it's consumer or enterprise, really understand what 5G means for them and why they should choose you with your head start? It just seems like the market is still just kind of like, oh, I'm not sure what 5G is.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nYou know, on the consumer piece I kind of agree. What people want is a really strong, powerful signal everywhere they go. That's what they want. 5G is a means for us to get them that better than anyone else. Whether or not they give us credit that the thing that got them that was 5G, I really don't care. We have the highest performing network with incredible reach of the high performing parts of our network, 5G, than anybody else. Like by far, like twice the land mass covered of Ultra Capacity 5G than our next closest competitor, and rapidly expanding as Ulf explained.\nYou're right, they don't really give 5G credit for that. What they want, make no mistake, is a very powerful signal everywhere they go, because they're watching video more than ever. They're glued to their TikTok, their Instagram stories, their sports, their YouTube, their videos, and their zooms. They don't want buffering. They want that signal with no latency, no buffering, and no jitter. That's the power of 5G, whether they give it credit or not. On the business side, I'll say the short version, which is we don't really know. I mean, whether you, to your question, literally, material means something in our company, and that's big.\nYou know, we're a big company. We don't know when it'll be bigger than a breadbasket, but we do know that we're best positioned to capture it. You know, as Peter pointed out back at our analyst day two plus years ago, we actually did not for that reason factor a lot of revenues in, or really any at all, from some of these advanced 5G network services. Our strategy was let's make sure we are best positioned to capture them.\nCallie, I think, very deftly explained some of the things that we're doing in this area with early adopting customers, but when it becomes something that's bigger than a breadbasket and really contributes, we don't really know. Because we didn't know, we made you no promises in our long range plan on it. I can tell you this promise: as that market develops, we are beautifully positioned to capture it.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, T-Mobile US\n\nGreat. All right. Looks like we're right at time, so I appreciate everybody joining us today. If you have any further questions, please reach out to either Investor Relations or the Media Relations Departments. We look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you.\n\nMike Sievert\n\nPresident and CEO, T-Mobile US\n\nThanks, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile first quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nAll right. Welcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; and as well as other members of the senior leadership team.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.\nOur earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, welcome to the call. And as you can see, we're coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington at our headquarters, and I'm here gathered with a great group of our senior leadership team as we share with you some terrific results that we are posting today to kick off 2023.\nAnd I'll start by saying our results for Q1 continue to demonstrate that no matter the competitive environment, our unique formula of offering the best network and the best value continues to produce best-in-class outcomes. We again led the industry in postpaid and broadband customer net adds while continuing to deliver the best profitability growth. And our consistent focus on reliably translating customer growth into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth and unlocking substantial cash flow gives us the confidence to raise our full year guidance just 1 quarter into the new year.\nNow I'll also say Q1 was a quarter of celebration at T-Mobile. I am so proud of how our now 10-year history of more than 20 Un-carrier moves have transformed to this wireless industry and more recently, broadband for the benefit of customers. And as you often hear us say, we won't stop.\nSo we announced last week our latest Un-carrier move with Phone Freedom, a move aimed to free customers and other wireless providers locked into those 3-year contracts, while they're subjected to relentless pricing changes and gadgets. We continue to make it easier for customers to come to T-Mobile and switch to T-Mobile for peace of mind, knowing that with price lock, we won't raise their price for top text and data.\nAnd now with [ new and two ], a part of Phone Freedom, they'll be upgrade-ready in 2 years because 3 years is too long to force customers to wait.\nHere's kind of a crazy sort of fact to get your head around. AT&T reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry this quarter. And yet quantitative research states that their customers have the highest self-reported likelihood of switching away. Their customers report being almost 50% more likely to switch than Verizon's or T-Mobile's customers.\nThe lowest churn, but the highest apparent dissatisfaction. And to me, that means one thing. Their customers are trapped and we're here to solve it. And that's what our latest Un-carrier move is all about. That's what Phone Freedom is all about. And it's the way we've been designing our groundbreaking Un-carrier moves for a full decade now.\nAnd as you know, we hit another milestone this month, the 3-year anniversary of our merger. We're wrapping up an integration that many have deemed, and I think we'll conclude that it is, the most successful merger in telecom history. And most of all, we're celebrating what it was always about, the dream we had of leapfrogging from last place in the 4G era to leadership in the 5G era, smashing the biggest pain point of all by finally giving customers in this industry both. The best network and the best value from the same provider. And you know what? We did it. And we did it ahead of schedule, meeting our commitments and unlocking massive value in the process.\nAnd yes, we brought about a new level of competition to this market and a 5G network to America that would not have been possible without this merger. And that makes customers and businesses everywhere, the real winners.\nSpeaking of network, another round of results are in, and our team is again celebrating wins as the largest, fastest and most awarded 5G network as well as the best overall network for the second quarter in a row according to Ookla. And this is not just a snapshot in time. It is a durable network lead. And I'm confident that [indiscernible] team in his new role as President of Technology, congratulations, and thank you for stepping in to lead us, will continue to keep us ahead in this race over the next years with our great spectrum assets in both depth and breadth deployed rapidly and our rapid execution of our unique process called customer-driven coverage, and finally, continued leadership in implementing advanced technologies such as stand-alone 5G and multi-carrier aggregation.\nAll of these things, importantly are contributing to the best capital efficiency in our sector. All of these strengths, coupled with our unique opportunity in underpenetrated markets are what enables a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition. And you know what, we showed that again in Q1.\nWe added 287,000 postpaid account net additions, the highest reported in the industry once again. And that means we're winning the switching decisions in the market because this looks at it at the account level. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.3 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. This included postpaid phone net adds of 538,000.\nWe won a higher share of net adds year-over-year even as the industry continues to moderate, just like we predicted we would in previous calls. Our increased share was driven by our strong phone gross adds as well as being the only national wireless provider to improve postpaid phone churn year-over-year.\nOur consistent approach to profitable growth continues to deliver right on and sometimes even above our ambitious plans. And that's even as the competitive landscape continues to shift and evolve.\nIn recent quarters, we've seen cable giving away 3 1st lines that don't, by the way, appear to be incrementally pulling from existing customers and incumbent providers but definitely are driving their ARPUs down.\nWe've seen AT&T and Verizon significantly outspend us in media advertising. I mean Verizon alone spent almost 60% more than T-Mobile in Q1. And we continue to see, as I mentioned earlier, others lean into expensive long-term device contract offers to lock up their customers, while T-Mobile was the only one who improve churn year-over-year and have the lowest upgrade rate. Improving churn, but with the lowest upgrades, that's because our approach is not to slam customers with expensive unwanted upgrade contracts to tie them down for 3 years.\nCustomers genuinely choose to stay with T-Mobile for the network, for the value proposition and for the experiences. And you know what, that's how we want it to be.\nYou've heard us say before, our strategy is differentiated and durable because it's driven by taking share in the places where we continue to be underpenetrated relative to the market, but where we now have new permission to win. This profitable growth playbook and the momentum we saw in Q1 is exactly what gives us the confidence to raise our postpaid net add and financial guidance for the year.\nA perfect example of this, T-Mobile for Business where we just posted one of our highest ever phone net add quarter in Q1 with the lowest business phone churn in our history and we're profitably taking share with more business account net adds and more business phone net adds than Verizon in the quarter.\nOn the consumer side, we're winning with prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs. In fact, our prime customer base hit an all-time high again this quarter.\nAnd in smaller markets and rural areas. We're now capturing a win share of switchers in the upper 30s, and that's in the roughly 2/3 of this geography where we're competing. This is great news because it's showing that our strategy here is very much on track.\nIn addition, we added 523,000 high-speed Internet customers as we have continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched 2 years ago. I would expect that we added more broadband customers than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the fourth consecutive quarter. And not only did we have the highest net adds, but our focus on profitable growth translated into strong financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 9% year-over-year and free cash flow up over 45%.\nOur Q1 results were just the latest example of how we have lots of room to run at T-Mobile and I'm confident in our ambitions for this year and beyond. One thing you've come to expect from this management team is that we are never satisfied. And you saw that again with our latest Un-carrier move to free customers from 3-year contracts and introduce new Go5G plans that offer even more value than before.\nAs proud as I am of what we've accomplished in our 10 years as the Un-carrier and in Q1 most recently, I am even more excited about what's ahead for T-Mobile. And I'm so thankful that all of you are on this journey with us. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about the key financial highlights and our updated guidance for '23.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you, Mike. 2023 is positioned to be another year of best-in-class profitable growth based on our Q1 results and the updated guidance I'll share with you in a moment.\nOur continued increases in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 6% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in a 9% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA, and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points year-over-year while AT&T and Verizon were flat to down.\nIn addition, as Mike mentioned, free cash flow was up over 45% and unlock the highest free cash flow margin relative to our peers. We expect our industry-leading free cash flow margin to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 33 million shares for $4.8 billion in Q1, with a cumulative total of 59.4 million shares repurchased for $8.5 billion as of April 21.\nIt was also great to see our continued execution on profitable growth reflected in the recent rating upgrades from both Moody's to Baa2 and Fitch who recently upgraded us 2 notches to BBB+. These rating increases further strengthen our access to lower cost capital in the deep investment grade market.\nAll right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid phone net customer additions -- total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.7 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities. And we continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year.\nOur focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectations, which are now expected to be between $28.8 million and $29.2 billion, this is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies, of course, excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end.\nOur merger synergies are expected to be between $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching the full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the recently raised run rate synergy target of $8 billion in 2024.\nWe continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we also continue to expect cash merger-related costs of $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to date.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, which includes payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion, driven by a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership.\nWe expect Q2 to remain elevated, just slightly lower than Q1 and then moderating in the back half of the year. Together, this results in higher free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, which is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nAnd as I mentioned, this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers. And based on the cadence of CapEx, I would expect free cash flow in Q2 to be slightly higher than Q1 and then ramp in the back half of the year.\nWe continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023.\nAll right. Before I wrap up, I want to give a quick update on the sale of our wireline assets to [ Cogent ]. The process is progressing very smoothly led by Dave and the team at [ Cogent ] and we now expect the transaction to close in early May.\nOn a quarterly basis, this will lead to approximately $125 million lower wholesale and other service revenue and approximately $175 million lower cost of service expenses with a nominal impact to SG&A. With the mid-quarter closing, we expect a partial impact in Q2 with the full quarter impact beginning in Q3.\nSo in closing, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership, and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud?",

Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.\nOur earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. As you can see, we're here in New York City with the whole senior team, and I am very much looking forward to talking about 2022 and a look ahead to what, I think, is going to be an even more exciting future.\n2022 was a record year for our company. It was our best year ever. We welcomed more customers to the Un-carrier than ever before in our history, and we translated this customer growth to industry-leading financial growth, finishing with a strong Q4. Our T-Mobile team delivered at or above the high end of our guidance across the board.\n2022 was also the biggest investment year in our history. By accelerating these investments, we rewrote the competitive dynamic on network competition for good and laid the foundation for a highly capital-efficient run rate business beginning this year.\nWhen I took responsibility as CEO almost 3 years ago, I spoke to you about an opportunity we saw that if we could execute well, we can position T-Mobile to be the first company in our space to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value, breaking a decades old forced choice on consumers and businesses.\nWhile the results are in, with the latest network awards, and we've done it. T-Mobile is not only the 5G leader, but now the overall network leader, and this opens big growth pathways for our future. Along the way, we successfully completed the Sprint customer migration and network shutdown faster than planned, while also delivering industry-leading growth in both customers and cash flows through our differentiated and profitable growth strategy. And we launched our most ambitious ESG initiatives ever.\nOur financial outcomes allowed us to accelerate our network deployments and begin share repurchases earlier than planned. And looking ahead to 2023, we're very confident in our differentiated strategy. In fact, we're on track to meet or exceed all of the aspirations for this year that we shared with you way back at our Analyst Day in early 2021. I'm excited to talk more about all of this today, and let's start with our merger integration.\nBack when we closed the merger, few people would have thought that we could shut down the Sprint network faster than planned and deliver the lowest churn in our history at the same time, but that's exactly what our team did. We moved all Sprint customers off the network and completed the decom of Sprint sites, all within 2.5 years.\nAnd not only that, we had our best postpaid phone churn year in the company's history at just 0.88, and we were the only one in the industry to deliver year-over-year improvement for full year 2022.\nDiving into network. While T-Mobile has been the clear 5G leader for years, we can now say that T-Mobile has the best overall network in the United States. That is a big statement. For the first time ever, T-Mobile won a clean sweep across every single overall network category in Ookla's recent report.\nAnd recent data from OpenSignal and umlaut also show T-Mobile as the clear leader. With over 12 billion data points across these network coverage and performance tests, the facts show T-Mobile is the new network leader.\nAnd this brings with it an exciting new opportunity. Convincing people that this 30-year forced choice between network and value is gone when you choose T-Mobile. This is no small task, but our results show that more and more people are beginning to notice, and they're choosing T-Mobile.\nIn fact, our results in '22 demonstrated how differentiated and effective our growth strategy really is. Kind of feels like deja vu. When I think back to this time last year, and everyone was worried about what would happen when industry growth began to normalize. And I sense that's top of mind for everyone again as we enter 2023.\nWell, it didn't show up immediately last year. The industry did see lower year-over-year growth in the second half. And guess what? Our unique ability to offer customers both the best network and the best value across multiple new and underpenetrated segments of the market led to T-Mobile's best growth year ever, with 2 of our best quarter since the merger coming in the second half, even as market growth began to normalize.\nWe posted a record 1.4 million postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry once again. We're winning the highest share of switching decisions in the industry through our core growth strategies. And we delivered our highest-ever postpaid net adds of over 6.4 million, above the high end of our recently raised guidance. This included our highest postpaid phone net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 3.1 million.\nWe've explained it before. Our strategy is differentiated and durable because it's driven by taking share in places where we're massively underpenetrated relative to the competition and where we now have the winning hand, including T-Mobile for Business, where we just delivered one of our highest ever phone net add quarters in Q4.\nAnd we're clearly having an impact on the incumbents, as you can see in Verizon's highest-ever business churn in 2022. In the top 100 markets for consumer, we're winning with prime network seekers who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs and at a lower cost.\nWe're only beginning to tap into this new opportunity. And in smaller markets in rural areas, where we're bringing a better value proposition and a better network to new geographies we really didn't play in before, we're capturing a win share of switchers in the high 30s, which says a lot because in many of these places, we're only just getting started.\nIn addition, we added 2 million high-speed Internet customers in our first full year since our commercial launch. In fact, T-Mobile had more broadband net adds in '22 than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. This is a powerful new phenomenon for our brand, in addition to being a good business.\nAnd not only did we deliver industry-leading customer growth, but our focus on profitable growth translated into industry best financial performance, with core adjusted EBITDA up 12% year-over-year and free cash flow up 36%.\nThe investments we've made in 2022, including in our cybersecurity capabilities, showed up in a critical way a few weeks ago. I want to take a moment to address the recent cyber incident. After address -- identifying a criminal attempt to access our data through an API, we shut it down within 24 hours. And more importantly, our systems and policies protected the most sensitive kinds of customer data from being accessed.\nWe take this issue very seriously. While I am disappointed that the criminal actor was able to obtain any customer information, we are confident that our aggressive cybersecurity plan, working with the support of some of the world's experts, will allow us to achieve our goal of becoming second-to-none in this area.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a more connected and sustainable future. Nearly 3 years ago, we launched our digital divide initiative called Project 10Million to bring connectivity to underserved students nationwide with free or highly subsidized service, and I am proud to say we're now more than halfway to achieving our goal. To date, we've provided $4.8 billion in services and connected more than 5.3 million students, and we're not slowing down.\nWe're also working hard to create a more sustainable future, recently committing to our most ambitious sustainability goal yet to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040. This makes T-Mobile one of the only 4 Fortune 100 companies to do so.\nOur work in this space is being recognized, including being named in the top 20 of JUST Capital's 2023 rankings, which measures companies against metrics that matter to our communities, including environmental impact, where we ranked #1 in our industry.\nOkay. Let me wrap up with some comments on 2023 and what's ahead. With these record results, we've clearly shown that our differentiated strategy has lots of room to run. And I strongly believe that this will prove to be the case, even as industry as a whole is seeing moderating growth and potentially a challenging macroeconomic environment.\nIn fact, it may be especially true in that case as our unique high-quality positioning is proving remarkably well suited to the times. We believe 2023 will also be a year in which we begin to see the payoff in terms of EBITDA and massive cash flow expansion, of years of work, on merger integration, synergy attainment and the most ambitious network build in U.S. history, all of which are mostly behind us now, and an ongoing differentiated profitable growth, which is durable results in front of us. I could not be more proud of this team and our employees, and I am so excited for all that's ahead in 2023 and beyond.\nOkay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and our guidance for 2023.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAwesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our 2022 results highlighted our strong execution in accelerating the merger integration, while leveraging our network leadership to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers.\nThis translated into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 8% in 2022. We delivered core adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 billion, up 12%, and reaching a record high and at the high end of our recently raised guidance. We realized approximately $6 billion of synergies in 2022 or roughly the total run rate synergies expected in our original merger plan in 2018.\nOur strong margin expansion also unlocked rapid free cash flow growth, which grew at an industry-best 36% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, and that's even after funding our peak CapEx year in 2022.\nThis strong financial performance allowed us to commence our share buybacks ahead of our original 2023 time line. We repurchased 16.5 million shares for $2.3 billion in Q4, bringing the cumulative total repurchased to 21.4 million shares for $3 billion in 2022. This is such an exciting start to this opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value.\nSo let's talk about how our great execution and investments in '22 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2023. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated growth strategy, even while expecting total industry net additions to be down versus 2022.\nThis guidance assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones. That profitable growth leads to core adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be between $28.7 billion and $29.2 billion, or up 10% at the midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies and above our Analyst Day guidance for 2023. This excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end.\nOur merger synergies are expected to further ramp to between $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching a full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule.\nAnd thanks to great execution by the teams, we not only delivered accelerated synergies, but now also expect higher run rate synergies of approximately $8 billion in 2024, of which approximately $2 billion is avoided cost, which is consistent with the amount expected at our Analyst Day.\nWith the major integration work now behind us, we expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes and is expected to be front-end loaded with roughly 40% expected in Q1. This is expected to be the last year of material merger-related costs from a P&L perspective.\nAnd just as we have highlighted at Analyst Day, cash payments related to merger costs have underrun the P&L recognition to date and are expected to invert and be between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023, with almost half of that total heading in Q1.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, including these payments for merger-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $17.8 billion to $18.3 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership.\nI would expect this to be a bit more weighted towards the first half of the year. Our capital efficience and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network.\nTogether, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And this also represents a free cash flow service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers.\nTurning now to taxes. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023, as we continuously win and then deepen our account relationships.\nAltogether, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.

We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.\nOur earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Thanks, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter call. Thanks for tuning in. It is so great to be back to talk about another quarter of outstanding results by this team. Our differentiated strategy is working. Our ongoing focus on delivering the best value while simultaneously capitalizing on our network leadership position has delivered another quarter of industry-leading growth in customers, EBITDA and cash flow. And we're raising our 2022 guidance for the third consecutive quarter this year. All of this while completing our biggest integration milestone. I am incredibly proud of this team.\nAs we told you when our merger closed, our plan was to expand on our fame as the industry's best value while building and becoming known for having the best network in the country, finally giving customers the ability to have both from one provider for the first time ever. Now just 2.5 years later, we're doing exactly what we planned. Our brand strength for value leadership has never been better. And it's been further aided by our competitors' price increases.\nAnd our long-established 5G lead is translating to overall network leadership for the first time and giving customers the beginnings of really a powerful network that they're really noticing. Our results this quarter are a clear demonstration of how differentiated and sustainable our growth strategy really is.\nOnly T-Mobile has both this unique combination of network and value leadership and multiple large-scale new and underpenetrated segments to tap into.\nTo grow our business, we are also driving innovation where it matters most for customers. Through Magenta MAX, our most popular plan and the best expression of T-Mobile's 5G network, we're providing features that are meaningful to customers in their daily lives like with the recent addition of Apple TV+ and our Un-carrier move, Coverage Beyond. Well, we're not just keeping people connected on the ground, but also in the air and when they go abroad. With the launch of Easy Switch and Network Pass, we're making it simple and risk-free to experience our network and make the switch to T-Mobile.\nIt has long been established that T-Mobile is the 5G leader. But with the rapidly growing adoption of 5G by consumers and businesses, we're now seeing that 5G lead translate into overall network leadership. And to back it up, we're beginning to win more third-party recognition for our network leadership from multiple third parties like Ookla, umlaut and PCMagazine. This is precisely the network evolution that we planned. We knew that 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that's exactly what is now unfolding.\nAnd speaking of network, we just hit our biggest merger integration milestone. By the end of Q3, we had successfully decommissioned substantially all targeted Sprint macro sites, more than a year earlier than our original merger plan. And our Ultra Capacity 5G now reaches 250 million Americans. Think about that. Today, we're already where Verizon hopes to be more than 2 years from now.\nAnd we're not stopping. We recognize the importance of coverage to customers, and we will continue to pursue more opportunities to ensure our network is there for them whenever and wherever they need us. This lean and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach will guide us as we enhance and expand our network to even higher levels and in a capital-efficient way using our spectrum resources.\nWe also recognize that there are some places where it's just not practical for any wireless operator to build a terrestrial network. But because we want T-Mobile customers to have peace of mind that we have them covered no matter where they go, in Q3, we announced our joint effort with SpaceX to do just that, combining a slice of our mid-band spectrum that's already compatible with existing customer devices with next-gen satellite technology from SpaceX. Our goal is for T-Mobile customers to be connected anywhere in the U.S. where they can see the sky.\nOverall, this differentiated growth strategy and emerging network leadership produced another quarter of truly differentiated results. So let's get right into them. In Q3, we posted a record 394,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry again. Winning the switching decisions in this industry and growing share through our core growth strategies I've outlined for you many times is the central growth ambition of our company. And this quarter, we did that better than ever before.\nIn addition, our network and value proposition are consistently attracting the industry's best customers, which is contributing to an all-time high in our customer prime mix. And we delivered an industry-best 1.6 million postpaid net additions, more than AT&T and Verizon combined.\nWe had our highest postpaid phone net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 854,000. Our postpaid phone churn of just 0.88% improved 8 basis points from last year. Once again, we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. And our postpaid phone churn, including Sprint, was lower than Verizon's for the second consecutive quarter.\nAnd as I said, our multiple growth opportunities are all contributing to this success. Consider smaller markets in rural areas, which include 40% of the U.S. population. At the end of last year, we only had a competitive network and distribution to effectively compete in 30% of those households. Today, thanks to our accelerated network build, we have already surpassed our year-end target to compete in 50% of these households, and we now expect to reach roughly 60% by the end of this year.\nWe also continue to grow in the top 100 markets as we win the prime network seekers who are increasingly recognizing that T-Mobile has the best network for them, an audience we never effectively competed for in the past. We achieved share leadership in many of these markets in the past without winning on network. All of that is changing. So the same advantages in network and value proposition that are driving growth in smaller markets and rural areas where we're underpenetrated and are driving it in the top 100 where we've always been strong. In fact, our net account growth in the quarter was split roughly equally between these two geographic segments.\nOkay. Let's talk business. We continue to win business customers from incumbents as T-Mobile for Business continues to build momentum, delivering one of our highest ever postpaid phone net addition quarters in Q3. The impact we're having can be clearly seen in Verizon's business churn, which was up again at the highest levels they've ever reported. Meanwhile, we added more business accounts and had lower business phone churn than Verizon in the quarter, delivering one of our lowest ever postpaid phone churn quarters for business.\nOur 5G network leadership, particularly as it relates to our lead in advanced 5G services, is increasingly enabling us to become a strategic partner for enterprises and for government agencies.\nOkay. Let me briefly touch on high-speed Internet where net additions of 578,000 hit another record high. And once again, we expect to lead the industry in net adds. In fact, I anticipate that T-Mobile had more broadband net additions than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the second quarter in a row. In addition, our high-speed Internet attracted consumers and businesses who are new to T-Mobile at an increasing pace, establishing new relationships that we can grow with additional products and services over time. In just 1.5 years since our commercial launch, we now serve more than 2 million customers with Net Promoter Scores more than 30 points higher than cable and even higher than the average fiber provider.\nThese results demonstrate that our differentiated growth strategy and our Un-carrier playbook to provide customers with the best value and the best network continues to win, and our differentiation is a particular source of strength in this ever-changing competitive and macroeconomic environment.\nAnd importantly, we translated our leading customer growth into industry-leading financial growth in postpaid service revenues, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. This momentum has enabled us to raise our guidance every quarter this year, including today.\nFinally, as you know, thanks to our strong execution and confidence in the future, our Board authorized a substantial share repurchase program and did so earlier than our initial Analyst Day plans to begin in 2023. I could not be prouder of this team and of these results.\nOkay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and some more information on our guidance.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. It's such a pleasure to watch this team reliably deliver on our commitments, and we did it yet again with another strong quarter in Q3. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customer accounts resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth once again, up 7% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on driving profitability translated at strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, into year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11%. That increase in customers and profitability is driving industry-leading operating and free cash flow expansion and further unlocks the massive cash flow potential of our business.\nThese robust operating results also enabled us to achieve two major financial milestones. First, we're extremely proud to have reached an investment-grade rating from all three major agencies, opening access to a much deeper and cost-effective capital pool for the company. We also closed our first asset-backed securities issuance related to our equipment receivables, which provides yet another established and attractive capital source as we continue to be opportunistic in optimizing both our capital structure and cost.\nAnd second, as Mike mentioned, we commenced the significant share repurchase program in September, and we repurchased 4.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $669 million in Q3. Cumulatively, through October 20, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $1.5 billion.\nAlso in Q3, we announced the planned sale of our wireline business, which resulted in a pretax loss of $1.1 billion that had substantially no cash impact to the quarter. This includes the financial liability associated with the commercial take-or-pay arrangement, the impairment to the carrying value of the associated assets and other cost to sell. The transaction is not expected to have any material financial impact to 2023 based on the expected closing time line.\nAll right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on reducing churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year.\nTurning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between 26.2 billion and 26.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year at the midpoint and up 150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and increased merger synergies. Core adjusted EBITDA excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing.\nWe now expect merger synergies to be between $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint, primarily as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning.\nMerger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA, are expected to be between $4.8 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network decommissioning activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, are now expected to be in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.5 billion up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance.\nTurning to cash CapEx. We now expect it to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is up $200 million at the midpoint, reflecting the ongoing robust pace of our 5G deployment and success in high-speed Internet where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, higher by $50 million at the midpoint. This results in free cash flow increasing by more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investments and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nWe now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 17% and 19% based on favorability, primarily from nonrecurring benefits we've seen year-to-date. Additionally, we continue to expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year driven by continued customer adoption of value-added services, including Magenta MAX. And with greater success in attracting new to T-Mobile customers with high-speed Internet, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up in the mid- to high 2% range.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP of IR, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. All right, let's get to your questions. (Operator Instructions) Let's start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.",

Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP of IR, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to the quarter as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. Also, we're in a quiet period for Auction 108, so we cannot discuss or comment on anything related to the 2.5 gigahertz licenses.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. Well, you can see, if you're watching us live on the Web stream, we've got most of our senior team here in New York City today, and we are here to share our Q2 results. And I am extremely proud of our team for delivering another quarter of great results while completing major integration milestones.\nQ2 was another strong quarter of industry-leading growth for us in customers, postpaid service revenues and EBITDA. And based on our momentum, we are raising our full year guidance across the board again. This just shows that the Un-carrier playbook, putting customers first and providing them with the best value and the best network, continues to work in a competitive climate and in the changing macroeconomic environment.\nBefore I go into our results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge this challenging economic climate for consumers and businesses and what T-Mobile is doing to help customers stay connected. Inflation has been dominating headlines and dinner table conversations. It's a reality that millions of American families are facing as prices every day for essentials are skyrocketing all around them. That's why we did what the Un-carrier does best with 3 big moves last quarter to help customers when they need it most. Prioritizing customers' needs is exactly what continues to fuel our growth.\nOthers in the industry notified their customers that their already overpriced bills are going up when they could least afford it. Naturally, some have asked when will T-Mobile raise its rates. Well, building on our proud history as the Un-carrier, our answer is that we're not. Instead, we introduced price lock. We're standing by our commitment to customers and those who switched to T-Mobile that we won't raise the price of their rate plans.\nWe're here to help broadband customers across the country as well with our recent launch of Internet Freedom. Broadband customers are some of the least satisfied in America, the fees, the contracts, the price hikes, the terrible customer service, it's all ridiculous. And it looks a lot like the wireless industry a decade ago. But it's all changing because we're making it easy for customers to break up with big Internet, lock in their price and finally feel appreciated.\nAnd we made T-Mobile Business Internet available nationwide, which makes T-Mobile the first and only nationwide Internet provider for business. And third, we saw another opportunity to help customers as travel is on the rebound. But like everything else, travel has become more expensive and more complicated. So T-Mobile launched Coverage Beyond to help people get back out there and save money while doing it.\nWe've got customers covered across the U.S., on their airline flights, on the road and in more than 210 countries and destinations. This is what the Un-carrier is all about, chasing down customer pain points and smashing them. And right now, with this economy, there are a lot of pain points out there. And you know what? This strategy works again and again.\nWe delivered another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth. In fact, we posted a record 380,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I've said before, this measure of total billing relationships is a strong barometer that we're winning the switching decisions in this industry.\nI know the competitive market trends are top of mind, and here's what we saw in Q2. Postpaid switching activity increased year-over-year, and we benefited from more than our fair share of those switching decisions. Importantly, our network and brand are consistently attracting the industry's best customers, driving the prime mix of our customer base to an all-time high.\nAnd we delivered our highest ever Q2 postpaid net additions with an industry best 1.7 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined again. This includes 723,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped 13 basis points sequentially to 0.80%, and we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year.\nIn fact, delivering lower churn than Verizon for the first time ever on a combined basis, including Sprint. The fact that our all-in churn, including Sprint, is trending so strongly just 2 years out from our merger shows our team's fantastic progress, and it is exactly what we told you would happen.\nOkay. Let's talk about high-speed Internet, where our team delivered 560,000 net additions. I'm pretty confident that we'll see T-Mobile as the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry for the third consecutive quarter and most likely by a wide margin.\nDemand continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. I am so excited to see our broadband business hit this pace, which puts us right on track to meet the multiyear ambitions we shared with you last year.\nWe continue to see great customer adoption of Magenta MAX, which is helping drive our strong ARPU and ARPA trends. With the trends we're seeing, we now expect postpaid ARPA to be up roughly 3% in 2022. These results reflect our differentiated strategy to unlock growth across smaller markets and rural areas, T-Mobile for Business, network seekers in the top 100 markets who hadn't previously considered us, and in new product categories like 5G broadband.\nThey also reflect the strength of our network leadership, as supported by nearly every third party. Recent reports from Ookla and PCMagazine not only recognize T-Mobile for the fastest and most available 5G network, but for the best overall network experience. And OpenSignal recently reported that not only did our average speeds increase yet again, the gap over the competition widened even further despite their C-band deployments. We are winning this race. And as I've been telling you, we plan to stay ahead.\nAnd speaking of network, we just hit some major integration milestones. Just over 2 years since we closed the merger, we have successfully shut down most of the Sprint network. As of the end of the quarter, we had cumulatively decommissioned nearly 2/3 of the 35,000 targeted sites and can now report that we will be substantially complete by the end of Q3 this current quarter. Remarkable work by the team to deliver these milestones ahead even of our recent year-end target and more than a year earlier than our original merger plan.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to touch on cybersecurity, following the criminal attack we experienced roughly a year ago. Protecting our customers' data is a top priority for the company, which is why following the attack, we immediately took additional steps to protect our customers. We created a cyber transformation office and engaged some of the top -- world's top experts to help.\nWe're investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance our data security tools and capabilities to transform our cybersecurity program. We always knew that there would unfortunately be financial consequences from this attack, and we were pleased to recently reach settlements that will resolve the class actions and most of the consumer claims.\nTogether, we believe these settlements will represent the biggest component of those impacts. These costs were contemplated in our financial guidance and the amounts are consistent with precedents we've seen in other similar agreements. We're now focused on moving forward as we continue to invest in and enhance our company's cybersecurity.\nOkay. Let me give a quick recap before I hand things over to Peter. I am very pleased with our company's performance and progress against our ambitious multiyear goals. Again, this quarter, we outperformed against our plans and again led the industry in net additions of postpaid customers and growth in postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. And as a result, we raised our guidance across the board again.\nThe Un-carrier value proposition resonates, and it's so well tuned to the (inaudible). People want the best network and now more than ever they wanted at the best value from a team that's obsessed with their satisfaction. Our strategy is so simple, but maybe that's why it works quarter after quarter, year after year.\nOkay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights from Q2 and our increased guidance for 2022 in more detail.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered another strong quarter with our Q2 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 9% year-over-year.\nThat strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% for the second quarter in a row. This just highlights our profitable growth strategy when compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA margins that you see from others in our industry. That growth in profitability fueled higher operating cash flow and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network.\nAnd finally, I wanted to highlight a few special items that impacted earnings for the quarter. As we foreshadowed last quarter with the shutdown of the Sprint network, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business. As a result, we took a noncash impairment charge of $477 million on a pretax basis in Q2.\nIn addition, we recorded a $400 million pretax charge related to the $350 million class action settlement and other expenses from the data breach a year ago, which was within our guidance expectations for the year.\nAll right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance across the board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6 million and 6.3 million, up 600,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on reducing Sprint churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds will be coming from phones for the full year.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, the net adds guidance does not include the subset of customers who we do not expect to migrate upon our network sunsets, which were treated as a base adjustment. As we began the orderly network shutdowns at the end of Q2, we took an adjustment of 284,000 postpaid phones in line with what we had guided, as well as 946,000 postpaid other devices that were not practical to be upgraded.\nTurning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $26 billion and $26.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and merger synergies. This excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing.\nWe now expect merger synergies to be between $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, up $200 million at the midpoint as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA, are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities.\nWith Q2 being the peak quarter, we expect that Q3 will be closer to Q1 levels, and then taper off in Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, are now expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance.\nTurning to cash CapEx. We now expect it to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion, which is up $250 million at the midpoint with both the robust pace of our 5G deployment and our success in high-speed Internet, where we capitalize the routers.\nTogether, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion, which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nWe continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we successfully executed our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 3%, and we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to celebrate an important milestone of achieving an investment-grade corporate family rating for the first time in our company's history. With the Moody's upgrade last week, in addition to our existing investment-grade rating from Fitch, T-Mobile now has investment-grade ratings from 2 of the 3 top ratings agencies. This is proof of the investment community's confidence in our Un-carrier playbook, delivering on our substantial -- delivering on our accelerated merger integration and synergies executing on our differentiated growth strategy and our ability to translate that into unprecedented free cash flow.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.",

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP of IR, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the T-Mobile First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team.\nDuring the call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other materials that accompany our Q1 results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP disclosures can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, what an exciting time right now at T-Mobile. We have a lot to cover, but we'll keep our comments brief this time so that we can get right to your questions.\nWe just celebrated the 2-year anniversary of this merger. We delivered another exciting outperformance in Q1 to kick off 2022. We're in the home stretch of our accelerated integration. And we're raising our guidance for the year across the board based on the momentum that we see in our business.\nIt's hard to believe that it's already been 2 years since we closed our merger with Sprint. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished as we have consistently exceeded not only our own targets, but also Wall Street's expectations.\nOne of the cornerstones of our merger advocacy was that we would lead the U.S. into the 5G era. And I don't think very many people anticipated what we've already achieved in just 2 years. We now cover 315 million people with 5G. That's 95% of all Americans. And our 5G geographic coverage with dedicated low-band spectrum is more than Verizon and AT&T have combined, which both, by the way, are still largely sharing spectrum with their LTE networks.\nPerhaps our greatest impact though was to awaken the industry to the transformational performance of mid-band spectrum for Ultra Capacity 5G. We already cover 225 million Americans, and nearly 85% of all T-Mobile customers with these game-changing experiences. We caused others to pivot from an apparent willingness to leave fast 5G to a select few customers within arm's reach of a millimeter wave site. And now we see them greatly increasing their investments in mid-band spectrum and deployment. They are trying to chase us but only to realize they will be and are years behind T-Mobile.\nPre-merger, we laid out a plan to realize massive synergies from our scale and efficiencies only to raise our run rate synergy expectations by 25% after closing the merger. We're delivering these synergies bigger and faster than expected to the benefit of our shareholders.\nAnd synergies are ramping up even further this year as we're approaching some of our biggest milestones, including moving the remaining customers off the Sprint network in the next couple of month just over 2 years from merger close. And we're also on track to upgrade or decommission substantially all of the Sprint sites this year, less than 3 years from close. We've been selectively decommissioning sites since the merger close. And as of Q1, we've decommissioned roughly 1/3 of the 35,000 targeted sites, with the big push coming in the second half of this year. Remarkable execution by the team as we pulled these milestones forward by more than a year.\nAt the Un-carrier, we're committed to use our 5G leadership and synergies for the good of consumers and businesses, eliminating the biggest pain point in this industry where customers were forced to make trade-offs between network quality and value. As the only national wireless provider with a clearly articulated and differentiated growth strategy, we have led the industry in postpaid customer and service revenue growth in the 2 years since the merger closed. In that time, we've delivered roughly 2 million postpaid account net adds, and 11.5 million postpaid net adds, including an industry-best 5.3 million postpaid phone net adds.\nWe were also the only national wireless operator to deliver double-digit growth in both service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA over that period. And we accomplished this while building the foundation for sustainable growth platforms across enterprise and government, smaller markets in rural areas, prime consumers in the largest 100 markets and bringing real competition to broadband.\nWe've unlocked new experiences for consumers, like the first truly unlimited 5G plan with Magenta MAX. And we've established T-Mobile as the fastest-growing broadband provider, bringing a better product and value proposition to over 40 million potential households and already serving over 1 million customers, just a year after our commercial launch.\nWe are carrying this momentum right into 2022, delivering another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth in Q1 built on the incredible momentum of our Magenta brand.\nWe added 348,000 postpaid account net adds, our highest Q1 ever and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I've said before, this measure of our total billing relationships is the best barometer that we're winning the switching decisions in this industry. While others appear to be leaning into adding lines to their base, we are focused on growing the number of customer relationships and then deepening them over time across our products and services.\nAnd we delivered our highest Q1 postpaid net adds in 8 years with an industry best 1.3 million. That's more postpaid nets than AT&T and Verizon combined. This includes 589,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped by a whopping 17 basis points from Q4 to just 0.93, the industry best improvement both year-over-year and sequentially. We were the only national wireless operator to improve churn year-over-year as our competitors saw their churn increase. This integration-driven churn improvement really matters because our phone gross adds were the highest in the industry yet again in Q1. In fact, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q1 would have been closer to 900,000.\nAnd I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where we had 338,000 net adds and I expect will be the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry for the second consecutive quarter. Demand just continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas.\nOur Net Promoter Scores continue to improve quarter-over-quarter and, are now more than 3x the average NPS scores for cable customers. The best part is we're just getting started bringing the Un-carrier to broadband. So stay tuned for what we have in store next.\nMagenta MAX continues to see great adoption from customers, which is helping to drive strong ARPU and ARPA trends, and we still have lots of room for further growth. With the trends that we're seeing, we now expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up roughly 1% in 2022.\nIn addition, we continue to see our prime mix of credit apps increased on a year-over-year basis each quarter, showing that our network and our brand are consistently attracting the industry's best customers.\nWe continue to see good momentum in smaller markets and rural areas as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. The team is executing our precision playbook here to a T, coordinating the network and distribution build-outs to unlock new experiences community by community. We ended 2021 effectively competing in about 30% of households in these markets and will continue to expand to more than half of households in smaller markets by the end of this year.\nOur new accounts from smaller markets and rural areas grew 40% year-over-year in Q1. And these markets are also a great example of where our high-speed Internet is helping to open doors for us to drive mobile penetration.\nT-Mobile for Business continues to build mind share with enterprise and government customers on the strength of our network and our ever-expanding suite of products and services. We've built strong momentum across major verticals now, such as the financial sector, where we continue to expand the list of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for secure and compliant connectivity for their hybrid mobile workforce.\nOur network performance has also been a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile just in Q1. We recently introduced the first 5G connected cars in America with Magenta Drive for BMW. And we continue to be on the leading edge of advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our significant and durable 5G network advantage.\nOkay. Let me wrap up. It's been a remarkable run in the first 2 years since our merger. We've unlocked better experiences for consumers and businesses by offering the best value and the promise of the best network for the first time in this industry's history. We've unlocked shareholder value through industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and service revenues while delivering merger synergies bigger and faster than originally planned. We're off to a great start in 2022 with a beat-and-raise quarter that not only led this industry in growth of postpaid customers, but also service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. And positioned us to raise our guidance across the board just 1 quarter into the year.\nOur team is excited to carry all this momentum through the rest of '22, and I'll let Peter take you through our key financial highlights from Q1 and our increased guidance in more detail. Peter?\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we started off 2022 with very strong Q1 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and highest postpaid phone ARPU growth in the last 5 years resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on our merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA that you see from others in our industry. That growth and profitability fueled higher operating cash flow even with higher merger-related costs and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow of over 25% while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network.\nSo let's talk about how our great execution in Q1 set us up to raise guidance across the board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.8 million, up 300,000 at the midpoint, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue our accelerated Sprint customer migration.\nWe continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year more weighted to the second half, with the Sprint migration impacts more in the first half and expansion in smaller markets and rural areas building throughout the year. Consistent with Q1, this net adds guidance does not include the small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint networks, which will be treated as a base adjustment.\nAs we began the CDMA sunset at the end of Q1, we took an adjustment of 212,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 349,000 postpaid other devices, which were largely low ARPU IoT devices. We expect to begin the LTE sunset at the end of Q2 and estimate a base adjustment of approximately 300,000 postpaid phones and between 700,000 and 900,000 lower ARPU postpaid other devices. The anticipated impact of these adjustments is relatively immaterial and fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.\nTurning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $25.8 billion and $26.2 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, which is up $150 million from the prior guidance, driven by our growth in service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues, which we continue to expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we transition Sprint customers off device leasing.\nWe now expect merger synergies to be between $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and weighted to the second half of the year, primarily as we unlock more network savings as site decommissioning accelerates. As a result of timing of synergies within the year, the impacts from the Sprint network onset and an expected slight sequential decline in wholesale revenue, we expect core adjusted EBITDA in Q2 to be similar to Q1 and then higher in the second half.\nMerger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA are still expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. We expect slightly over 1/3 of the total to occur in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $15.7 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $100 million from the prior guidance.\nWith the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, we now expect cash CapEx to be between $13.2 billion and $13.5 billion, which is up $100 million at the midpoint as we capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer network experience.\nTogether, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nWe continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And additionally, as we execute our strategy to continuously deepen our cap relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 2%. As Mike also mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 1% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX.\nAnd finally, with the shutdown of the Sprint CDMA and LTE networks, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business, triggering an impairment analysis. As a result of the wireless network shutdown, we anticipate a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million in Q2. The cessation of wireless traffic also enables monetization of certain wireless assets to the wireline assets, which were previously supporting the wireless traffic. Any cash monetization of these wireline assets would be recorded as gains in future periods if they occur.\nAltogether, we see 2022 as another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. What I find most exciting is our unique opportunity to unlock significant free cash flow by delivering industry-leading growth in customers, service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A.",

Please note that today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP of IR, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Welcome to the T-Mobile Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; and Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. It may cause -- forward-looking or may cause actual results to differ materially, which we have in our SEC filings and I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our Q4 and full year results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics are all available on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nG. Michael Sievert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jud. Well, my buddy and I here are excited to be here today to discuss another remarkable year at T-Mobile. We shared with you a year ago that 2021 would be a foundational year for us as a merged company, a year in which we set bold goals for ourselves in terms of customer growth, profitability, network leadership and merger integration. Well, we not only exceeded our own targets, but also Wall Street's expectations.\nWe are experiencing the greatest growth momentum in our history, setting record customer growth and service revenue growth, all because of the important investments we've made and will continue to make in our network leadership and in underpenetrated markets. This momentum sets us up for a very strong 2022 with plans to deliver another year of industry-leading postpaid growth, 10% in core adjusted EBITDA and over 30% growth in free cash flow at the midpoint of our guidance. We have big aspirations for this year, as Peter will explain more about in a minute.\nOur historic network build is a driving force behind our growth opportunity, and it's central to unlocking our merger synergies. For the second year in a row, we set an audacious goal for Neville and the technology team, and they crushed it yet again. We set our sights on getting Ultra Capacity 5G to 200 million people, and the team blew right past that goal, reaching 210 million in 2021. This is no small feat when you consider that it takes roughly 3x the number of cell site upgrades to get from 100 million to 200 million.\nAnd that gives you a sense of the challenge that AT&T and Verizon have ahead of them. Once they woke up to our 5G lead and differentiation, they finally began lighting up mid-band 5G POPs, but still only tens of millions compared to our hundreds of millions. According to their own build plan, it will take them multiple years to reach 200 million people, and they still won't be anywhere near the depth of mid-band spectrum that we're putting to work across our larger footprint. This demonstrates the remarkable deployment machine that we have spent years building and how hard it is to replicate.\nAnd don't forget our extended-range 5G reached 94% of all Americans at the end of 2021 with speeds double that of typical LTE. This reinforces the importance of not just having the best spectrum portfolio, but how quickly T-Mobile puts spectrum to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses.\nWe continue to add to our mid-band portfolio with our recent purchase in Auction 110. Once again, our prudent and opportunistic approach meant that we concentrated on supplementing our mid-band spectrum holdings in major urban and suburban areas, mostly aligned with our C-band purchases and importantly, in places where these frequencies are well suited to the density of our network grid. That means we'll be able to deliver meaningful customer benefit with very little network capital and OpEx using existing towers, thanks to our completed agreements with American Tower and Crown Castle. And we're not slowing down.\nWe continue to extend our year's long 5G lead on the competition, and independent network experts continue to recognize this. More than 20 reports from third-party testing firms in the last year confirmed T-Mobile is top in 5G speed and coverage. In Ookla's latest testing, T-Mobile delivered a clean suite of every category. And we're not just talking about individual 5G category wins like speed and availability. This is important. T-Mobile also won for overall network performance. meaning customers have a winning experience on the T-Mobile network. Period. OpenSignal's new report published last week stated that T-Mobile customers enjoy the fastest 5G speeds and can connect to 5G more often and in more places than anyone else. And the gap has only gotten wider as we keep increasing our speeds and reach. Meanwhile, AT&T somehow managed to see their 5G speeds get slower year-over-year with an LTE like 49 megabits per second.\nOkay. Let's talk about our industry-leading growth. Last year, we posted the best growth in our company's history. Across the entire span of our years' long Un-carrier journey, our best postpaid net add growth ever was in 2021. Our Magenta brand momentum is just incredible. And we added 1.2 million postpaid account net adds, doubling 2020's adds, the highest reported in the industry yet again. This measure of total billing relationships is the best barometer of winning the switching decisions in the industry, something we're famous for as the Un-carrier. And our highest-ever postpaid net adds were 5.5 million, leading the industry for the seventh consecutive year and exceeding the guidance that we raised again just last quarter. And our 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds were up 32% from last year, even during our accelerated Sprint customer integration.\nThanks to the strength of our Magenta brand, we're delivering at best-ever levels. Our Magenta postpaid phone churn in 2021 was the lowest in the industry for the second year in a row.\nWe exited the year with great momentum as well. In Q4, we not only had the highest phone gross adds in the industry, but also the highest in our history. This last quarter, interesting fact, our Magenta postpaid porting ratio was above 1.5x in Q4, and we're seeing those ratios trend even higher against AT&T and Verizon so far in Q1, while seeing our overall phone churn so far in Q1 moved down seasonally just as expected. And to put this underlying momentum into perspective, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q4 would have been closer to 1.4 million and would represent the highest quarterly postpaid phone net adds in our history.\nAnd I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where T-Mobile was the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry in Q4. Let me say that again. In Q4, T-Mobile, and not Comcast, not Charter or AT&T or Verizon, posted the most broadband net adds in the industry, and we're just getting started.\nAnd mobile customers are taking our Magenta MAX plan in record numbers with over 55% of new customers choosing our best plan. This wasn't part of our playbook before and is now a tailwind as our continuously improving network perception and competitive device offers are enticing customers right to the top of our rate card. And there's still a huge potential upside here as fewer than 15% of our postpaid phone customers are on Magenta MAX or equivalent plans.\nThis affects ARPU and ARPA. When we shared our plan with you at Analyst Day last year, we assumed postpaid phone ARPU would decline 1% every year through 2023, consistent with our historical trends and any benefit from the Magenta MAX would be upside to the plan. Well, you're already seeing that upside as we just delivered flat ARPU, actually up $0.01 in 2021.\nAnd not to steal Peter's thunder, but on the strength of this trend, we now see postpaid phone ARPU being flat to slightly up in 2022 for the first time ever. In addition, we've seen our prime mix of credit apps increase year-over-year every quarter in 2021, showing that our network and brand is consistently attracting some of the industry's best customers.\nWe're off to a great start, bringing the same winning formula to smaller markets and rural areas. This is 40% of the country where we haven't meaningfully played before. We're growing our presence here as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. In just 1 year, our share has grown from approximately 13% to roughly 15%. Our share of port-ins in smaller markets and rural areas has increased multiple percentage points year-over-year, and these markets accounted for more than 1/3 of our new accounts.\nThis is one place our network leadership is beginning to shine. We're already the only 5G game in town for many of these communities. Our extended range 5G provides speeds more than double the average LTE and reaches nearly 5x more geographic coverage than Verizon's 5G. And we're rapidly rolling out our Ultra Capacity 5G to more of these communities at an unprecedented clip, expanding our mid-band 5G coverage to 5x the land area that we cover today by the end of next year as we move from 210 million people covered to over 300 million exiting 2023.\nMeanwhile, AT&T and Verizon have finally started rolling out mid-band 5G and hope to soon be where we were almost 2 years ago. I'll say it again. We're 2 years ahead of AT&T and Verizon in 5G and 2 years from now will still be 2 years ahead.\nT-Mobile for Business had another great year as enterprise and government customers continue to do hands-on testing and when they do, they see the strength of our network. This differentiation on the network experience is delivering win share well above our market share. Just to put that in perspective, we're already, today, at a win share in enterprise and government that would get us to our targeted 20% market share by 2025, that's if we just hold our win share at current levels. And we've still got room to run.\nWe're in many ways just beginning the expansion of our solutions and capabilities. Last week, others said they were still in proof-of-concept for advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks that they hope to commercialize at some point in the future. At T-Mobile, we already have commercial revenue-generating agreements for advanced 5G solutions with multiple large corporations, including the federal government and a very large logistics company. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our ever-expanding 5G network lead.\nAnd let me just go back and touch just a little bit more on high-speed Internet. At the beginning of 2021, we were actually still in pilot. While we closed out the year with 646,000 customers, far exceeding our 500,000 target, it's abundantly clear that customers are loving the network performance and the simplicity of this 5G-based product. And with roughly 40% of high-speed Internet customers being new to T-Mobile, it creates another front door to fuel our mobile growth.\nWe're excited about the revenue and margin contribution potential of this business as we ramp up further this year and next as our planned network capacity really hits its pace. T-Mobile 5G home Internet is ready for its prime time moment. And I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by how mainstream this product really is with our unique 5G network capacity to back it up.\nOkay. Let's touch on our progress on our accelerated merger integration. While our Magenta business is firing on all cylinders, we're also successfully powering through the transition of the higher-churning Sprint customers faster than planned.\nAt our Analyst Day last year, we laid out our post-merger plan to accelerate our integration, bringing many of our biggest milestones forward by a year or more. The Sprint customer network migration is an essential part of this integration. At the end of 2021, 64% of Sprint customers have been migrated onto the T-Mobile network, well ahead of the 60% target that we laid out back at Analyst Day. This is impressive in 1 year when you consider that less than 10% were migrated at the end of 2020. As we've previously said, we expect the billing migration to be relatively seamless to the customer as we begin to ramp up this final part of the integration over the course of 2022 and into the first half of 2023.\nAs we enter the home stretch in '22 for many of our Sprint customer integration initiatives, we believe that Q4 of '21 was the high watermark for churn in terms of our overall postpaid phone churn during the integration. Having seen the integration results so far, we're now confident that churn will improve because we've seen the performance of a now material cohort of migrations.\nAs customers migrate to fully compatible devices anchored on the T-Mobile network and have a new EIP instead of leasing, they show churn rates similar to our Magenta customers. A sizable minority of Sprint customers have now hit these milestones. Completing these upgrades and migrations won't happen overnight, but the bottom line is simple. While others are temporarily padding their net adds from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short lived, which will create a growth tailwind for us, as you saw from our underlying Magenta performance while simultaneously creating a corresponding headwind for them. And we like those kinds of trends.\nOkay. Finally, before I wrap up, I do want to touch on our accomplishments as a leading corporate citizen in our industry. We not only set and exceeded our bold business and financial goals in '21, we also stayed true to our commitments to use our new network, scale and resources for good, building a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for all of our stakeholders.\nT-Mobile was the first telecom to commit to sourcing 100% of our total electricity usage with renewable energy. And we're proud to announce this week that we're the first to achieve that goal, just another example of where we're leading the industry.\nWe also further extended our leadership position in helping to bridge the digital divide. We're removing economic and geographic barriers in multiple ways. Our centerpiece is Project 10Million, which has already connected 3.2 million students with free or subsidized service. And we're expanding our high-speed Internet availability to millions of rural households, providing an important new connectivity option right where it's needed most. We also have an active participation in the government's affordable connectivity program through Metro by T-Mobile and Assurance Wireless, providing lower cost subsidized connectivity for many at a time when it's needed most.\nOkay. So let me sum it up. 2021 was our best year ever, and that's just because '22 hasn't happened yet. Our positioning to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value is working while we also rushed to successfully expand into big underpenetrated segments. We saw strong ongoing growth ahead. We see it ahead in 2022 with a strategy that is really resonating with customers.\nOur network excellence has unlocked unprecedented growth for our Magenta brand, allowing us to move upmarket in urban and suburban areas with prime consumers and with enterprises and government. And at the same time, we've expanded our reach into smaller markets and rural areas and new product categories like high-speed Internet. We delivered big milestones in each of these areas in 2021 that really demonstrate our growth thesis with results. That customer growth helped to deliver industry-leading service revenue growth, and combined with our accelerated execution on our merger synergies, has enabled us to nearly double our free cash flow year-over-year in 2021.\nOnly T-Mobile has this unique recipe with permission to win and room to run across multiple paths to unlock the massive shareholder value potential of this business.\nI'm incredibly excited to carry our momentum into 2022. This is a huge year, and there's no team I'd rather tackle it with.\nSo Peter, over to you.\n\nPeter Osvaldik\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our strong results in 2021 highlighted our unique ability to leverage our 5G network to execute our exciting growth initiatives and accelerate the merger integration. Let's start by talking about growth.\nWe achieved our highest postpaid accounts and customer growth ever in 2021, which resulted in the best service revenue growth in company history and in the industry. We delivered strong ARPA and ARPU trends throughout 2021 with postpaid ARPA up nearly 2% from a year ago, consistent with our accounts and ARPA growth strategy we have shared with you. This postpaid ARPA growth is driven by both customer growth across both postpaid phones, including the success of our Magenta MAX offering and value-accretive postpaid other connections.\nWe realized approximately $3.8 billion in synergies in 2021, nearly tripling year-over-year, with around $2.8 billion in P&L savings, which funded our growth initiatives and network build and roughly $1 billion in avoided costs. Through our higher service revenues and merger synergies, we reached record high core adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our recently raised guidance. Our growth in synergies have also unlocked rapid free cash flow expansion, which nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.6 billion in 2021 and it's just the beginning of our unique journey to deliver significant shareholder value.\nSo let's talk about how our great execution and investments in 2021 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2022. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue the accelerated Sprint customer migration. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones and continued growth in high-speed Internet. This net adds guidance does not include an expected small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint network, which will be treated as a base adjustment at the end of Q1 for CDMA and the end of Q2 for LTE. The anticipated small impact of these adjustments is fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.\nSo we expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $25.6 billion and $26.1 billion, up approximately 10% at the midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies. And this excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off to (inaudible) leasing.\nOur merger synergies are expected to further ramp to $5 billion to $5.3 billion in 2022, primarily as we unlock more network savings, particularly as we get into the second half of the year. Merger-related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. These costs will peak this year as we laid out at Analyst Day, and we expect roughly 1/3 of the total to occur in Q1 and another 1/3 in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year. We expect cash CapEx to be between $13 billion and $13.5 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration while also accelerating additional components of our build plan in order to capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer experience.\nIt is important to reiterate that our overall network capital budget remains unchanged. This acceleration further strengthens our competitive advantage by continuing the unprecedented pace of deployment, which unlocks the differentiated growth and significant cash flow generation potential of this business. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.6 billion. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization.\nWe expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26% as 2021 included significant onetime benefits. And finally, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up again in 2022 as we execute on our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships.\nAs Mike mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in 2022, driven by continued customer adoption of Magenta MAX. Altogether, we expect 2022 to be a year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. Our unique opportunity to unlock significant expansion in free cash flow is what we find so exciting and look forward to building on our momentum this year.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Jud Henry for Q&A. Jud?\n\nJud Henry\n\nSVP of IR, T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Peter. Let's get to your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nWe'll start with the question on the phone.",

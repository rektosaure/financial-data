Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Vertex delivered strong performance across the board in Q3 with $3.08 billion in revenue, reflecting double-digit growth versus Q3 2024. As we continue to extend our leadership in CF, we're also diversifying our revenue base by product and by geography with the growing global momentum of CASGEVY and the broad uptake JOURNAVX and acute pain across a wide range of prescribers pain types and settings of care, Concurrently, we are forward planning for the fourth vertical of Vertex's growth. centered on renal diseases and povetacicept in multiple indications, starting with Pove in immunoglobulin A nephropathy or IgAN. Moving to the pipeline and starting with CF. Our long-standing goals in CF have been threefold: one, bring forward a medicine that can treat CF patients who make some amount of CFTR protein. Two, bring forward a medicine that restores CFTR function to normal levels as measured by sweat chloride and to do so from as early in life as possible. So patients have the potential to live a long and healthy life like people who carry just one CF [ allele ]; and three, bring forward a medicine for the last 5% of CF patients who do not make any CFTR protein at all. .\nThanks, Susie.

First, ALYFTREK treats more mutations than TRIKAFTA. The number of patients newly eligible for CFTR modulator that treats the underlying cause of their disease is approximately 400 more patients in the U.S. and approximately 4,000 more patients in the EU than TRIKAFTA. In total, 95% of all patients are eligible or will be eligible for ALYFTREK as we make our way to lower age groups. Second, ALYFTREK, which launched in the U.S. late last year and is launching in Europe now has seen a strong response from patients and physicians who are excited for a once-daily medicine that can bring sweat chloride levels down in patients ages 6 plus to the lowest levels achieved of any CFTR modulator in this age group, 2 additional points to make on sweat chloride. We recently completed the pivotal study for TRIKAFTA for the 1- to 2-year patient population and the results are remarkable. The study's primary endpoint was safety and the data were consistent with the established safety profile of this medicine.\nWe are making progress on all 3 fronts.

We recently completed the pivotal study for TRIKAFTA for the 1- to 2-year patient population and the results are remarkable. The study's primary endpoint was safety and the data were consistent with the established safety profile of this medicine.\nThe secondary endpoint was reduction in sweat chloride. The baseline sweat chloride was about 100 millimoles per liter, and over the course of the 24-week study, there was a mean reduction of more than 70 millimoles per liter from baseline through week 24. Furthermore, nearly 70% of patients in the study achieved levels of sweat chloride below the 30 millimole per liter threshold the level considered normal. This magnitude of sweat chloride improvement is unprecedented, and the largest reduction we have seen with any CFTR modulator in any population to date. We are on track to make global regulatory submissions for TRIKAFTA in this population of 1 to 2 year olds in the first half of 2026. Additionally, as we serially innovate, we continue to develop new CFTR regimens with the aim of reaching our long-standing objective of bringing the majority of patients of any age with CF to normal levels of sweat chloride. As I just discussed with the TRIKAFTA 1- to 2-year-old study, we are already there in our youngest patients. And in our ALYFTREK Phase III study of 6-11 year-olds, more than 50% of patients got to normal levels of sweat chloride VX-828, our NextGen 3.0 CFTR corrector is the most efficacious we have ever studied in vitro to enter the clinic.\nThe secondary endpoint was reduction in sweat chloride.

And third, regarding our final goal, VX-522, which we're developing for the 5,000 or so patients who cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators, we have resumed enrollment and dosing in the MAD portion of that Phase I/II study. Moving then to pain. In acute pain, during the quarter, we completed enrollment in 2 Phase IV trials evaluating JOURNAVX initiated preoperatively and as part of multimodal approaches to acute pain management. The interim analysis for one study will be shared at a medical conference later this week, and top line results for JOURNAVX show safety and efficacy, consistent with the pivotal program. Accompanied by substantial reductions in opioid use following aesthetic or reconstructive procedures with approximately 90% of participants being opioid-free compared to less than 10% after similar procedures per the literature. In neuropathic pain, the first DPN Phase III study is well underway, and we have completed work that sets up the initiation of the second DPN Phase III study later this month. Transitioning now to the kidney portfolio. Renal Medicine is experiencing a renaissance in drug development, and Vertex seeks to be a leader in the field. With our differentiated R&D approach, grounded in causal human biology, validated targets and biomarkers that translate, we have a broad portfolio of innovative therapies with transformative potential for patients with serious kidney diseases.\nI am pleased to share we have now initiated the CF cohort in the VX-828 study.

VX-407 for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, or ADPKD, and inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD pove for IgAN and pove for primary membranous nephropathy. Starting with VX-407 ADPKD, where the Phase II proof-of-concept study was initiated earlier this quarter. Recall, there are approximately 300,000 patients with ADPKD in the U.S. and Europe. These patients have limited treatment options and no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of this disease. We believe that up to 10% of patients with ADPKD may be eligible for treatment with VX-407, a first-in-class small molecule protein folding corrector. VX-407 is designed to target the root cause of ADPKD by restoring PC1 protein function. This Phase II proof-of-concept study is a single-arm trial of 24 patients that evaluates the effect of VX-407 on height adjusted total kidney volume.\nOur clinical pipeline has first-in-class or best-in-class assets for 4 kidney diseases. 3 of which are already in or approaching pivotal development.

Enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the amplitude pivotal study has completed. The patients in this cohort are now being treated for 48 weeks, after which we will conduct the interim analysis. And if positive, we will be poised to submit for potential accelerated approval in the U.S. Additionally, we are running the amplified study, which is a Phase II proof-of-concept study of inaxaplin in patients with AMKD with moderate proteinuria or patients with AMKD and diabetes populations not being studied in the amplitude trial. AMPLIFIED is on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year.\nThe second kidney program to highlight is inaxaplin for primary AMKD, a disease that affects 150,000 patients in the U.S. and EU.

The lead and first indication for pove is IgAN, a disease impacting more than 300,000 diagnosed patients in the U.S. and Europe and over 1 million patients globally. There are 4 points to highlight in this program. First, we completed enrollment of the interim analysis cohort of the RAINIER Phase III trial earlier this year. Second, the FDA has granted pove breakthrough therapy designation and and rolling review for our BLA. Third, we have completed the studies to support the launch of pove for at-home self-administration with a subcutaneous auto-injector. Lastly, the new news, I'm very pleased to share tonight is that we have completed full enrollment in the RAINIER Phase III trial. The trial enrolled approximately 600 patients in approximately 15 months, the fastest of any contemporary Phase III study in IgAN and is a testament to the significant opportunity ahead for POI Here's the outlook when you put these 4 major milestones together with the rolling review that the FDA is granted, we will begin our submission for potential accelerated approval before the end of this year.\nNow turning to povetacicept.

Next, and consistent with this pipeline and product potential, we are pleased to have initiated the pivotal study for the second potential renal indication for pove in primary membranous nephropathy. There are approximately 150,000 patients with membranous nephropathy in the U.S. and Europe and nearly 500,000 globally. Today, there are no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of this disease, leaving a significant patient population with high unmet need. Pove was recently granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in membranous nephropathy and our Phase II/III adaptive study [ OLYMPUS ], is now underway. One final note in R&D regarding Zimislecel in type 1 diabetes. While we have completed enrollment in the pivotal trial for T1D, we have temporarily postponed completion of dosing while we work through an internal manufacturing analysis.\nOnce the interim analysis cohort completes 36 weeks of treatment, assuming the results are positive, we will complete our BLA submission for potential accelerated approval in the U.S. in the first half of 2026. we have used a priority review voucher, and thus, we have certainty that pove's BLA in the IgAN indication will receive an expedited priority review in the U.S. That is a 6-month review versus a traditional 10-month review.

Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Reshma. I will focus my comments tonight on the CF franchise, global launches of ALYFTREK and CASGEVY the U.S. launch of JOURNAVX and commercial planning for our potential launches in 4 serious kidney diseases, the first of which will be Pove in IgAN, Beginning with CF, our CF franchise delivered strong double-digit growth this quarter as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients taking our CFTR modulators. This reflects the ongoing launch of the ALYFTREK, progress with younger patients and patients with rare mutations, enhanced survival benefits of our therapies and expansion into new geographies, such as Brazil and Turkey. Focusing on ALYFTREK, our fifth therapy approved to treat the underlying cause of CF. We believe ALYFTREK is the best CFTR modulator available for eligible patients given that when compared to standard of care TRIKAFTA, ALYFTREK provides further improvements in CFTR function as measured by sweat chloride is indicated for additional rare mutations and offers the convenience of once-daily dosing. The U.S. launch of ALYFTREK is progressing well across all patient groups. We have seen particularly rapid uptake in those patients who are naive to CFTR modulators and the vast majority of previously untreated patients in the U.S. have now been initiated on the ALYFTREK.\nThanks very much, Reshma.

We have seen particularly rapid uptake in those patients who are naive to CFTR modulators and the vast majority of previously untreated patients in the U.S. have now been initiated on the ALYFTREK.\nWe also see continued uptake by those patients who have previously discontinued one of our other CFTR modulators. Lastly, the pace of transition patients primarily those switching from TRIKAFTA remains steady and represents the majority of patients on ALYFTREK in the quarter. Outside the U.S., the early launch of ALYFTREK is off to a strong start in multiple European countries where patients have reimbursed access England, Ireland, Germany and Denmark. And the feedback has been very positive, both in terms of the clinical profile and once daily dosing. And as Reshma mentioned, there are nearly 10x as many newly eligible patients in Europe with rare mutations for TRIKAFTA and ALYFTREK than in the U.S. and no additional liver monitoring requirements. Overall, we are pleased with the response to ALYFTREK and continue to expect that the majority of patients around the globe will transition to ALYFTREK over time given its multiple benefits.\nWe also see continued uptake by those patients who have previously discontinued one of our other CFTR modulators.

The momentum continues to build as we enter the last few months of 2025. As a result, we have a clear line of sight to over $100 million in CASGEVY revenue this year and significant growth in 2026. Importantly, we have seen continued progress in securing access to CASGEVY around the world, with the notable recent addition of reimbursement in Italy for TDT and SCD. Italy has the second largest population in the world of TDT patients at approximately 5,000 patients, about half of whom are eligible for CASGEVY. As further evidence of CASGEVY building momentum across all 3 regions, the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, I'm pleased to report that since launch and through the end of quarter 3, 2025 nearly 300 patients have been referred by their physicians to an ATC to initiate the treatment process.\nMoving to CASGEVY, our transformative onetime treatment for patients with severe sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

This includes 110 in the first 9 months of 2025, double our full year 2024 total. And a total of 39 patients have received their infusions of CASGEVY edited cells, including 10 patients in the third quarter of 2025. We see continued growth in ATC's onboarding and initiating patients in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East as the treatment teams become more familiar with the process. Through the end of September, 25 ATCs had initiated more than 5 patients and at least one ATC in each of the 3 regions had initiated 20 or more patients. Given the very well understood duration of the treatment journey and the fact that we now have significant numbers of patients at every stage in the process, CASGEVY has a strong outlook, and we are excited to serve the growing numbers of patients through the end of this year into 2026 and beyond.\nMore than 160 patients now have had their first cell collection.

We continue to see a very positive reaction to this novel non-opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. As a reminder, our goals in 2025 were firstly secure broad payer coverage. Secondly, ensure hospital and health system access through P&T reviews and formulary adoption. And thirdly, drive broad usage of generics across a range of physician and pain types with a seamless experience for physicians and patients alike. We are executing well on all fronts, and I'll now provide some details. We continue to make good progress with payers. As of mid-October, across commercial and government payers, over 170 million lives of reimbursed access to generics, up from the [ 150 million ] we discussed on our Q2 call. With commercial payers, our negotiations continue to progress favorably. We have formal coverage under 2 of the 3 large national PBMs and are working to add the third. In Medicare, we continue to engage with plans to secure coverage.\nNow shifting to the launch of generics in moderate to severe acute pain.

In Medicare, we continue to engage with plans to secure coverage.\nAnd for Medicaid patients through mid-October, we now have a total of 19 states, up from 16 last quarter that are providing access to generics without prior authorization or step edit requirements. We continue to expect that coverage across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid payers will expand through the balance of 2025 and into 2026. Note that even after national payers grant formal coverage for genomics, it can take time to ensure that all lives are covered in their downstream plans. Therefore, we plan to extend our patient support program, or PSP, into 2026 to ensure that if a physician makes the decision to prescribe genetics for their patient with acute pain, the patient will receive the medicine. Recall the PSP only kicks in for those patients without coverage or with highly restricted coverage. So for patient's plan reimburses genetics, the PSP program is not triggered. Secondly, we're making excellent progress with P&T committees at the approximately 150 health care systems and 2,000 hospitals we're targeting, more than 750 hospitals and approximately 90 of the 150 targeted large health care systems have now added genetics to their formularies, protocols or order sets.\nAnd for Medicaid patients through mid-October, we now have a total of 19 states, up from 16 last quarter that are providing access to generics without prior authorization or step edit requirements. We continue to expect that coverage across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid payers will expand through the balance of 2025 and into 2026. Note that even after national payers grant formal coverage for genomics, it can take time to ensure that all lives are covered in their downstream plans.

They're using JOURNAVX in a wide range of pain settings, including surgical and nonsurgical procedures, such as joint replacement and repair, shoulder surgeries, fractures and sprains and dental procedures. In hospital systems and clinics that have adopted JOURNAVX, we have received impressive feedback from physicians in terms of very significantly reduced or eliminated opioid usage, consistent with the Phase I study results Reshma mentioned earlier. Reports from patients also continue to be very positive in terms of how well JOURNAVX manage their pain in addition to being well tolerated. We also continue to see that JOURNAVX is promotionally responsive to our field representative calls as well as our digital engagement with physicians. There is a clear correlation between frequency of calls and depth of prescription writing by physicians. For these reasons, and as we discussed last quarter, we're planning to add 150 additional representatives in the first quarter of 2026, which will enable us to increase our frequency of calls with existing prescribers and expand our coverage to additional physicians.\nThirdly, we continue to see broad adoption of genetics by a wide range of physicians, including orthopedic surgeons, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, pain specialists and dentists.

Finally, as evidence of the growing reception in the marketplace, there have now been more than 300,000 prescriptions filled for JOURNAVX across the retail and hospital settings as of mid-October. We continue to have high confidence that there is a significant unmet need for an effective non-opioid option to treat moderate to severe acute pain, and we're in the early days of creating another multibillion-dollar franchise for Vertex.\nAnd to raise awareness of JOURNAVX among consumers, we have a wide range of communication initiatives ongoing, including a partnership with basketball Superstar, Jason Tatum as he shares his genetic treatment journey experience post is [ Achilles ] injury during the playoffs last season.

We expect that our renal franchise will become a significant growth driver and value generator for Vertex over the next several years. I'll focus my comments this evening on our first step in that direction, Pove in IgAN. We believe that pove V offers a unique combination of attributes with a compelling clinical and patient profile. Firstly, pove is a fusion protein specifically engineered for better tissue penetration and to deliver optimized, targeted dual inhibition of the BAFF and APRIL cytokines. In the Ruby III clinical data we've seen to date, pove delivers substantial reductions in [ GDI GA1 ], hematuria and proteinuria. Secondly, among the APRIL only or dual BAFF APRIL inhibitors, pove has the most convenient dosing and administration for patients. Every 4 weeks at home administration via a subcutaneous auto-injector and the lowest dosage volume of less than 0.5 milliliters. And thirdly, pove is the only dual BAFF APRIL inhibitor in pivotal trials for multiple serious kidney diseases, IgAN and PMN. We believe pove has a superior mechanism of action, a superior clinical profile and will deliver a superior patient experience. In short, we believe pove holds best-in-class potential. We're excited to build out our renal franchise and prepare for commercialization in our fifth disease area with pove as a potential best-in-class treatment for IgAN.\nI'll close with some comments on our commercial planning for our potential launches in renal medicine, where we have begun the build-out of our commercialization team.

Wagner\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Duncan. Vertex's Q3 2025 double-digit revenue growth demonstrates our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Third quarter 2025 total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $3.08 billion. U.S. revenue growth of 15% year-over-year was driven in CF by ongoing patient demand and favorable net pricing versus prior year. As well as contributions from ALYFTREK, CASGEVY and JOURNAVX. Revenue outside the U.S. grew 4% year-on-year, including mid-single-digit CF growth and a contribution from CASGEVY. Included in Q3, '25 total global revenue and the regional growth rates was $17 million of CASGEVY revenue and $20 million from JOURNAVX. Third quarter 2025 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.28 billion compared to $1.08 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 19% year-on-year, driven primarily by the continued advancement of our broad later-stage pipeline, including the acceleration of pove development programs as well as the build-out of commercial capabilities in pain. Acquired IP R&D expenses were $55 million compared to $15 million in the third quarter of 2024. Third quarter 2025 non-GAAP operating income was $1.38 billion compared to $1.31 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Third quarter 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.6%, including benefits from R&D tax credits as a result of last year's Alpine acquisition. Third quarter 2025 non-GAAP net income was $1.24 billion compared to $1.14 billion in Q3 of '24. Third quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.80, an increase of 10% compared to $4.38 in the third quarter of 2024.\nWe ended the quarter with $12 billion in cash and investments after deploying approximately $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 2.7 million shares in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have spent over $1.9 billion to repurchase approximately 4.5 million shares. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged, innovation and growth fueled by investments, both internal and external, with a second priority of share repurchases. Now switching to guidance. With only one quarter remaining in 2025, we are updating our financial guidance for revenue, operating expenses and taxes. We now expect 2025 total revenue to be in a range of $11.9 billion to $12 billion versus prior guidance of $11.85 billion to $12 billion, representing growth of approximately 8% to 9% for the full year at current exchange rates. This outlook reflects our expectation for continued growth from our portfolio of CF medicines, including the ongoing launch of ALYFTREK in the U.S. and recent launches in Europe. As Duncan mentioned, full year revenue guidance also includes over $100 million of CASGEVY revenue as we treat more patients in geographies where we have secured regulatory approval and reimbursement. In addition, guidance reflects further contribution from JOURNAVX in the fourth quarter due to growing prescription volumes. We are also refining guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses and now expect operating expenses of approximately $5 billion to $5.1 billion versus prior guidance of $4.9 billion to $5 billion for the full year.\nThis is primarily due to the acceleration in pove development programs across multiple indications and increased investment in commercial and marketing activities to support the launch of JOURNAVX. There is no change to our estimate of approximately $100 million in projected IPR&D charges for the full year, including the recently announced collaboration with in [indiscernible] We continue to expect an immaterial cost impact from tariffs in 2025 based on what we know today due to our significant U.S. presence and our geographically diverse supply chain. Of course, given the dynamic nature of the tariff situation, including the potential for sector-specific tariffs, this outlook is subject to change.\nAnd finally, we are lowering our expected full year 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance from a range of 20.5% to 21.5% to a revised range of 17% to 18% and to incorporate several onetime tax benefits. These benefits include those recognized in Q3 from Alpine related R&D tax credits as well as anticipated recognition in Q4 '25 of previously deferred tax benefits.\nIn closing, Vertex yet again delivered strong results in Q3 '25, growing and diversifying our revenue with the launch of 2 new products in the U.S., ALYFTREK and JOURNAVX, the launch of ALYFTREK in Europe and the continued global launch of CASGEVY. We also made significant pipeline progress across the portfolio in mid- and late-stage clinical development, including pove's pipeline and a product potential and continued advancement. These and other anticipated milestones of continued progress in multiple disease areas are detailed on Slide 17. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls.\nI'll now ask Susie to begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Susie Lisa. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening, all. My name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2025 financial results conference call. On tonight's call making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Duncan McKechnie, Chief Commercial Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Operating and Financial Officer.\nWe recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed medicines for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and moderate to severe acute pain, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis.\nI will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. As anticipated, momentum accelerated and we executed with very strong performance across the board, growing and diversifying revenue with multiple new product launches, driving advancement of programs in pivotal development and progressing the earlier stage R&D pipeline. We continue to reach more patients with more products and delivered $2.96 billion in revenue in the second quarter, representing 12% growth versus Q2 2024. We remain sharply focused on commercialization across multiple disease areas and expansion of our patient reach.\nWe are pleased with the first 6 months of launch performance as well as physician and patient feedback on both ALYFTREK in CF and JOURNAVX in acute pain as well as the building global momentum for CASGEVY, our gene-edited therapy for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. In addition to this commercialization focus, research and clinical progress remain paramount. And to that end, we continue to rapidly advance the 4 programs in pivotal development and are working with urgency to begin our fifth and primary membranous nephropathy.\nBefore I cover R&D highlights for the quarter, I would like to acknowledge our CSO David Altshuler's retirement a year from now and the planned CSO transition to Mark Bunnage, our current SVP and Global Head of Research. David will be retiring from Vertex effective August 1, 2026, after an incredible 13-year career with the company. David initially joined Vertex as a member of the Board of Directors in 2012 and became Chief Scientific Officer in 2015.\nDuring David's tenure, multiple CF medicines have advanced from research through commercialization, including ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO, TRIKAFTA and ALYFTREK. Our disease sandbox has broadened, and we successfully advanced the scientific breakthroughs that became CASGEVY and JOURNAVX. In an industry with notoriously low R&D success rates, David's teams delivered remarkable achievements year after year.\nDavid is a world-renowned physician scientist who is known for his creative and critical thinking, penchant for debate and commitment to building teams. On a more personal level, I know him as a deeply passionate Vertexian, dedicated physician and valued member of the executive team.\nAs mentioned in our earnings release, as part of this planned transition, I am delighted to announce that Mark Bunnage will assume the role of EVP and Chief Scientific Officer effective February 1, 2026, after which David will work with Mark to ensure a smooth transition. Mark joined Vertex and has worked alongside David since 2016. Since that time, Mark has held increasing senior leadership roles across research, starting as SVP site head Boston Research and most recently as SVP, Head of Global Research, overseeing all 5 of Vertex's research sites.\nUnder Mark's leadership, we advanced many molecules to the clinic, including CASGEVY and JOURNAVX, [ enaxiplin ] for AMKD, VX-828 for CF, VX-670 for DM1 and VX-407 for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Mark was also intimately involved in the diligence that led to the Alpine acquisition, which brought povetacicept to Vertex. I look forward to celebrating David's retirement and welcoming Mark as CSO when the time gets closer.\nReturning then to R&D highlights. I'll limit my comments to the pipeline programs with the most significant new information to share, specifically CF, pain, type 1 diabetes and the renal programs. Starting with CF. As of July, we've gained approval for ALYFTREK in the U.S., U.K., EU and Canada. We've also secured reimbursement for ALYFTREK in England and will add Ireland shortly. Patients in Germany and Denmark already have reimbursed access due to existing agreements and provisions, and across other EU member nations and Canada, we're working with reimbursement bodies to secure access for eligible patients as quickly as possible.\nAs we continue to expand our existing CFTR modulator portfolio to younger age groups, we also continue to develop new CFTR regimens with the aim of reaching our long-standing objective of bringing most, if not all, people with CF to normal levels of CFTR function. Our Next-Gen 3.0 or NG 3.0 regimen is next on deck. The backbone of the NG 3.0 combination is VX-828, the most efficacious CFTR corrector that we have ever studied in vitro and brought to the clinic. We are nearing completion of the healthy volunteer study, and we remain on track to initiate a cohort of people with CF with the VX-828 regimen before the end of this year.\nFinally, in CF, on VX-522, I am pleased to note that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee has completed its review and has endorsed restarting the trial. We're now in the process of working to resume dosing in the MAD portion of the Phase I/II for the 5,000 or so patients who cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators and expect to do so in the near term.\nNow shifting to pain. First, in peripheral neuropathic pain or PNP, we had a productive end of Phase II meeting with the FDA on our PNP program. While a broad PNP label remains our goal, at this time, the FDA does not see a path to a broad indication. As such, we will not be initiating an LSR trial at present. Instead, in light of the discussions and clear agreement with the FDA regarding approval requirements for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN, we will begin a second DPN Phase III study shortly in order to secure DPN as our first PNP indication for suzetrigine. Recall, we have breakthrough therapy designation for the DPN indication. Also note that our first Phase III study of suzetrigine in DPN is already well underway. And with the near-term initiation of the second DPN study, our goal is to complete enrollment of both of these trials by the end of 2026. We look forward to working with the agency to secure DPN as our first PNP indication to expand the indication over time and to continue to discuss a potential pathway to a broad PNP label.\nTurning now to acute pain and VX-993, another NaV1.8 inhibitor. This afternoon, we shared top line results from the Phase II trial of this molecule in the post bunionectomy setting. To recap, as part of our serial innovation strategy, we developed VX-993 with 3 main goals: first, to have an IV option; second, to provide additional NaV1.8 inhibitor candidates for potential use as co-formulation with future NaV1.7 inhibitors. And third, to further refine dose-response relationships, including whether higher clinical exposure might result in greater clinical efficacy. Focusing on this last point of efficacy based on the predicted clinical potency and exposure of 993, we powered the Phase II trial with the goal of detecting a treatment effect higher than previously achieved. This Phase II trial included a placebo group, 3 VX-993 dosage arms and a hydrocodone reference arm. The primary endpoint was SPID48, compared to placebo.\nThe results showed that VX-993 was safe and well tolerated with no related SAEs and an overall profile consistent with the placebo arm. The placebo effect was well controlled, and desired 993 exposures were achieved with adequate separation between doses. On efficacy, VX-993 did not meet the primary endpoint and did not show statistical significance at the 0.05 level. This SPID48 treatment effect was similar at both the mid and high doses and both were numerically better versus placebo. The outcome of this study, combined with the totality of evidence from our preclinical models and previous NaV1.8 inhibitor clinical studies in acute pain suggest we are at the high end of the NaV1.8 dose response curve for acute pain in the post bunionectomy setting. As such, we do not plan to advance VX-993 as monotherapy in acute pain because we do not expect that it will be superior to our NaV1.8 inhibitors.\nWe do plan to complete the ongoing VX-993 study of DPN to further define the exposure response, relationship and maximal efficacy of NaV1.8 inhibitors in this chronic pain indication. To close out on pain, a quick word on our NaV1.7 inhibitor program. We're very encouraged by our strong preclinical progress in this program and look forward to advancing candidates for use alone or in combination with NaV1.8 inhibitors.\nTransitioning now to type 1 diabetes. Zimislecel will soon complete enrollment in dosing of its pivotal study, positioning us for global regulatory submissions in 2026 if the data are supportive. Recall, we expect about 60,000 severe type 1 diabetic patients may potentially benefit from this first zimislecel submission. In June at the ADA meeting and concurrently in the New England Journal of Medicine, positive data for zimislecel in type 1 diabetes were presented that continue to demonstrate this cell therapy's transformative potential. All 12 patients with at least 1 year follow-up who received a full dose of zimislecel as a single infusion achieved ADA recommended target hemoglobin A1C levels less than 7%, freedom from severe hypoglycemic events during the evaluation period and greater than 70% time in range. Remarkably, 10 of the 12 patients at 12 months were insulin free, a testament to the potential transformative benefit and durability of this therapy.\nWe also continue to make preclinical progress on our approaches to [ cloak ] the same VX-880 cells from the immune system, including improved immunosuppressive regimens, gene editing to produce hyperimmune islet cells and novel immuno protection to encapsulate these cells. We look forward to updating you as these programs advance.\nFinally, a few updates on our kidney portfolio, which now has clinical stage programs in 4 diseases: IgA nephropathy, AMKD, membranous nephropathy and ADPKD, or autosomal dominant kidney disease. Starting with povetacicept, a number of autoimmune diseases are driven by uncontrolled B cells. By controlling B cells, pove is designed to restore immune balance for patients and hold the potential to have transformative benefit across multiple disease states. Pove was specifically engineered for better tissue penetration and to deliver optimized targeted dual inhibition of the BAFF and APRIL cytokines, which both play a key role in the pathogenesis of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.\nFirst up for pove is IgAN. We disclosed previously that we completed enrollment of the interim analysis cohort in the RAINIER Phase III trial. Today, we are pleased to share that we are on track to complete enrollment of the full RAINIER study by the end of this year. With regard to the interim analysis cohort, once this group completes 36 weeks of treatment, we will conduct the interim analysis and if positive, we'll file for potential accelerated approval in the U.S. in the first half of 2026.\nTo close out on IgAN, studies to support the launch of pove for at-home self-administration with a subcutaneous auto injector are also well underway. Next and consistent with this pipeline and our product potential, the second disease state where we believe pove can provide B-cell control is primary membranous nephropathy. Based on strong emerging data from the RUBY-3 study, we completed our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA and reached agreement on a Phase II/III adaptive study for traditional approval of pove versus standard of care with the primary endpoint of complete remission at 72 weeks. This Phase II/III study will begin later this year.\nAnd third, we have prioritized additional diseases in which we believe pove also holds best-in-class promise. Based on emerging data, potential patient impact, the treatment landscape and commercial opportunity, the next 2 autoimmune diseases in focus for us are generalized [ myasthenia gravis ] and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or WAHA.\nSo to summarize, our current priority disease areas are IgAN, membranous nephropathy, generalized [ myasthenia gravis ] and WAHA, and we are deprioritizing other indications at this time. Next on inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease, we remain on track to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the AMPLITUDE pivotal trial in primary AMKD this year. Of note, while we are able to enroll more adolescent patients, we've hit an important milestone in this study, where the target number of 10- to 17-year-old AMKD patients has now been achieved. After completing enrollment in the IA cohort, these patients will be followed for 48 weeks of treatment, at which point we will conduct the interim analysis. And if positive, we'll be poised to file for potential accelerated approval in the U.S.\nThe AMPLIFIED study, a Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with AMKD and comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, is also underway, and this trial is on track to complete enrollment by the end of 2025. To close on our kidney pipeline is VX-407 for ADPKD, a first-in-class molecule protein folding corrector that is designed to treat the underlying cause of ADPKD by restoring PC1 protein function, thereby reducing total kidney volume and preventing progression to kidney failure. As a reminder, there are approximately 300,000 patients with ADPKD, and there are no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of this disease.\nWe believe about 10% of patients with ADPKD may be eligible for treatment with VX-407. This quarter, we'll begin the VX-407 proof-of-concept trial, which is a 52-week single-arm study in 24 patients that will evaluate the efficacy of VX-407 as measured by height-adjusted total kidney volume.\nIn closing, Vertex has multiple Phase III programs well underway that are poised for accelerated or traditional approval. These trials have either already completed enrollment or are on track to do so in 2025. They each serve a disease with high unmet need, and they've secured multiple regulatory designations, including Fast Track, Breakthrough, Regenerative Medicine or RMAT, Prime, amongst others, all of which positions us for multiple regulatory submissions in 2026 and early 2027, with potential approvals and launches to follow. Accordingly, as we drive to achieve our R&D milestones, we're executing on the concurrent work of preparing for commercialization of these potential launches.\nWith that, I'll now turn over the call to Duncan for a commercial update.\n\nDuncan McKechnie\n\nThanks very much, Reshma. I will focus my comments tonight on the CF franchise, including the launch of ALYFTREK in the U.S., the continuing global launch of CASGEVY and the U.S. launch of JOURNAVX in moderate to severe acute pain.\nStarting with CF. Our CF franchise continues to deliver strong results as we grow the number of eligible patients taking our CFTR modulators. We continue to make progress with younger patients, patients with rare mutations and patients in new geographies. The overall market outlook is also supported by the fact that patients are living longer.\nNow turning to the U.S. launch of ALYFTREK, our fifth therapy approved to treat the underlying cause of CF. We believe ALYFTREK is the best CFTR modulator available for eligible patients. As we've discussed on prior calls, versus TRIKAFTA, ALYFTREK provides further improvements in CFTR function as measured by sweat chloride is indicated for additional mutations not covered by the TRIKAFTA label and offers the convenience of once-daily dosing.\nIn the U.S., the early launch of ALYFTREK is progressing well across all patient groups. We have seen particularly rapid uptake in those patients who are naive to CFTR modulators and thus newly eligible for ALYFTREK, as well as those who previously discontinued one of our other CFTR modulators. For patients currently on TRIKAFTA, many have been on therapy for multiple years, have experienced incredible clinical benefit, and therefore, have considerable brand loyalty. In this context, the pace of transitions is steady as these patients continue their conversations with physicians and make decisions that balance the short-term logistics of augmented liver monitoring with ALYFTREK against a lifetime of potential benefits, including greater CFTR protein function and once-daily dosing.\nOverall, we're very pleased with the reports of ALYFTREK's clinical success that physicians and patients are sharing whether they were naive to a CFTR modulator, are returning to therapy or have recently transitioned from TRIKAFTA. We continue to expect the majority of patients who are currently on CFTR modulator therapy will transition to ALYFTREK over time given its multiple benefits. We're also now in the process of launching ALYFTREK in England following our recent reimbursement agreement with NHS England as well as in Germany and Denmark.\nTransitioning to CASGEVY, our transformative onetime treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. The CASGEVY launch is building momentum, and we're pleased with the progress we're making in 2025 as well as the growth it positions us for in 2026. In quarter 2, we've seen an acceleration across the board in patient initiations, cell collections and infusions. This progress is a reflection of the foundational work initiated in 2024 to build our ATC network, expand our geographic footprint to include the Middle East and secure reimbursement for CASGEVY worldwide.\nRegarding reimbursement, 10 countries now provide access to CASGEVY, including the U.S. and several European and Middle Eastern countries. In terms of our CASGEVY launch metrics, I'm pleased to report that since launch and through the end of quarter 2, 2025. Firstly, we have met our authorized treatment center goal with more than 75 ATCs now activated globally. We are now dosing patients with sickle cell disease or TDT in multiple regions, including the Middle East, Europe and the U.S.\nAnd secondly, nearly 250 patients have been referred by their physicians to an ATC to initiate the treatment process. Approximately 115 patients have had their first cell collections, including 35 first cell collections in quarter 2, 2025. And finally, a total of 29 patients have completed their treatment journey and received their infusions of CASGEVY edited cells, including 16 patients in the second quarter of 2025.\nNow shifting to the launch of JOURNAVX in moderate to severe acute pain. JOURNAVX received FDA approval on January 30 and has been available in channel since March. We continue to see a very positive reaction to this novel non-opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. We're pleased with the rapid pace of payer coverage, P&T committee reviews, formulary adoption, breadth of usage and hospital uptake. We're also very encouraged by the broad range of positive JOURNAVX experiences reported by both physicians and patients.\nI'll detail several key elements of our ongoing launch. One, we continue to make great progress with payers, which is a testament to their appreciation for the JOURNAVX clinical profile and the importance of offering a novel non-opioid option in the treatment of acute pain. As of mid-July, across commercial and government payers, approximately 150 million lives or roughly half of all lives covered in the U.S. have reimbursed access to JOURNAVX.\nWith commercial payers, our negotiations continue to progress very favorably. We recently reached a formal coverage agreement with a second large national pharmacy benefit manager to make JOURNAVX available to their customers, representing an incremental 22 million commercial lives. As a result, we now have formal coverage from 2 of the 3 large national PBMs and anticipate adding the third before year-end. In addition, we now have national agreements in place with the 2 largest hospital group purchasing organizations to make JOURNAVX available to acute pain patients in their network member hospitals.\nIn Medicare, we continue to engage with plans to secure coverage. And for Medicaid patients, through mid-July, we added 6 state plans since our quarter 1 earnings call for a total of 16 states with legislation that ensures access is available without prior authorization or step edit requirements. We continue to expect the coverage across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid payers will continue to expand through 2025.\nTwo, we are prioritizing the P&T committees at approximately 150 health care systems and roughly 2,000 hospitals. The majority of these 2,000 hospitals ladder up to 1 of the 150 health care systems. Last quarter, we disclosed that more than 1/3 of these target health care systems had taken steps to initiate the P&T review of JOURNAVX. I'm very happy to report that over 1/3 of these priority target health care systems have now added JOURNAVX to formularies, protocols or order sets, and many more have JOURNAVX under active consideration. In addition, at the hospital level, about 500 of the 2,000 hospitals we're targeting have also added JOURNAVX to their formularies, protocols or order sets.\nThree, prescribing patterns are encouraging for the near- and long-term outlook for JOURNAVX with excellent breadth of usage to date across a wide range of inpatient and outpatient settings, pain conditions and physician specialties, in line with the broad label. Lastly, more than 110,000 prescriptions were successfully filled for JOURNAVX across the retail and hospital settings as of mid-July. We remain tremendously excited about our opportunity to transform the treatment of pain, and we'll continue to invest as we see warranted.\nGiven the rapid contracting and formulary progress we have made as well as the prescriber and patient feedback, we believe now is the time to make additional investments in our commercial activities behind JOURNAVX. This includes additional marketing activities in Q3, as well as field support as we continue to secure more access and hospital formulary wins over the coming months. We have high confidence that we are in the early days of creating another multibillion-dollar franchise for Vertex.\nTo conclude, we are well on our way to establishing a new era of commercial diversification at Vertex as we execute on multiple launches in CF, sickle cell disease, TDT and acute pain and begin the build-out for the next wave of launches in a number of disease areas with high unmet need. We look forward to bringing our transformative therapies to millions more patients and to keeping you updated on our progress.\nI'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Duncan. Vertex's Q2 2025 revenue growth accelerated as expected, and our results demonstrate our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Second quarter 2025 total revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $2.96 billion. U.S. revenue growth of 14% year-over-year was driven in CF by ongoing patient demand and favorable gross to net versus prior year and also included contributions from CASGEVY, JOURNAVX and collaboration revenue.\nAs expected, revenue outside the U.S. rebounded this quarter and was up 8% year-on-year, including healthy CF growth and a contribution from CASGEVY. Included in total revenue and the regional growth rates was $30 million of CASGEVY revenue, $12 million from JOURNAVX and $21 million of collaboration revenue.\nSecond quarter 2025 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $1.24 billion compared to $5.43 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding Alpine related acquired IPR&D, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 24% year-on-year, driven primarily by the continued advancement of our broad pipeline, including clinical trials for IgAN, pain and type 1 diabetes as well as the build-out of commercial capabilities in pain. Second quarter 2025 acquired IPR&D expenses were $2 million compared to $4.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024, which included the acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences.\nSecond quarter 2025 non-GAAP operating income was $1.33 billion compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $3.15 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Second quarter 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.4%. Second quarter 2025 net income was $1.2 billion compared to a net loss of $3.3 billion in Q2 of '24. Second quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.52 compared to a loss per share of $12.83 in the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher revenue and disciplined operating spend as well as the impact of the Alpine [ AIP R&D ] expense in the second quarter of 2024.\nWe ended the quarter with $12 billion in cash and investments after deploying approximately $395 million to repurchase more than 865,000 shares in the second quarter. In May, we announced a new $4 billion share repurchase program, building upon our existing $3 billion share repurchase program which was authorized in 2023 and had $570 million remaining as of June 30. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged: Innovation and growth fueled by investment, both internal and external, followed by share repurchases.\nNow switching to guidance. We are reiterating all elements of our financial guidance, including our 2025 total revenue guidance range of $11.85 billion to $12 billion, representing growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. This outlook reflects our expectation for continued growth from our portfolio of CF medicines, including the ongoing launch of ALYFTREK in the U.S., followed by other regions later this year. Recall that ALYFTREK carries a meaningfully lower royalty burden than TRIKAFTA and extends our composition of matter patent protection to 2039.\nRevenue guidance also includes CASGEVY revenue as we treat more patients in geographies where we have secured regulatory approval and reimbursement. Given the duration of the patient journey, we have high visibility into CASGEVY revenue. As patient initiations and cell collections continue to ramp, we expect commensurate increases in infusions. But note that because the timing of infusions is predicated on patient scheduling choices, there may be revenue variability from quarter-to-quarter.\nIn addition, guidance reflects additional revenue contribution from JOURNAVX in the second half due to gains in sustainable payer coverage. Recently announced positive coverage decisions are included in our revenue guidance. Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver another strong year of revenue growth for Vertex in 2025.\nWe are also reiterating guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses in a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion for the full year 2025, though we expect to be at the high end of this guidance range. Consistent with prior commentary, this range includes approximately $100 million in projected IPR&D charges. We will continue to invest the majority of our operating expenses into R&D given the momentum in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs, with 4 and soon to be 5 Phase III studies ongoing and multiple Phase IIs.\nIn addition, given progress with respect to reimbursement and access and the size of the opportunity for JOURNAVX, as Duncan mentioned, we are increasing our investment in marketing and commercial initiatives to support the launch in the second half of this year. We expect an immaterial cost impact from tariffs in 2025 based on what we know today due to our significant U.S. presence and our geographically diverse supply chain. Of course, given the dynamic nature of the tariff situation, including the potential for sector-specific tariffs, this outlook is subject to change.\nAnd finally, on guidance, there is no change to our expected full year 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%, which implies a higher effective tax rate in the second half of the year. We do not anticipate recent tax legislation to have a material impact on our expected effective tax rate in 2025.\nIn closing, Vertex yet again delivered strong results in Q2 '25, growing and diversifying our revenue with the launch of 2 new products in the U.S., ALYFTREK and JOURNAVX, continuing the global launch of CASGEVY and making significant pipeline progress across the portfolio. These and other anticipated milestones of continued progress in multiple disease areas are detailed on Slide 17. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. I'll now ask Susie to begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening, all. My name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2025 financial results conference call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer; and Duncan McKechnie, SVP North America Commercial Operations and come July 1, Chief Commercial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed medicines for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia and moderate to severe acute pain, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis.\nI will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Continuing the momentum from 2024, we've kicked off '25 with another quarter of strong performance across the board. Growing and diversifying revenue as we execute on multiple launches, accelerating programs in pivotal development and advancing the R&D pipeline.\nWe continue to reach more patients with more products and delivered $2.77 billion in revenue in the first quarter, representing 3% growth versus Q1 2024. This year, we are keenly focused on commercialization, and we are pleased with the early launch dynamics and physician and patient feedback on ALYFTREK, our fifth CF medicine, and JOURNAVX, the first oral non-opioid for moderate to severe acute pain in more than 2 decades, both of which were approved in the U.S. in just the last few months.\nWith these approvals and the continued global launch of CASGEVY, our gene-edited therapy for sickle cell disease in beta thalassemia, we are significantly expanding the number of patients we serve. We are also sharply focused on advancing the 4 programs currently in pivotal development. Suzetrigine in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, [ semelocell ] in type 1 diabetes, Inaxaplin in APOL1-mediated kidney disease and POV in IgA nephropathy. Importantly, Three of these Phase III programs are on track to complete enrollment of the interim analysis cohort or the full study this year, setting up a series of potential filings in 2026.\nAnd as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, I wanted to highlight 2 big recent povetacicept related milestones First, we completed enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in the Phase III Ranir IgAN trial. -- and second, we reached agreement with the FDA to advance POV to pivotal development in a second indication, primary membranous nephropathy. This is a notable milestone as Pub continues to deliver on its promise as a pipeline in a product with best-in-class potential. The start of the POI membrane study will also mark our fifth program in pivotal development.\nTonight, I'll limit my R&D comments on the pipeline programs with the most significant new information to share, specifically CF, pain, type 1 diabetes and the kidney programs. Starting with CF. Following our December U.S. approval of a lift truck, we have gained MHRA approval in the U.K. and a positive CHMP opinion in the EU -- as a result, we expect potential approval from the European Commission for a lift truck in the second half of this year, along with potential approvals in Canada, Australia and Switzerland. These approvals are in addition to the European Commission's early April approval of KAFTRIO for rare mutations, which followed similar approvals for Trikafta rare mutations in the U.S. and Canada late last year. adding hundreds of additional eligible patients in North America and thousands in Europe.\nThese approvals are a direct result of the team's decades-long painstaking work to establish and verify the hypothesis that the 3 unique binding sites of our CFTR modulators results in overall protein stabilization and have the potential to transform the lives of nearly 95% of patients with CF. Stuart will share more on the U.S. ALYFTREK launch shortly.\nNext on the horizon for our CF small molecule program is the next Gen or NG3.o CFTR regimen. With this program, we seek to reach our long-standing goal of bringing most, if not all, patients with CF to normal levels of CFTR function. The backbone of this NG 3.0 combination is VX-828, the most efficacious CFTR corrector that we have ever studied in vitro. It is completing Phase I development, and we remain on track to initiate a study with VX-828 in patients with CF before the end of this year. For the ongoing Phase I/II study of VX-522 for the approximately 5,000 or so patients who cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators, we have recently implemented a temporary pause to the study as we assess the tolerability issue, given that this remains an active clinical trial, we won't be providing any additional details at this time so as to maintain study integrity. We will update you when we know more.\nMoving next to the pain programs. First, the Phase III study of Suzetrigine in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a chronic peripheral neuropathic pain condition that affects over 2 million Americans annually, is well underway with ongoing enrollment and dosing. As a reminder, Suzetrigine has fast track designation for peripheral neuropathic pain and breakthrough designation for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\nNext, I'm very pleased to share that the study of oral VX-993, another NaV1.8 inhibitor in acute pain post bunionectomy is on track to complete this quarter, and we expect to report results from this trial in the second half of this year. VX-993 has fast track designation for acute pain in both the oral and IV formulations.\nLastly, we continue to make solid progress with additional NaV1.8 inhibitors beyond VX-993 as well as in our NAV 1.7 pain signal inhibitor program that may be used alone or in combination with NaV1.8 inhibitors, transitioning now to type 1 diabetes. [ Semyelosel ] remains on track to complete enrollment and dosing of its pivotal study this quarter, positioning us for global regulatory submissions in 2026 if the data are supportive. Recall, we expect about 60,000 severe type 1 diabetics who may potentially benefit from this first [ Zamilosell ] submission.\nBased on the high unmet need in T1D and the transformative nature of this therapy [ Zamil cell ] has multiple global regulatory designations, including RMAT and fast track in the U.S. prime in the EU and the innovation Passport in the U.K. In our other T1D work following the recent data from VX-264 or the cells device program, we have returned this approach to the research stage. We continue to make preclinical progress on our other approaches to clock the VX 880 cells from the immune system. These cells have already demonstrated transformative efficacy.\nThese approaches include alternative immunosuppressive regimens and gene editing to make hypoimmune-ilit cells, and we look forward to updating you as these programs advance. Finally, a few updates on our kidney portfolio, which now has clinical stage programs in 4 renal diseases, IgA nephropathy, AM KD membranous nephropathy and ADPKD, or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, starting with polvetasecept, a potential best-in-class dual antagonist of the bath and April cytokines which play a key role in the pathogenesis of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.\nFirst, in IgAN, as mentioned earlier, I am very pleased to share that we have completed enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the Rainier Phase III trial. Once this cohort completes 36 weeks of treatment, we will conduct the interim analysis and if positive, it will support filing in the first half of 2026 for potential accelerated approval in the U.S. In addition, our program to support the launch of POV with the subcutaneous auto injector for monthly at-home administration is well underway.\nAnd for full approval, we are making strong progress towards our goal of enrolling the complete cohort of 480 patients in whom we will assess eGFR through week 104. And Second, based on the positive results from the Ruby II basket study, we have reached agreement with the FDA to advance Poly to pivotal development in membranous nephropathy Beginning in the second half of this year, we are planning to initiate a single Phase II/III adaptive study of POV versus standard of care with the primary endpoint of complete remission at week 72.\nNext, 2 highlights on Inaxiplan for APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD. First, we remain on track to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the amplitude pivotal trial this year. Amplitude is a study of primary AM KD. That is to say, patients with 2 APOL1 variants and no additional renal-related comorbidities. After completing enrollment, when this cohort reaches 48 weeks of treatment, we will conduct an interim analysis. If positive, we will be poised to file for potential accelerated approval in the U.S.\nSecond, based on the positive proof-of-concept results of inaxipline in primary AMKD, the momentum in the Phase III study and interest from the community, we recently initiated the amplified study. amplified is a Phase II proof-of-concept study of inaxaplin in patients with AMKD and other comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes. This study is enrolling in dosing patients.\nTo close on our kidney pipeline, a few comments on VX 407 in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or ADPKD. VX-407 is a first-in-class small molecule protein folding corrector that is designed to target the underlying cause of ADPKD by restoring PC1 protein function, thereby reducing total kidney volume and preventing progression to kidney failure. As a reminder, by way of its mechanism of action, VX-407 addresses up to 10% of ADPKD patients and as in CF, we will seek to expand the eligible patient population with serial innovation over time. We have completed the Phase I trial of VX-407 and the PK and safety are supportive of advancement.\nThe Phase II proof-of-concept study is designed as a 52-week single-arm study of 24 patients that will evaluate the efficacy of VX-47 as measured by the height adjusted total kidney volume and we are on track to initiate this study in the second half of this year. For 5 years now, at the end of my remarks, I've turned the call over to Stuart. I'll do so for the final time tonight. Let me acknowledge and thank Stuart once again for the incredible run at Vertex and wish him the very best in retirement.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Stuart, And Duncan for a commercial update.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Reshma. I'll focus my comments tonight on the CF franchise, including the launch of a life and the continuing global launch of CASGEVY, building on the foundation we established in 2024. I'll then turn it over to Duncan to provide an update on the U.S. launch of generics in acute pain.\nStarting with CF with our existing portfolio of CF medicines, KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO and TRIKAFTA we have continued to grow the number of eligible patients taking our CFTR modulators. As expected, we also continue to make regulatory and reimbursement progress that enables us to expand to younger patients. KALYDECO is now approved down to 1 month old. Patients with rare mutations, TRIKAFTA recently secured U.S. and EMA approvals to expand the label for additional mutations. -- which means that the triple combination is now approved for mutations present in nearly 95% of all CF patients in our core markets and patients in new geographies such as Brazil.\nIn addition, as a result of better patient care, including the availability of our CFTR modulators, people with CF are now living longer than ever before.\nNow turning to the ALYFTREK launch. Our fifth CFTR modulator approved to treat the underlying cause of CF. In Phase III studies, when compared head-to-head with TRIKAFTA, ALYFTREK demonstrated noninferiority on lung function and further improvements in CFTR function as measured by sweat chloride. ALYFTREK was also approved by the FDA for an additional 31 mutations, not covered by the TRIKAFTA label and offers the convenience of once-daily dosing.\nRecall too, that ALYFTREK carries a meaningfully lower royalty burden for Vertex and extends our composition of matter patent protection from 2037 for TRIKAFTA into 2039 for a lift track. We're pleased with the early U.S. launch progress, and we're seeing uptake in all of the patient groups eligible for a ALYFTREK. Those naive to CFTR modulators or with newly approved rare mutations where we have seen the fastest initial uptake. Patients who've discontinued 1 of our other CFTR modulators and patients switching from TRIKAFTA who seek greater improvement in CFTR function and/or the convenience of once-daily dosing.\nALYFTREK prescriptions are off to a strong start as patients and physicians familiarize themselves with the ALYFTREK clinical data, including statistically significant lower sweat chloride than TRIKAFTA, the liver monitoring requirements when initiating therapy and the convenience of once-daily dosing. We continue to expect the majority of patients in the U.S. who are currently on CFTR modulator therapy, will switch to ALYFTREK over time.\nWe also look forward to launching a ALYFTREK later this year in the U.K. and other countries pending ongoing regulatory approvals.\nTransitioning now to CASGEVY, our transformative onetime treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia and -- since regulatory approvals in late 2023 and early 2024, the rollout of CASGEVY is progressing as we expected and gathering momentum across all regions. ATC activations and patient initiations continue to increase. as we now have more than 65 authorized treatment centers, nearing our goal to activate approximately 75 total ATCs globally. We're also encouraged to see many ATCs have now collected cells from multiple patients.\nAs to specifics on the other important marker of our progress since launch, approximately 90 patients have now had their first cell collections, meaning they have begun the patient treatment journey. Encouragingly, more than twice that number of patients has been referred by their physicians to ATCs to initiate the treatment process. And in Q1, 8 patients completed their treatment journey and received their infusions of CASGEVY edited cells.\nWith regard to access and reimbursement, we continue to make progress on the CASGEVY payer front. In the U.S., formal commercial coverage is either in place or provided through single case agreements. For Medicaid patients who represent about 45% of total patients, the majority of states have joined the CMMI demonstration project for cell and gene therapy access model, enabling fertility coverage for these patients and providing an alternative seamless approach for ATCs and states to the existing case-by-case coverage and state agreements.\nIn Europe, we have now secured reimbursed access for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia patients in England, Wales, Denmark, Austria and Luxembourg. And in the Middle East, we have reimbursement in Bahrain Saudi Arabia and recently added coverage in the majority of Emirates in the UAE. The interest in CASGEVY continues to be incredibly high in the sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia patient and physician communities globally, and uptake is accelerating as access and reimbursement is secured and familiarity with the process for collecting cells and infusing this truly transformative treatment growth.\nThe impact of CASGEVY is best captured by the real-world feedback from patients, caregivers and physicians. It's been inspiring to hear that caster patients now feel able to live their lives in ways they never have before. Whether that means having the energy to play with their kids, taking up snowboarding, without fear that the cold might bring on a pain crisis or investing in their education and careers given expectations now for a longer and healthier life. It is a privilege to be part of their journey.\nI'll close my comments today by saying what a true honor it has been to serve patients, employees and shareholders as the Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Operating Officer at Vertex. The company has never been better positioned from a scientific, commercial, financial or people perspective, and I look forward to following its continued success, including with Duncan as the new Chief Commercial Officer.\nI'll now hand over to Duncan to provide an update on the latest chapter in our commercial diversification with the exciting launch of generics in moderate to severe acute pain.\n\nDuncan McKechnie\n\nThank you, Stuart. It has been a privilege to know you for over 35 years and work with you at Vertex for the last 12. I wish you every happiness in your retirement. JOURNAVX received FDA approval on January 30 and has been available at retailers since mid-March. Although it's early days, we are seeing a strong reception for a novel non-opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.\nWe are pleased with the early launch, including broad retail pharmacy stocking, progress of reimbursement discussions and payer coverage, P&T committee reviews the breadth of usage to date and media coverage. To give you a sense of JOURNAVX progress thus far, I'll detail several key elements of our launch plan.\nOne, let me start with retail pharmacy stocking, which is crucial given the acute nature of pain. By mid-March, JOURNAVX was available at approximately 33,000 pharmacy locations including nearly every location for the 3 largest pharmacy chains in the country as well as over a dozen regional chains nationwide; two, I'm also happy to report that we've made rapid progress with payers, which is a testament to their appreciation for the generics clinical profile and the importance of a novel non-opioid option in the treatment of acute pain.\nAs of May 1, across commercial and government payers, 94 million lives already have covered access to JOURNAVX and 42 million have unrestricted access without the need to complete prior authorizations or step edits. With commercial payers, our negotiations continue to progress favorably. We've recently reached a formal coverage agreement with 1 of the large national pharmacy benefit managers to make generics available to their customers, collectively representing 22 million commercial lives.\nIn Medicare, we continue to engage with Medicare plans to secure off-cycle coverage in 2025 and 2026 coverage in line with Medicare bid cycle timing. For Medicaid patients, 10 state Medicaid plans and now providing unrestricted access to generics, meaning no prior authorization or step edit requirements and co-pays as low as $3 to $5 a as is common practice for Medicaid. We expect the coverage across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid payers will expand through 2025.\nThree, A key area of focus is hospital P&T committees. As a reminder, we are prioritizing approximately 2,000 hospitals, many of which will add up to 150 health care systems or integrated delivery networks. More than 1/3 of these target health care systems have already taken steps to initiate P&T reviews of JOURNAVX and some have already added it on to their formulary.\nFour, turning to patients. Our patient support programs are working as designed to provide a smooth and positive patient experience so that eligible patients who are prescribed genetics for their acute pain get access to the medicine for an interim period while payer coverage decisions are made; five, shifting to the policy landscape we are encouraged by the continued momentum and interest by federal and state policymakers to provide equal access to non-opioids. The critical need for non-opioid options was underscored by the presentation of new research at the American Academy of Pain Medicine in April.\nOur health economics analysis indicates that replacing just 25% of current acute pain prescriptions for opioids with nonopioids like JOURNAVX could deliver annual cost savings of $4.5 billion to the health care system and could prevent up to 260,000 cases of opioid use disorder and approximately 9,000 overdose deaths over the next 15 years.\nWith respect to state legislation, to date, nearly 35 states have already either enacted or proposed legislation to support the use of nonopioids. At the federal level, I'll highlight the no pain Act, which in January, began providing an add-on payment for non-opioids used in Medicare patients in the hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center settings. We continue to expect JOURNAVX to be added near term to the list of medicines approved for this add-on payment.\nLastly, an important indicator of our launch progress and a reflection of the unmet need in moderate to severe acute pain is that more than 20,000 prescriptions were successfully filled for JOURNAVX as of April 18. While it is early days in the launch, we are very encouraged by the breadth of physician types writing prescriptions for JOURNAVX as well as the wide range of pain types being treated, which is aligned with JOURNAVX broad label.\nWe continue to execute on the opportunity to transform the treatment of pain while also creating another multibillion-dollar franchise for Vertex.\nTo conclude, we are in a new era of commercial diversification at Vertex, and we look forward to bringing our transformative therapies to more and more patients and to keeping you updated on our progress.\nI'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Duncan. Vertex's Q1 2025 results demonstrate our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. First quarter 2025 total revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $2.77 billion. U.S. revenue growth of 9% year-over-year was driven by ongoing patient demand, higher net realized pricing and the early launch of a lift track. As expected, ex U.S. revenue in the quarter declined and was down 5% year-on-year.\nRecall that outside the U.S., Q1 2024 benefited from increased channel inventory due to the majority of Russia shipments occurring early in that year. In Q1 2025, Russia revenue was negatively impacted by the availability of an illegal copy product. Excluding the impact of the revenue decline in Russia, ex U.S. CF revenue growth would have increased in the low single digits. Included in Q1 total revenue was $14 million from CASGEVY and $10 million of collaboration revenue. First quarter 2025 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.23 billion, an increase of 21% compared to $1.02 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe most significant increases in R&D and SG&A expenses versus prior year were due to rapid advancement of our broad pipeline, including clinical trials for IgAN, pain and type 1 diabetes as well as the build-out of commercial capabilities in pain. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP acquired IPR&D expenses were $20 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP operating income was $1.18 billion compared to $1.34 billion in non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.8%. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.06 compared to $4.76 in the first quarter of 2024 and primarily due to increased operating expenses as well as lower interest income.\nWe ended the quarter with $11.4 billion in cash and investments after deploying approximately $425 million to repurchase more than 930,000 shares in the first quarter. Overall, our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged.\nNow switching to guidance. Given the strong start and clear line of sight to the balance of the year, we are raising the low end of our 2025 total revenue guidance from $11.75 billion to a revised range of $11.85 billion to $12 billion, representing growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. This outlook reflects our expectation for continued growth from our portfolio of CF medicines, including the ongoing launch of ALYFTREK in the U.S., followed by other regions later this year.\nWe believe the illegal copy issue is isolated to Russia and is fully included in our outlook. Guidance also includes a continued ramp-up in CASGEVY revenue as we treat more patients in geographies where we have secured regulatory approval and reimbursement. In addition, guidance reflects a revenue contribution from JOURNAVX primarily in the second half of 2025. And as a reminder, we expect volumes will ramp ahead of revenue due to financial assistance programs that are designed to provide eligible patients with immediate access while we work to secure broad sustainable payer coverage.\nRecently announced positive coverage decisions are included in our revenue guidance. As a result of these positive trends and as implied in our guidance range, we expect growth to accelerate over the remainder of the year delivering another strong year for Vertex in 2025. For combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D expenses and SG&A, there is no change to our guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion for the full year 2025. Consistent with prior guidance, this includes approximately $100 million in projected IP R&D charges.\nWe will continue to invest the majority of our operating expenses into R&D given the momentum in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs with 4 and soon to be 5 Phase III studies ongoing and multiple Phase IIs. The planned increase in commercial costs in 2025 supports our increasingly diversified commercial portfolio, a full year of investments to support the launch of JOURNAVX and potential near-term launches.\nGiven our differentiated business model and focus on specialty markets, we can make these targeted investments while maintaining attractive profitability and cash flow. We expect an immaterial cost impact from tariffs based on what we know today due to our low exposure to China and a geographically diverse supply chain. Additionally, much of our intellectual property is either in the U.S. or the U.K. Of course, given the dynamic nature of the tariff situation, including the potential for sector-specific tariffs, this outlook is subject to change.\nAnd finally, on guidance, there is no change to our expected full year 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. In closing, Vertex yet again delivered strong results in line with our expectations in Q1 2025, growing and diversifying our revenue with the launch of 2 new products in the U.S., ALYFTREK and JOURNAVX continuing the global launch of CASGEVY and making significant pipeline progress across the portfolio.\nIn addition, we now have 5 programs that are in Phase III or soon will be in multiple additional programs with first-in-class and/or best-in-class potential in the clinic in our early and mid-stage pipeline. These and other anticipated milestones of continued progress in multiple disease areas are detailed on Slide 17.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. Before turning the call to Susie to begin the Q&A period, let me also add my thanks and congratulations to Stuart. Stuart is a talented executive and team player who has contributed enormously to Vertex. He's also a friend. As Stuart passes the baton, we look forward to welcoming Duncan to the executive team and to future earnings calls.\nI'll now ask Susie to begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening all. My name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2024 financial results conference call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. .\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed medicines for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia and moderate to severe acute pain, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis.\nI'll now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before diving into Q4 and full year earnings, I'd like to provide a quick update on some leadership changes planned for mid-2025, as noted in our press release. Stuart Arbuckle will be retiring on July 1 of this year, after an almost 40-year career in biopharma and a stellar dozen plus years at Vertex, first, as Chief Commercial Officer and then as COO. Stuart reimagined the Vertex commercial organization as the company transition from hepatitis C and in CBIC to establishing itself in CF. And since then, he has led as Vertex's Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, with great skill and innovation. Stuart has been at the hound through the launches and commercialization of all of our CFTR modulators, beginning with KALYDECO and all the way through to ALYFTREK. He has also helped develop and lead the organization into this new era of commercial diversification with the launches of CASGEVY and JOURNAVX. Anyone who has had the privilege to work with Stuart as I have no steward to be a consonant professional, an incredible leader and an excellent developer of talent. He is uncommonly poised, leads with integrity and always puts patients first. As part of our carefully planned succession, Stuart is fully on board at Vertex until July, which will allow for a seamless transition. While we still have many months before he retires, I want to take this opportunity to convey my deep gratitude for his partnership and for all that Stuart has done for Vertex. .\nWe are very thoughtful and deliberate in how we plan for senior leaders succession, and we always do so with a long time horizon in mind. Thanks to this careful planning, we have never been in a stronger position to pass the baton from Stuart to other experienced senior leaders and we are very confident that the transition will enable us to execute seamlessly on the significant opportunities ahead. In that regard, I am very pleased to announce that Charlie Wagner, who joined as CFO in April of 2019 and whom all of you know very well, will take on the additional role of COO on July 1. I am equally pleased to announce that Duncan McKechnie, our longtime SVP and Head of the North American commercial team will be promoted to EVP and Chief Commercial Officer, also on July 1. We Duncan had over 20 years' experience in the industry across a wide range of strategic, operational and commercial roles in multiple disease areas and geographies at both GSK and Novartis prior to joining Vertex 12 years ago. Dunkin has been working side-by-side with Stuart since 2013, during which time, he played an instrumental role architecting the successful launches of all of our CF medicines as well as the CASGEVY and JOURNAVX launches in the U.S. In addition to his role as the commercial head of North America since 2022, Dunkin has also led the global health economics as well as the global value and access functions across the entire Vertex portfolio. I'm proud of the deep bench of outstanding talent we have at Vertex, and I'm looking forward to working directly with Dunkin as he joins the executive committee and steps into the CCO role and as Charlie continues as CFO and adds COO responsibilities in July.\nMoving to earnings. Fourth quarter performance wrapped up another strong year as the continued outstanding commercial execution in CF helped us drive double-digit revenue growth for our tenth consecutive year and the launch of CASGEVY set us on the course of revenue diversification. We continue to reach more patients and delivered $2.91 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, representing 16% growth versus Q4 2023. For the full year 2024, revenue reached a new milestone of just over $11 billion, plus 12% versus 2023 and exceeded our full year product revenue guidance of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion. From this strong base in 2025, we are focused on driving a significant expansion in the patients we serve with the ongoing launch of CASGEVY and 2 recent U.S. NDA approvals ALYFTREK, our next-generation fifth CF medicine approved on December 20 and JOURNAVX approved for moderate to severe acute pain on January 30. The JOURNAVX approval is landmark as it represents the first oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor and the first new class of pain medicine in over 20 years. We see this approval as significant for millions of patients for Vertex and for society as an important option to support public health efforts to curb the [indiscernible] epidemic. Our R&D teams have worked on this program for many years, and it is indeed my privilege to acknowledge their efforts and also to thank the patients and health care providers who participated in the clinical trials and made this approval possible. With these 2 recent approvals for ALYFTREK and JOURNAVX in hand and the continuing CASGEVY global launch, we have a keen focus on commercialization and our teams are working to secure broad access and reimbursement for patients who are waiting. As I detailed in January, as the number of in-line approved medicines grow and the late-stage pipeline advances, we anticipate significantly expanding the number of patients we serve over the coming years. In 2024, our transformative therapies have the potential to serve approximately 160,000 patients with CF, sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Now we can add 80 million acute pain patients to that reach, thanks to the approval of dynamics. And beyond moderate-to-severe acute pain, focusing just on the mid- and late-stage pipeline, we see to serve more than 5 million more patients including those with type 1 diabetes and certain renal diseases and then another 10 million-plus patients with peripheral neuropathic pain in the U.S. alone.\nTo give you a sense of our momentum, we are on track for key clinical development milestones in 3 pivotal studies this year. First, completing enrollment and dosing in the zimislecel Phase I/II/III study in type 1 diabetes which would position us to file for regulatory approval once this cohort has follow-up with 1 year of insulin independence. Second, completing enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of povetacicept in IgAN, which would position us to file for potential U.S. accelerated approval once that cohort reaches 36 weeks of treatment. And third, completing enrollment in the interim analysis cohort for inaxaplin for AMKD, which would position us to file for potential U.S. accelerated approval once that cohort reaches 48 weeks of treatment. In addition, we continue to execute the Phase III study of suzetrigine in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We're also making strong progress with VX-993, the next-generation NaV1.8 inhibitor in both moderate to severe acute pain and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We also have ongoing trials of potentially transformative medicines like VX-670 in myotonic dystrophy type 1, povetacicept in a basket study in indications beyond IgAN and expect to move VX-407 for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease into Phase II this summer. It's truly an exciting area of broad diversification at Vertex in terms of the revenue base, our pipeline and our geographic presence. Given the detailed clinical update we provided in January, I'll focus the R&D update tonight on CF and our clinical stage renal pipeline.\nStarting with CF. The U.S. launch is underway ALYFTREK, the fifth Vertex CFTR modulator regimen, while we are also working to secure approval in international regions. As we work to ALYFTREK to patients around the globe, we are already in the clinic with our next-generation CFTR modulator regimen. With each CFTR modulator regimen that gains approval, we raised the bar ever higher for ourselves and the field as a whole as we continue our mission to bring all patients with CF to normal levels of CFTR function. We term TRIKAFTA, KAFTRIO, the next-generation CFTR modulator or NG 1.0. ALYFTREK is NG 2.0. The NG 3.0 regimen consists of VX-828, a CFTR corrector; VX-118, a CFTR potentiator; and tezacaftor. This NG 3.0 triple combo regimen has shown even greater efficacy. In other words, even greater improvement in CFTR dependent chloride transport than ALYFTREK in our CF human bronchial epithelial cell assays, which have been shown to be highly predictive of clinical outcomes. We expect this regimen to be in the clinic in a study of CF patients this year. We also continue to enroll and dose the MAD portion of the Phase I/II study of VX-522 for the 5,000-plus patients who cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators. Results from the MAD portion of the study are expected later this year.\nMoving on now to what I see as a real renaissance in renal therapeutic drug development. We are focused on advancing potential therapeutics that hold the promise to treat the underlying cause of disease in 3 different severe renal conditions. First, inaxiplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD. As mentioned, we're working towards our goal of completing enrollment of the interim analysis cohort of the pivotal amplitude study this year. Amplitude is a study of primary AMKD. That is to say patients with 2 APOL1 alleles and no additional renal comorbidities. After completing enrollment, when this cohort reaches 48 weeks of treatment, we'll conduct the interim analysis. If positive, we will be able to file for potential accelerated approval in the U.S. In addition, I am pleased to announce that last month, we initiated a new study amplified which is a Phase II proof-of-concept study of inaxiplin in patients with AMKD and other comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes; second, povetacicept, a dual antagonist of the APRIL and BAFF cytokines, which play key roles in the pathogenesis of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. This tool inhibition mechanism of action, the preclinical and clinical data to date plus pove's once-monthly dosing frequency and small volume subcutaneous administration give us high confidence in its promise as a transformative medicine for patients with IgAN and other B-cell-mediated diseases. As mentioned in January, we expect to complete enrollment of the interim analysis cohort of the pove study in IgAN this year. To this end, I am pleased to report that we have now opened more than 100 clinical trial sites in more than 20 countries, including in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and enrollment in dosing are well underway. Once this cohort has 36 weeks of follow-up, we'll conduct the interim analysis. And if positive, it would support filing for a potential accelerated approval in the U.S. And third, an earlier stage renal program that represents an additional significant opportunity. VX-407 in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, or ADPKD, where we are nearing completion of the Phase I trial ADPKD is the most common severe monogenic disease amongst Caucasians and the most common inherited cause of end-stage renal disease in the U.S. and globally, an estimated 300,000 people in the U.S. and Europe are living with ADPKD, yet there are no treatments that address the underlying cause of disease. It is a life-shortening disease that is characterized by the growth of numerous cysts that impair kidney function and can ultimately lead to kidney failure. Around half of patients with ADPKD experienced kidney failure by the age of 60. The majority of ADPKD cases are caused by variants in the PKD1 gene, which encodes the polycystin 1 or PC1 protein. These inherited variants lead to the loss of PC1 function that leads to the proliferation of kidney epithelial cells, increased fluid secretion and the formation and expansion of fluid-filled sits. The progressive cyst formation causes an increase in kidney size and decline in kidney function. VX-407 is a first-in-class small molecule protein folding corrected that is designed to target the underlying cause of ADPKD by correcting PC1 folding to restore function, this has the potential to arrest assist growth. By way of its mechanism of action, VX-407 has potential in a subset of patients with protein-folding mutations of PKD1 estimated at up to 30,000 patients or about 10% of the overall ADPKD population. As we're doing in CF, we seek to serially innovate and over time, reach the full 300,000 patients with ADPKD. For VX-407, we expect to complete our Phase I study soon. And if the results are supportive advance to Phase II later this year.\nWith that review, I'll turn it over to Stuart for a commercial update.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Reshma. While I admit to having very mixed emotions at retiring from Vertex in July, I know that the timing is right from both professional and personal standpoint. It's been an amazing journey at Vertex over the last 13 years. as we've executed on our unique and differentiated strategy to develop and commercialize transformative medicines for patients with CF, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and pain, and I'm very confident we will successfully develop many more transformative medicines, such as in diabetes, renal and autoimmune diseases from our broad late-stage clinical pipeline. The business has never been in a better position scientifically and commercially than we are today. I'm also highly confident that we have developed the right talent to maximize these significant opportunities. I'm thrilled to transition leadership of our outstanding commercial organization to Dunkin as the new CCO. I've known Duncan for decades and recruited him to Vertex. He brings a rare combination of outstanding strategic thinking, results focused operational excellence and people management skills, and I have every confidence he will help lead the company to even greater heights. Although I will see many of you between now and July, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all our shareholders and analysts for your support and engagement over the years, and I look forward to helping you get to know Dunkin over the coming months.\nWith that, I will focus my comments tonight on our 3 recent launches, including the early U.S. launch of ALYFTREK, the continuing global launch of CASGEVY building on the foundation we established in 2024 and the initial launch of JOURNAVX in acute pain, starting with CF. Once again, we delivered strong CF results for the quarter and the full year as we further grew the number of eligible patients taking our CFTR modulators. We made rapid regulatory and reimbursement progress in 2024, and enabling us to expand to younger patients, patients with rare mutations and patients in new geographies. ALYFTREK is now our fifth CFTR modulator approved to treat the underlying cause of CF. We were pleased with the early approval of ALYFTREK which in clinical trials has demonstrated noninferiority on function to TRIKAFTA, the current standard of care for eligible patients with CF. ALYFTREK clinical trials also demonstrated further improvements in CFTR function as measured by sweat chloride. We believe this profile, along with the convenience of once-daily dosing sets the stage for ALYFTREK potentially become the new standard of care in CF. ALYFTREK is also approved for an additional 31 mutations that are not covered by the TRIKAFTA label. And finally, ALYFTREK carries a meaningfully lower royalty burden for Vertex and extends our composition of matter patent protection from 2037 for TRIKAFTA into 2039 for ALYFTREK. We have received positive feedback from physicians and patients for ALYFTREK. Early insights show enthusiasm for a new option that offers the convenience of once-daily dosing to simplify treatment and expanded eligibility for many patients who are today not being treated with a CFTR modulator, including those who have 1 of the 31 rare mutations that are not responsive to our other CFTR modulators. In these early days of the launch, centers are familiarizing themselves with the data and the liver monitoring requirements to frame conversations about initiation with naive, discontinued and potential SWIFT patients. We have seen interest in ALYFTREK from all of these groups of eligible patients, and I'm pleased to report that the first patients have already initiated treatment with ALYFTREK. As we think about the uptake of ALYFTREK, we are confident that CF patients will seek the best medicine for them. And we believe that for the majority of patients, that is a lift track. We expect that the short-term liver monitoring requirements to initiate a lift trick will be considered in the context of the potential for a lifetime of improved CFTR function and the benefits of once-daily dosing. Outside the U.S., regulatory reviews are underway for ALYFTREK, including in the United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. We look forward to the potential approvals of this best-in-class medicine in these markets in 2025.\nNow turning to CASGEVY, our transformative onetime treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. It is just over a year since the historic approval of CASGEVY, which has been enthusiastically received by patients, physicians, payers and policymakers and the launch is gathering momentum across all regions. Two important markers of our launch progress are ATC activations and patient cell collections. As we reported in January, we exited 2024 with more than 50 authorized treatment centers, well on our way to our goal to activate approximately 75 total ATCs globally. Approximately 50 patients across all regions have their first cell collections in 2024. And patient infusions of CASGEVY-edited cells have already occurred in both the Middle East and the U.S. We continue to make exciting progress in the Middle East. In November of 2023 and January of 2024, we secured regulatory approvals in Bahrain and Kasei, respectively. And on December 31, 2024, we secured regulatory approval in the United Arab Emirates. We are working to expand further in the region with anticipated filings in Kuwait and Qatar later this year. In this region, we now have national reimbursement in Bahrain, hospital-based coverage in Saudi Arabia and are working towards coverage in the United Emirates. Continuing with the payer landscape, we recently reached a reimbursement agreement with NHS England for the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease. This means that eligible sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia patients now have access to CASGEVY in England. In the U.S. Both SCD and TDT patients have access either through private insurance, where over 250 million lives are covered or through single case agreements. And in the Medicaid segment, as of last month, states may now begin to apply to participate in the CMMI cell and gene therapy access model, which we believe will further expand access for eligible patients as states may then subsequently opt in to the CMS negotiated agreements. We are focused on leveraging the foundation we established for CASGEVY in 2024 to build momentum in 2025 and beyond for this multibillion-dollar opportunity. as we work to get this transformative therapy to more and more patients around the world.\nShifting now to JOURNAVX in acute pain as we are currently 10 days post the milestone approval of this first selective oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor. The approval is so critical because JOURNAVX represents the first new class of pain medicine in over 20 years. It combines effective pain relief with a favorable safety profile. And based on its MoA, it does not have addiction potential. It is indicated for use across all types of moderate to severe acute pain. For example, post surgery, broken bones, sports injuries and has the potential to establish a new standard of care for the 80 million patients who seek a prescription therapy treat moderate to severe acute pain each year in the U.S. Half of those seeking out for their acute pain or approximately 40 million Americans each year are prescribed opioids, which although effective, have significant safety and tolerability concerns and addictive potential. In fact, tragically an estimated 85,000 people each year will develop opioid use disorder within the first year of being prescribed an opioid for acute pain. We believe we now have the opportunity to transform how acute pain is treated in the U.S. and to build another multibillion-dollar franchise for Vertex. We were launch ready for the PDUFA date and have now begun commercialization of generics. Our focus for 2025 is to engage with health care professionals, formulary decision makers and payers to establish the conditions for rapid patient access that will deliver long-term commercial success for our pain franchise. To that end, while still just a few days into the launch, we believe that the incredibly broad positive media coverage JOURNAVX has received since approval is one measure of the high unmet need and an indication of the societal importance of providing both physicians and patients with a new non-opioid option for the treatment of acute pain. We've already seen tremendous interest and requests for information from both doctors and patients. and we look forward to being able to serve them. Our 150-person sales force is actively engaging with health care providers and physicians on the compelling efficacy and safety data of generics and its role in all types of moderate to severe acute pain. In the institutional setting, we are engaging with roughly 2,000 high-volume hospitals and approximately 150 related health systems. We have line of sight to accelerate the typical P&T committee processes in many networks to support the use of generics in this setting. We are advancing our discussions with national and regional payers and group purchasing organizations to provide access to generics, building on our work preapproval to accelerate formula reviews and limit inappropriate utilization management controls. And lastly, with retail pharmacies, we are working to secure broad stocking agreements at national retail pharmacies and regional chains to ensure availability of generics for patients across the country. We have also now begun our nonpersonal promotional initiatives to physicians and patients to promote broad awareness of the first oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor for moderate to severe acute pain, such as embedded content in relevant websites like Medscape for physicians and WebMD for consumers, along with point-of-care marketing.\nFurthermore, we continue to see momentum and interest by policymakers both on the federal and the state level in providing equal access to non-opioid options for pain relief. The NOPAIN Act launched on January 1 and provides a Medicare add-on payment for non-opioids used in the hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center settings. We expect JOURNAVX to be added near term to the list of medicines approved for this add-on payment. The alternatives to Paymac had 78 cosponsors from both parties last year and is expected to be reintroduced in the new Congress with similar and growing support. Additional federal and state initiatives also continued to progress. For example, just 6 weeks into 2025, 17 states have already introduced legislation to support the use of non-opioid options. adding to the 7 states that enacted legislation for Medicaid and state-regulated plans in 2024. We expect more states to join this movement.\nOn the pricing front, we have priced JOURNAVX at $15.50 per pill or $31 per day at list price. We believe this price strikes a balance between ensuring broad access with the benefits it brings to patients and society, including the cost offsets that JOURNAVX may provide. It also recognizes our 20-plus year investment in pain. And significantly, we feel that this pricing enables us to continue to invest so that we can be the leader in serving patients with acute and chronic pain for decades to come. As previously discussed, in the early months of the launch, we are strategically investing in initiatives, including financial assistance programs for eligible patients that enable smooth, rapid access for patients prescribed genomics which is critical given the acute nature of the condition. And lastly, we expect to start shipping genomics to wholesalers by the end of this month with retail availability a few days later.\nTo conclude, we had a very strong commercial execution throughout 2024 and are already executing on the multiple launches and growth opportunities ahead of us in 2025. we are in a new and exciting era of commercial diversification with the ongoing global launch of CASGEVY, the launch of ALYFTREK in CF and JOURNAVX in moderate to severe acute pain in the U.S.\nI'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent results in the fourth quarter of 2024 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile.\nFourth quarter 2024 total product revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $2.91 billion, including revenue growth of 17% in the U.S. and 14% outside the U.S. The exceptional U.S. CF revenue growth in the quarter resulted from continued strong patient demand and the effect of the January 2024 price increase as well as a favorable gross to net dynamic. Ex U.S. revenue growth was driven by strong CF performance in many established markets as well as in newer markets where we have recently transitioned to long-term reimbursement agreements. Revenue in the quarter also benefited from certain nonrecurring items. Full year revenue of $11.02 billion represents 12% growth versus 2023, our tenth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Fourth quarter 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.3 billion an increase of 29% compared to $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the pivotal studies for type 1 diabetes, IgAN, AMKD and DPN as well as the build-out of capabilities for both our expanding pipeline and ongoing commercial launches. Also included in Q4 2024 results are $88 million of acquired IPR&D expenses, including for the Orna collaboration to develop next-generation in vivo therapeutics for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. This compares to $18 million of such charges in the fourth quarter of 2023. Full year 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $8.82 billion compared to $4.24 billion in 2023. Included in full year 2024 results are $4.63 billion of acquired IPR&D charges with the vast majority resulting from the Alpine Immune Sciences acquisition. Acquired IP R&D charges were $527 million for the full year 2023. The year-over-year increase in R&D expenses were driven by continued investment in our pipeline, including 4 ongoing pivotal studies. The year-over-year increase in SG&A costs was primarily driven by investments in our commercial organization to support the launches of JOURNAVX and CASGEVY. Fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion compared to $1.15 billion in non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023. Full year 2024 non-GAAP operating income was $696 million compared to $4.37 billion in 2023. Recall that full year 2024 non-GAAP operating income reflects a $4.4 billion charge for acquired IPR&D from the acquisition of Alpine. Fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21.3% was in line with our expectations, while our 16.3% tax rate in Q4 '23 benefited from higher U.S. R&D tax credits. Our full year 2024 effective tax rate of 91% reflects the nondeductibility of the Alpine acquired IPR&D charge. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2023 was 19.4%. Fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.98 compared to $4.20 in the fourth quarter of 2023, largely as a result of lower interest income and the tax rate differential previously noted. Full year 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42 compared to $15.23 in 2023. For reference, the Alpine AIP R&D charge equates to roughly $17 on a per share basis. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion in cash and investments. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged as we continue to prioritize investment in innovation, including external innovation by business development. We also continued our share repurchase program and deployed approximately $1.2 billion to repurchase 2.7 million shares over the course of 2024, including 961,000 shares in the fourth quarter.\nNow switching to guidance. For 2025, we expect total revenue in a range of $11.75 billion to $12 billion, representing growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates with the U.S. as the main driver of total revenue growth. This outlook reflects our expectation for continued growth from our portfolio of CF medicines, including the U.S. launch of ALYFTREK. Note that ex U.S. CF revenue growth will be impacted by a reduction of revenue in one country outside our core markets where certain intellectual property rights are being violated. This impact will be most pronounced in Q1 as the increases in international channel inventory that occurred in Q1 of 2024 will not repeat in Q1 2025. Guidance also includes a continued ramp-up in CASGEVY revenue as we treat more patients in approved geographies. Given the very recent approval of JOURNAVX, guidance also reflects a contribution from this launch in the U.S., primarily in the back half of the year. We expect JOURNAVX volumes to ramp up ahead of revenue as a result of financial assistance programs that are designed to provide eligible patients with immediate access while we work to secure broad sustainable payer coverage. To give you context on the launch progress of JOURNAVX, we will provide metrics on total covered lives and prescription data over the course of 2025. Also note that the expected benefit to gross margin in 2025 from the lower royalty rate on ALYFTREK will largely be offset by the higher cost of goods on our other new product launches as they scale towards their long-term margins. For combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D expenses and SG&A, we project a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion for the full year 2025. This guidance includes approximately $100 million in currently anticipated IPR&D charges. We will continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&D given the momentum in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs. The cost for 4 Phase III studies were a driver of increased investment in Q4 '24, and this trend will continue over the course of 2025 with the 4 Phase III studies continuing and multiple Phase IIs ongoing as well. The increase in commercial costs in 2025 supports our increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and reflects a full year of investments to support the launch of JOURNAVX as well as targeted spending on commercial capabilities for future potential multibillion dollar opportunities in renal therapies and zimislecel, for example. Given our differentiated business model and focus on specialty markets, we can make these targeted investments while maintaining attractive profitability and cash flow. Our full year 2025 non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%.\nIn closing, Vertex delivered excellent results yet again in 2024, achieving strong revenue growth, advancing our CASGEVY launch and gaining important regulatory approvals that position us for commercial launches, all while continuing to make significant pipeline progress across the portfolio. We are now launching 2 new products in the U.S., driving the CASGEVY global launch and enrolling 4 Phase III studies with 3 of them expected to reach significant enrollment milestones this year. These and other anticipated milestones of continued progress in multiple disease areas are detailed on slide 16.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll now ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.",

Please note this event is being recorded, I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms, Susie Lisa, please go ahead.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nGood evening, all my name is Susie Lisa and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2024 financial results conference call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President, Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer, and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will be making forward looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements including without limitations those regarding Vertex's marketed medicines for Cystic Fibrosis, Sickle Cell Disease, and Beta Thalassemia. Our pipeline, including the potential near term launches of the VANZACAFTOR triple in CF, and SUZETRIGINE in moderate to severe acute pain, and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions, actual outcomes and events could differ materially.\nI would also note that the select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. I will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susie good evening, all and thank you for joining us on the call today, we've continued our momentum from Q1 with another quarter of excellent performance across the board, including outstanding commercial execution in both CF and the early launch of CASGEVY. Our preparedness for the potential near term launches of the VANZACAFTOR triple in CF and SUZETRIGINE in acute pain as well as the rapid advancement of our broad and deep pipeline.\nIn CF, we continue to reach more patients, delivering $2.65 billion in revenue in Q2, and based on this result, and our outlook, we are increasing our full year product revenue guidance to $10.65 to $10.85 billion, which at the midpoint represents 9% growth versus 2023. In Sickle Cell Disease, and Beta Thalassemia, we are pleased with the reception from patients, physicians and payers as we continue the ongoing launch of CASGEVY, to bring this potentially transformative medicine to patients across multiple regions.\nAnd we are very excited about the multiple near term opportunities to reach more patients and deliver additional revenue growth from our programs that have completed pivotal development, including the completion and acceptance of two significant regulatory submissions. The VANZACAFTOR triple in patients with Cystic Fibrosis, six years and older which has been given priority review designation and VX-548, or SUZETRIGINE in moderate to severe acute pain, which has also been granted priority review by the FDA.\nLastly on the mid and late stage pipeline, I am very pleased with our continued rapid progress, I'll call out three specific programs. First the SUZETRIGINE LSR Phase II study has significantly accelerated and we now expect Phase II results by the end of this year. Second in the VX-880 Phase 1/2 trial in type one diabetes, we have completed enrollment and dosing in the original 17 patient study, and we have secured regulatory endorsement to expand the study to 37 patients in total as we advance towards pivotal development. And third in the POVETACICEPT program, having completed successful end of Phase II regulatory meetings, we will initiate the Phase III pivotal trial in IgA Nephropathy later this month.\nWith those highlights let me now turn to an R&D review limiting my comments this quarter to the programs with the most significant recent updates: Cystic Fibrosis, Pain, type one diabetes and IgA Nephropathy. Starting with CF, we are very pleased with the Phase III results from the VANZACAFTOR Triple program we announced in early February, as we continue to drive towards our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels, indeed to normal levels of CFTR function as measured by sweat chloride.\nThe VANZACAFTOR triple demonstrated an even greater reduction in sweat chloride than TRIKAFTA, a very high bar to have crested and thus sets the stage for the potential to have a new standard in the treatment of CF, the VANZACAFTOR Triple also offers the convenience of once daily dosing, and a substantially lower royalty burden. With regard to the VANZA Global regulatory submissions, in addition to the US acceptance, our filings have also been validated by the EMA in the EU and the MHRA in the UK.\nWith regard to VX-522 our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna, it has completed the single ascending dose portion of the Phase 1/2 study, and continues in the multiple sending dose portion, as a reminder, VX-522 seeks to provide treatment for the more than 5000 people with CF, who do not make any CFTR protein, and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Based on the pace of enrollment and study dynamics, our current expectation is to complete the study and share both efficacy and safety results from the study in the first half of 2025.\nMoving now to the pain program and our portfolio of novel highly selective Nav1.8, and Nav1.7 pain signal inhibitors, in acute pain, a few points to highlight. First, we are very pleased that the SUZETRIGINE submission has been accepted, and granted priority review by the FDA with a PDUFA target action date of January 30th 2025. Second, our next in class Nav 1,8 pain signal inhibitor VX-993 is in the clinic in a Phase I trial with the IV formulation, and is currently enrolling and dosing healthy volunteers.\nThird VX-993 will soon enter a Phase II study with the oral formulation in acute pain, following bunionectomy surgery, this study is on track to begin later this quarter. And lastly, we continue to make strong progress pre-clinically with our Nav 1.7 pain signal inhibitor program that may be used alone or in combination with Nav1.8 inhibitors. Just as an acute pain, we have multiple programs moving rapidly through development in Peripheral Neuropathic Pain or PNP, starting with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR, a condition that impacts more than 4 million Americans. There is a high unmet need in LSR. In the US, there are no medicines approved specifically for the treatment of pain from LSR.\nAs mentioned in my opening remarks, the pace of enrollment in this study has been rapid, and significantly exceeded our projections, study enrollment is now complete, and we anticipate sharing Phase II LSR results by the end of this year. Also in peripheral neuropathic pain, we are excited to begin the Phase III pivotal program for SUZETRIGINE in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN, later this quarter. The DPN Pivotal program consists of two identical, randomized controlled trials of approximately 1,100 patients each, with SUZETRIGINE at a dose of 70 milligrams, once-daily and evaluating the change from baseline to week 12 in NPRS pain scores relative to placebo.\nThe [inaudible] also include an active comparator arm of PREGABALIN, a key secondary endpoint is changed from baseline at week 12 in NPRS score for SUZETRIGINE versus PREGABALIN, assessed for non-inferiority. And if we meet non-inferiority, then we will test for superiority versus PREGABALIN. Lastly in PNP, I am pleased to share that we will soon initiate a Phase II study with the oral formulation of VX-993, in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, designed similarly to the SUZETRIGINE Phase II DPN study, this trial is also on track to begin this quarter.\nTurning now to type one diabetes VX-880, our stem cell derived fully differentiated islet cell therapy for people with T1D and impaired hypoglycemic awareness, who experience severe hypoglycemic events, despite optimal medical care. At the ADA meeting in June an oral presentation from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study included updated data with more patients and longer duration of follow up, and continued to demonstrate the potential of VX-880, as a functional cure for patients with T1D.\nThe data reflected 12 patients from parts B and C of the study who received a full dose of VX-880, as a single infusion and had at least three months of follow up. The results are remarkable, specifically all patients demonstrated islet cell engraftment, and glucose responses insulin production by day 90. All 12 patients achieved hemoglobin, A1c levels less than 7%, and all 12 patients also had a time in range for glucose levels of 70% or greater. 11 of the 12 patients greatly reduced or completely eliminated exogenous insulin use.\nThe three patients with 12 months of follow up and therefore evaluable for the primary endpoint each met the primary endpoint of elimination of severe hypoglycemic events with a Hemoglobin A1c level below seven, as well as the secondary endpoint of insulin independence. With these results we are planning forward towards the next phase of development for VX-880, to that end, we are very pleased to have secured regulatory approval to expand the original 17 patient study, which is fully enrolled and dosed to include an additional 20 participants.\nWe look forward to continuing the work with regulators to finalize the requirements for pivotal development and updating you on those discussions. Beyond VX-880 our cells + device or VX-264 program encapsulates the same the VX-880 cells in a proprietary device designed to eliminate the need for immunosuppressants. VX-264 is in a Phase 1/2 multipart global study. We have completed part A of the study at an initial dose with a stagger between patients, we are currently enrolling and dosing patients in part B, which is at the full target dose, also with a stagger between patients.\nAs a reminder, part C of the trial is that the full target dose with no stagger between patients. The last major R&D update pertains to POVETACICEPT, the lead asset from our recently closed acquisition of Alpine immune sciences, where enthusiasm for both the acquisition and Pove remains high. As a reminder, Pove holds the promise of being a pipeline in a product and has best. In class potential for the lead indication in IgA Nephropathy, given it's mechanism of action, with dual inhibition of both APRIL and BAFF, it's preclinical profile and the clinical data through Phase II in proteinuria, hematuria and GFR.\nThese attributes plus Pove's once-monthly dose frequency and small volume, subcutaneous route of administration give us high confidence in it's potential to be a transformative medicine for patients with IgAN. I am pleased to share that we are on track to initiate the global Phase III RAINIER study of POVETACICEPT in patients with IgA Nephropathy this month. To recap, we had successful end of Phase II meetings with the FDA and global regulatory authorities and we're very pleased to have reached agreement on the following important elements. The pivotal program is designed as a single, global, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of approximately 480 patients with biopsy proven IgAN and proteinuria.\nPatients will be randomized to receive either Pove or placebo on top of standard of care. In the US, the Phase III design affords us the opportunity to submit for an accelerated approval, a pre-planned interim analysis will take place when a certain number of patients reaches 36 weeks of treatment to evaluate the change in proteinuria from baseline to week 36. For full approval, the study will continue through week 104, and an assessment of GFR. Beyond the phase III study in IgA Nephropathy, Pove is also being evaluated in two Phase II basket trials, one in renal diseases termed RUBY-3 and a second in B-cell-mediated cytopenias termed RUBY-4. We look forward to read outs from some cohorts in these studies later this year and into next.\nTo close the pipeline review, a brief update on VX-634 and VX-668 in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD. Safety was demonstrated in the Phase I studies of both VX-634, and 668, however, based on the Phase I biomarker analyses, we have determined that neither VX-634, nor VX-668 would deliver transformative efficacy for people with AATD, and therefore, we have decided to discontinue development of both molecules. With these learnings, our research efforts in AATD will continue. I'll now turn it over to Stuart for a commercial update.\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nThanks, Reshma, I'll first discuss CF, then provide some highlights of the ongoing CASGEVY launch, and the outlook for SUZETRIGINE in acute pain. As Reshma noted, we once again delivered strong results in CF, as we grew the number of eligible patients taking our CFTR modulators, and we continue to expect sustained growth in CF over the near, medium, and long term. In the near term we continue to focus on reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups as with the ongoing KAFTRIO launches in the two to five age group in Europe.\nWith anticipated global approvals for additional rare mutations later this year, and through additional geographies, such as Brazil, where we now have national reimbursement for TRIKAFTA, patients ages six and above. We were also pleased to have announced in June an extended long term reimbursement agreement with NHS, England, which ensures access to our CFTR modulators for all existing and future eligible CF patients in England. Comparable arrangements have subsequently been entered into in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the agreements are a result of positive recommendations for NICE and SMC for our CFTR modulators.\nIn the medium term, we anticipate growth will be driven by the launch of our fifth CFTR modulator therapy, the VANZACAFTOR triple combination. We believe many existing TRIKAFTA patients may seek to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function and the added convenience of once daily dosing, and there are also more than 6000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators, who also maybe interested in a new treatment option. We continue to execute our VANZA prelaunch activities, including pre-approval information exchange with payers, and are encouraged by the outlook. And longer term, we expect continued growth in CF from developing medicines for the more than 5000 people with CF, who do not respond to CFTR modulators, which is the focus of our mRNA program VX-522.\nNow turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We continue to make strong progress with ATC activation as well as physician, patient and payer engagement, as we work to bring this potentially curative therapy to patients around the globe. CASGEVY represents an enormous advancement for the estimated 35,000 people living with severe sickle cell disease, and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in the US and Europe, as well as the estimated 23,000 eligible patients in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.\nTo update you on the two key metrics, we are sharing externally as important markers of our early launch progress. Firstly, ATC activation, we're pleased with our progress as we now have more than 35 activated centers, up from 25 last quarter and nine at launch. We continue to expect to activate approximately 75 total ATC's globally. Secondly, patient cell collections, we continue to see a growing number of patients beginning the treatment journey approximately 20 patients have already had cells collected.\nAs mentioned last quarter, patients are initiating the treatment journey in every region where CASGEVY is approved, the US, Europe and the Middle East, and we are pleased to report growth in patient cell collections across all of these regions this quarter. We also continue to make strong progress with payers in all regions, who recognize the transformative clinical benefits of CASGEVY, and are moving quickly to provide rapid and equitable access.\nOutside the US, we are building upon our early successes such as the early access program in France for TDT, and we now have an early access program approved there for sickle cell disease as well as reimbursement in Austria, Bahrain in KSA. In the US, given payer support across all market segments, commercial, Medicaid and Medicare, I'm pleased to report that we do not see coverage as a significant obstacle to patient access. We have always known that CASGEVY offers an enormous advancement for patients, we've also consistently communicated that the patient journey, that is the process to go from patient interest all the way to infusion of edited cells is long and complex.\nWhilst it's still early in the launch we have gained many learnings, interest level is high among patients, physicians, governments and other stakeholders. The value of CASGEVY has been widely recognized, leading to broad access and reimbursement by payers. The patient opportunity in the Middle East is particularly significant, given the high prevalence of these hemoglobinopathies and Government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens. And lastly, the treatment process does take time, but we are now even more confident in our view that CASGEVY will help large numbers of patients around the world and represents a multibillion dollar opportunity.\nShifting now to SUZETRIGINE, we believe this novel highly-selective, Nav1.8 pain signal inhibitor has the potential to provide a transformative treatment option for the 19 million patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain in the US. This quarter I'll limit my commercial comments to the opportunity in acute pain. We have continued to make significant progress building out our commercial team, we've now completed hiring of our strategic account leads, who will primarily focus on the leadership and formulary decision makers with IDMs, as well as our pain territory account managers, who post-approval will call on hospitals and other large treatment sites, such as ambulatory surgical centers.\nRecall that approximately 80 million patients are prescribed the medicine for moderate to severe acute pain each year in the US, with approximately two thirds of patients treated in the institutional setting. As a result, our field force will primarily focus on this institutional setting. We have begun engaging in pre-approval information exchanges in those institutional settings with IDM leadership and formulary decision makers, who have responsibility for formularies that enable use in both the inpatient and discharge settings.\nWe've encountered high levels of enthusiasm for a new class of treatment for pain, specifically for an effective and well tolerated pain medication that does not possess addictive properties by way of its mechanism of action. Hospital formulary and payer processes are well defined, and we are engaging appropriately to encourage and support swift reviews by the relevant bodies like PMT committees, including by providing key clinical and economic information. Depending on the institution or organization is can take up to 12 months post approval for hospital formulary and payer decisions to be finalized, but we are working to accelerate these timelines.\nWe anticipate engaging in contracting discussions in the latter half of 2024 with the goal of building formulary and payer coverage during 2025. We also continue to be engaged with federal and state policymakers, including state Governors, who have expressed strong interest in a novel, highly-effective and well tolerated treatment for pain, without the addictive potential of opioids. Federally in December 2022, Congress passed the no pain act, in which non opioid therapies are eligible for separate payment for Medicare patients in the outpatient and ACS settings, beginning in January 2025.\nIt is promising to see CMS continuing the process of implementation, as the annual outpatient prospective payment system or OPPS proposed rule was released for public comment last month. Because SUZETRIGINE is still investigational, it is not currently included in the list of seven drugs in the proposed rule, but we fully expect SUZETRIGINE will be eligible for separate payment once it is FDA approved. We view the No Pain Act as an important indication of the broad range of supportive policy initiatives, both at the federal and state level that can provide a meaningful tailwind to SUZETRIGINE adoption.\nWe are also encouraged by the progress of the Alternatives to Paint Act, which aims to level the playing field for access to non-opioids for Medicare part D patients. In the discharge or outpatient pharmacy setting it's important to understand that patients who receive a prescription must be able to access their acute pain medication immediately. Unlike patient with asymptomatic or chronic conditions, patients in acute pain cannot wait for another day or another week to have their prescription filled. We are therefore, working with key pharmacy retail organizations to ensure broad availability of SUZETRIGINE nationally.\nIn addition, we are planning a range of initiatives for the first year of launch, including co-pay assistance, other financial assistance programs to enable patients at the pharmacy to access their prescribed SUZETRIGINE prior to payer coverage decisions. We are very enthusiastic about the potential launch of SUZETRIGINE for patients with moderate to severe acute pain, and the impact we believe it will have on society. We recognize that even in the case of significant unmet need, it can take time for some components of our health care system to adopt new technologies and we are working to accelerate these processes.\nUltimately our goal is to fundamentally and forever changed the way pain is treated, and we look forward to delivering on the first part of this vision for patients with moderate to severe acute pain in early 2025. In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at Vertex, we continue to treat more CF patients around the world and are well advanced in planning for the launch of the VANZACAFTOR triple combination. We are entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in the US, Europe, and the Middle East.\nAnd our launch preparations for SUZETRIGINE in acute pain are well underway, as we seek to redefine the treatment of pain, and drive further diversified revenue growth. I will now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharlie Wagner\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent Q2 results demonstrate once again, our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Second quarter, 2024 revenue increased 6% year over year to $2.65 billion with solid growth of 7% in the US and 5% outside the US. The drivers of this strong quarter were in line with our expectations, including an anticipated reduction in channel inventories in select international markets. Second quarter US growth was driven by continued strong patient demand for TRIKAFTA. Outside the US growth was also driven by strong demand with continued uptake from the KAFTRIO launches in children's ages, two to five, partially offset by the reversal of the first quarter channel inventory build.\nOn the expense front Q2, '24 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D, and as G&A expenses were $5.43 billion, compared to $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Q2 '24 operating expenses include over $4.4 billion in AIP R&D charges, primarily as a result of the Alpine acquisition, which we previously disclosed is being accounted for as an asset acquisition. This compares to just $111 million of AIP R&D charges in Q2 of '23. Q2 24, non-GAAP R&D expenses of $697 million were roughly flat year over year, reflecting ongoing investment in the advancement of our broad R&D portfolio offset by reduced costs from the recently completed clinical trials, as well as the associated transition of certain costs from R&D to Cogs in inventory.\nQ2, 24, non-GAAP SG&A expenses of $280 million increased 28% versus prior year, primarily as a result of investments in the commercial organization, including launch activities for CASGEVY and prelaunch activities forces SUZETRIGINE in acute pain. We anticipate the quarterly non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will increase over the remainder of 2024 within our guidance, as we advanced multiple studies, including SUZETRIGINE, POVE and INAXAPLIN in Phase III programs, VX-993 in acute and peripheral neuropathic pain studies, and the expansion of the VX-880 trial in T1D.\nIn addition, we continue to invest in preparation for upcoming potential new launches, including the further build out of our commercial capabilities in acute pain. Q2, '24 results reflected strong revenue and underlying operating results, though due to the $4.4 billion AIP R&D charge from Alpine transaction accounting, we reported a second quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating loss of $3.1 billion. In the second quarter of 2023, we reported $1.15 billion in non-GAAP operating income. Our tax rate for the quarter was also impacted by the onetime non-deductible Alpine AIP R&D charge, leading to a reported non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 of -10%.\nCompared to a tax rate of 21% in Q2 of '23, aside from the effects of the nondeductible Alpine charge, there were no material changes in vertex is non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter, which would've been approximately 21%. The $4.4 billion AIP R&D charge for the alpine acquisition equates to an impact of approximately $17 per share on Q2, GAAP and non-GAAP results and drove a non-GAAP loss per share of $12.83 in Q2, 24 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.89 in the second quarter of 2023.\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in cash and investments after paying approximately $5 billion to fund the acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences. Additionally, we deployed over $300 million of cash in the second quarter to repurchase more than 700,000 shares now.\nNow switching to guidance, we are raising our 2024 total product revenue guidance to a range of $10.65 to $10.85 billion, representing 9% revenue growth at the midpoint at current exchange rates. We continue to have high visibility into this revenue outlook as we expect continued growth in CF as we reach more patients including younger ones in core markets and select other countries.\nGuidance also continues to include a contribution in the second half of the year from the commercial launch of CASGEVY, for Vertex operating expenses, our non-GAAP guidance continues to include a range of $4.2 to $4.3 billion in combined R&D and SG&A expenses, which is unchanged from the guidance provided in our last earnings call. As previously communicated we absorbing Alpine is projected non-GAAP operating expenses for the remainder of 2024 within our guidance range for R&D and SG&A. For acquired IP R&D, we now expect approximately $4.6 billion for the year, including the Alpine asset acquisition charge recorded in the second quarter.\nGiven that the Alpine AIP R&D charge is not deductible for tax purposes, we expect a non-GAAP full year 2024 tax rate of approximately 100%, note that the anticipated percentage tax rate is highly sensitive to projected pretax income, aside from the impact of the non deductible alpine AIP R&D charge, our underlying full-year 2024, non-GAAP effective tax rate would have remained in the range of 20% to 21%.\nIn closing, Vertex posted excellent results yet again, as we delivered strong revenue growth, advance our CASGEVY launch, and secured important regulatory approvals. We also strengthened our capabilities in preparation for additional near term launches, progressed our pipeline and made rapid progress closing and integrating Alpine, a compelling fit with Vertex's R&D strategy with significant potential as a pipeline in a product. We are already leveraging Vertex's clinical regulatory and commercial capabilities to accelerate development in IgAN with Phase III set to begin this month. We're targeting US accelerated approval in IgAN in late 2027, and a contribution to Vertex's revenue growth and diversification, beginning in 2028.\nIn addition, as we move through 2024, we anticipate further important achievements, including multiple milestones in our pain portfolio such as our Phase II data readout with SUZETRIGINE in LSR, Phase II initiation of VX-993 studies in acute pain and in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, as well as progress towards pivotal development in T1D. These and other anticipated milestones of continued progress in multiple disease areas are detailed on slide 17. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question you may press star then one on your touchtone phone, if you're using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys, and to withdraw your question, please press Star then two. And at this time, well pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nGood afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Noting that around 6,000 patients have discontinued CFTR modulators, as we think about uptake for VANZACAFTOR Triple, can you help us understand what the early launch dynamics could look like? And whether they can be a significant bolus of early adopters? And then just a second question, if I may, what is the relative contribution of CASGEVY to the updated product revenue guidance? Thank you.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nHey, Thanks, Salveen. We won't be breaking down the revenue for the CF franchise versus CASGEVY, and I'll turn it over to Stuart to tell you a little bit more about the VANZACAFTOR launch dynamics.\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nYeah Salveen, thanks for the question. I don't think there's going to be a single bolus of patients based on our research with physicians, that they are considering for the VANZACAFTOR triple combination. I would say that they are excited about the prospects for VANZACAFTOR both for their existing patients who are on a CFTR modulator, many of whom I think are going to be very interested in a treatment option, which promises the potential for increased CFTR function.\nAnd also being the fact that it's once a day, and then as you say there are also patients who are not currently on our CFTR modulator, who I think are going to welcome the opportunity for a new treatment option. So I don't think its going to be one or the other I think there's going to be a broad interest in the VANZACAFTOR triple across both patients who are persistent today on those who have discontinued previously.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nAnd congrats on the strong execution, I have two questions, first, can you just discuss the potential to develop VX-548 ex US for neuropathic pain, and the second, could you provide the latest on your preclinical development efforts for Nav 1.7 inhibitors? Thanks very much.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure thing. Hey, Dave This is Reshma, let me break that into two parts and let me take the preclinical Nav 1.7 first, and then I'll turn it over to Stuart to talk about our goals ex-US. So, we are making really strong progress on the Nav 1.7 inhibitors. They are still in preclinical development, but I would characterize it Dave as it's in late preclinical development.\nAnd to contextualize this a little bit more for everybody else, we expect that the Nav 1.7 could be used alone in acute pain or neuropathic pain, or that they could be used in combination with our Nav 1.8 inhibitors VX-548 or 993, or any in our portfolio. With that I'll turn it over to Stuart for a little bit on ex-US ambitions.\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nYes, Hi, David thanks for the question, so I would say that the clinical landscape and by that I mean, the kind of the treatment options in the way that they used is very similar outside the US. As it is here in the US with things like [inaudible], the acetaminophen in neuropathic pain, things like Pregabalin, Gabapentin, and then obviously opioids. And that's true for both acute pain, neuropathic pain, and I know, you're asking specifically about neuropathic. There are differences I think it's fair to say that the the level of abuse and misuse of opioids is less it's not zero, but it's less outside of the US.\nBut in addition, the pricing dynamics and the value recognition of healthcare and innovation by health care systems outside the US is very different, and as such our focus at this time is very much on the unmet need and opportunity to serve patients here in the US first, and ex US is something that we will consider later on.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jessica Fye with J P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHey, there, thanks for taking my question, I wanted to ask about your type one diabetes effort, how do you envision the regulatory path for VX-880? And for VX-264, the encapsulated cells product, I believe you completed Part A with the low dose patients. Is there anything you can share with respect to kind of what you're seeing so far with that one? Thank you.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, Hi, Jess It's Reshma, let me take those two questions, aaybe it we'll go with 264 first, and then we'll go to VX-880. So on VX-264, this is the cells + device program, you're exactly right about the stage of the program, were in part B, which is the full dose. It's a full dose with a stagger period between patients, I would say that our results are a 2025 time frame. We're making progress and I'm really happy to be in the clinic with both 264 and 880. On VX-880, this is the naked cell programs, or cells alone.\nThis is the one that has now completed, which is obviously a big milestone, enrollment and dosing in the original 17 patient study, we are in the phase of development where we're in full dose, with patients who don't have a stagger. I'm really happy with the regulatory discussions to date and their endorsement for us to expand the study to a total of 37 patients, so an additional 20 patients. And with regard to your direct question on how should we think about the path forward with regard to regulatory expectations?\nI don't have an answer for you today, because that's exactly the conversations that we're going to complete in the coming months, but I would think about the type one diabetes program more like a CASGEVY program than a small molecule program. You'll remember that the CASGEVY programming in either TVT or in a, Sickle cell disease was a very efficient sample size, and what we did in the case of CASGEVY is convert it from our Phase1/2 to a Phase 1/2/3 trial. Exactly what it will look like for VX-880, I'll look forward to keeping you updated as we complete the discussions with regulators.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO capital markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nHi, guys, thank you so much for taking my question, I think Stuart in your prepared remarks, you suggested that the launch of SUZETRIGINE might be more gradual than some other launches. Maybe once approved can you walk me through some of the gating factors to really get this into the hands of patients to have a [inaudible] impact on our health care system? Kind of what you have to do once approved to really get it to this patient? Thank you.\n\nUnknown\n\nHello, Evan thanks for the question and just to be absolutely crystal clear, our enthusiasm for SUZETRIGINE is growing as we get closer to the launch, not diminishing, and that's due to the benefit we got from market research, and also our interactions and discussions with physicians, post the Phase III data and the filing. But there are practical realities that we are going to have to face, they are things like, obviously the majority of patients with acute pain are treated in the institutional setting, that means we're going to have to go through formulary and MT processes with those institutions.\nWe're going to have to work with with payers, and work through their formulary and other policy adoption processes. And so whilst those policies are very well defined they do take time, and obviously, we're going to do everything we can to accelerate those timelines, and that's why we're already engaging for instance, with GPOs and [inaudible] leadership to support institutional use, we're talking with payers and PBMs to support rapid policy adoption.\nIn addition, we are going to want SUZETRIGINE to be broadly available at retail pharmacies across America, and so we're also engaging with the major retail pharmacy organizations as well. And lastly, because we know that these processes can take time, despite the fact, we're going to do everything we can to accelerate them, we are also looking at deploying a range of initiatives, including things like co-pay assistance and financial assistance program.\nSo that if a physician and patient decided that SUZETRIGINE is right for them, that patient can access the product without delay, and isn't forced to kind of abandon the prescription, because that particular plan or payer is not finalized their medical policy yet. So those are some of the challenges we're going to be facing, they're not unique to Vertex, they are relatively well defined and we are going to do everything we can to accelerate them, so that SUZETRIGINE can become the multibillion dollar drug we know it's going to become.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Raymond\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray\n\nHey, thanks, maybe two questions, first maybe on POVE, just a competitive question is IgAN seems to be getting a little bit more crowded. Biogen just got access to Felzartamab, which I think had a pretty interesting Phase II data. Just maybe talk a little bit about, you know, how you view the sort of match up to that, and maybe how does anti-CD38, compared to BAFF/APRIL inhibition?\nAnd then maybe a CASGEVY commercial question, just on the HHS suit around fertility treatments for patients. getting CASGEVY. Can you maybe talk about the overall timelines there with that case? And maybe also talk about how much of an impact it is to not have this reimbursement for fertility in place during the early stage of the launch? Thank you.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure hey, this is Reshma, let me take the first question first and then I'll turn it over to Stuart to talk about CASGEVY, and how that's going. So, important things to know about Iga Nephropathy, it is a rare disease, but it is one of the more common rare diseases, there's more than 130,000 with Iga Nephropathy in the US alone. And it's actually the most common primary glomerulonephritis, so there are lots of patients that are waiting to be served.\nTo date, there is no specific therapy that treats the underlying cause of this disease, and the reason for our enthusiasm, and after a Iga Nephropathy has been in our sandbox as it were a disease area of interest for a long time. And after, there has been some activity in this space, and a full analysis bias of everything available out there, our enthusiasm for Alpine and the that the POVETACICEPT, which is a dual APRIL/BAFF inhibitor, comes from the fact that it is the agent that works directly on the underlying cause of the disease.\nTo put it in a short way, the disease is caused by B-cells, it is the activation of these B-Cells, it is about auto-antibodies, and this drug APRIL/BAFF directly inhibits B-Cell proliferation, maturation, and proliferation. And what we have seen by way of mechanism of action, this dual APRIL/BAFF inhibition, all of the preclinical data potency affinity, as well as the clinical data, it is through it's phase two development, so we're talking about proteinuria, hematuria, GFR, and also the biomarker of what's called GBA Iga, that's the Aberrantly glycosylated Iga, which is the underlying problem.\nNot to mention Q monthly dosing it's subcutaneous and small volume, you put that all together, POVE has the most transformational profile, and holds the potential to be best in class for IgAN, but also holds the potential to have effect, transformative effect in a whole host of other B-Cell mediated kidney diseases, like lupus nephritis membranous anchor associated and a host of B cell mediated heme diseases like IPP, cold agglutinin disease, warm hemolytic anemia. So I couldnt be more excited about this molecule getting to it's first Phase III program, which is Iga Nephropathy.\n\nMultiple\n\n[inaudible]\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nLet me just rake a step back before I talk specifically about fertility preservation, so because of the treatment journey to get CASGEVY, which requires multiple trips to the, activated an authorized treatment centers, and because there's only a certain number of sites in the United States. And in addition, because of the B cell [inaudible] conditioning regiments, whether fertility risk comes in, we have sought to try and provide support to patients in two particular areas. One is travel and lodging, and the other one is in fertility preservation, and we want to provide those support services to patients equitably, no matter what their payer is.\nWe are able to provide both of those services to commercially insured patients, and we are able to provide travel and lodging support to government-insured patients because that has previously been ruled on by the OIG. While they have not given us an affirmative decision on his own fertility preservation and that's why we have launched [inaudible] to try and get fertility preservation approved with government-insured patients as well.\nIt's impossible to speculate exactly on the timing of when that suite will be heard and resolved, in the short term, I don't see it as being rate limiting to a successful launch of CASGEVY and I think we're already seeing that in the number of patients who are beginning the treatment journey, and in the number of cell collections. Having said that we are completely committed to the sickle cell and TET communities and we are going to fight for their rights to get equitable access, whatever that payer.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question, maybe two for me. Stuart you discussed at a high level your confidence in VANZACAFTOR pricing. Maybe just, I know you're not going to comment directly on the price, but just what are some of the inputs you're considering as you think about making that decision next year? And then any update on where we might see the full phase III data for VX548, plus fall. Thank you.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nHey, Terrence let me take the second question first. I think it's now been released the VX-548 SUZETRIGINE data have been accepted at the ASA fall conference, and it has been accepted in the best abstract category, so you can expect to see it there. I'm sure the teams are also going to be working on whole manuscripts, probably in the fall-winter timeframe, but the Congress acceptance of SUZETRIGINE as best in class abstract has already been announced. Stuart over to you,\nYes, Terence on VANZACAFTOR, we're going to approach the pricing of VANZACAFTOR as we have with all of our medicines, which is we're going to base is on the clinical benefits, and the value it provides to patients, and as you know we're very positive about the VANZACAFTOR profile. It performed brilliantly in the Phase III program, non inferior as anticipated to TRIKAFTA [inaudible], but demonstrated superior restoration of CFTR function, as measured by sweat chloride, and of course it has the convenience of being once daily. So we're going to take all those factors into consideration when thinking of the pricing, which is obviously a decision we'll make much closer to the launch.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGreat, thank you very much for taking my question, maybe question on LSR trial, if you could help set some expectations there? It's a placebo-controlled trial so if we think a two point improvement just like a VPN trial would be good enough here? And then the other is that, are you expecting any AD com for the pain, acute pain program at this point? Thank you.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure, Mohit, let me take the second question first. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are thrilled that SUZETRIGINE, the submission was not only accepted but granted priority review. The agency has let us know that they do not plan to hold an AD com as it stands today, but also as you know, the agency can let us know that they wish to have one at anytime between the acceptance of the filing and the actual approval.\nOn the LSR, so that's also a VX-548 trial, that's a trial that has significantly honestly, far significantly exceeded our projections in terms of enrollment and study completion, we're now expecting that study to finish this year, and for us to be able to share results this year. So with regard to this study and how you can think about it, it uses the high dose for the 69 milligrams from the Phase III study of DPN. The big difference between DPN and LSR is that LSR has no specific therapy approved for the treatment of this kind of radiculopathy pain.\nAnd so our Phase II trial in LSR is a within group, so it's within arm change of the NPRS score for the LSR sorry for the VX-548 group, and equally we'll have the placebo group within group change. And the goal for the LSR study, which frankly was the same goal as the DPN study is to get a magnitude of the treatment effect, so that we can appropriately power the Phase III study, and the reason the DPN study had a pregabalin arm was because pregabalin is an available therapy for the treatment of DPM. This study LSR as a placebo arm because there is no specifically approved therapy for the treatment of LSR. I hope that helps.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\n[inaudible] can we take two more questions, please?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am. The next question will come from Liisa Bayko with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nLiisa Bayko\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question, just to follow up on VANZACAFTOR, maybe you can talk about how you're expecting the rollout there? In terms of patient uptake, it's not quite as much [inaudible] some of your other therapies are, but nevertheless, like I you know the the value there is obvious, you know do you expect like quite quick conversion will happen slowly over time? Do you think the vast majority of patients will switch over? Just curious about what the feedback has been there? Thanks.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nStuart, any additional comments to make?\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nYes, just that we are we're as excited about the VANZACAFTOR launch as of any of our other CFTR modulators for the reasons I think you were referring to Liisa, it's got a great benefit-risk profile. And I think it is going to, as I said earlier, I think it's going to be equally all interest to patients who are on a CFTR modulator today, but would like to increase CFTR function as demonstrated by sweat chloride, because these patients know that is important for their health and wellbeing, but I think it's also going to be of value to those who discontinued. So as I said earlier on, I really don't think there's going to have one group or another, we're going to be more interested than others. I do think it's something that's going to be broadly of appeal to people. And as I also mentioned, not to forget the fact that it has the benefit of being once-daily which again, is an attractive part of a chronic medication. So as I said, we're as excited about our launch of VANZA as we have been about any of our other CFTR modulators.\n\nLiisa Bayko\n\nI was just trying to get a sense of the [inaudible] like how quickly people might convert over you're thinking? Do you think it would be a test flow and study or, you know, [inaudible]\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nYes, I mean, certainly the reaction we've had from physicians and patients, the profile has been very enthusiastic, I'm not going to speculate exactly on how much of the, how rapidly we're going to get the transitions and people restarted Liisa.",
    "content2": "Reshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nLiisa maybe I'll just add one thing if you want to think through it, patients with CF, usually visit their doctors once a quarter. As Stuart said, the patients are very aware of drug development and VANZACAFTOR in particular, as are their physicians. And patients have consistently expressed interest in thinking about medicines that may bring them the potential for higher efficacy. I think that's as far as we can go with regard to timing, but maybe those are pieces of information that are helpful to you.\n\nLiisa Bayko\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nHey, guys, thank you, great, two questions for us, on the alpine product, can you just remind me, I know you guys think it's best-in-class, but how to think about greater reduction in proteinuria versus an apparent program that will have data in first half '25. And is it your idea that you'll have greater reductions and therefore, better stabilization of EGFR or that it also will just be shining through in lupus and other autoimmune diseases for which we'll have to wait for Ruby-3 data?\nSo just maybe talk about and remind us how you think the benefits will be seen on that product? And then, really quickly on the acute pain launch can you just remind me on the comments on the no pain Act? You believe you'll eventually get reimbursement there, but that's more of a CMS exposure population to take that in consideration. On the commercial that's more about blocking and tackling on formularies and commercial plans? Thank you.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, Mike I'm going to ask Stuart to comment on no pain first, I think, it was a little hard to hear you, Mike, but I think Stuart, Mike's question is does the no pain Act pertain to government pain patients? And how are you thinking about commercial? And then I'll come back for POVE.\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nYes, so, no pain, Mike is looking at the add on payment to patients who are treated in the outpatient ambulatory surgical center setting. As you said, we were not listed as one of the products, so that is because we are not approved, and so yes, we do anticipate being added to that list once SUZETRIGINE is approved.\nIn terms of, in the Medicare area, maybe you're also thinking of the alternatives to Pain Act, which is looking to level the playing field in terms of things like step therapy, and not aligned with things like that, and utilization management in part D, and also making sure that there is parity in terms of the copay, for patients between opioids and non-opioids. In terms of all commercial, as you said, these are less relevant because that business is really sort of as you said, blocking and tackling is what we'll be doing in talking to commercial plans.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nAnd Mike on the question on POVE, I think the question was how should we think about POVE in Iga Nephropathy, and then how should we think about it in the other studies? Is it all about proteinuria? So the way I would think about it is, underlying cause of disease and B-Cell mediated diseases.\nWe have two Phase III studies going on, is a very clever design by Alpine scientists, theres, a Ruby-3, which is a basket of B-Cell mediated renal diseases, Iga Nephropathy, which is now going to Phase III this month. It has lupus nephritis in there, anchor associated nephritis, as well as membranous, all of these diseases are B-Cell mediated diseases, in many of these diseases proteinuria is important.\nBut I'll tell you for example in membranous PLA2R is a very important biomarker, and in some of the nephritities, as you may know, hematuria is very very important. So I think protein is, proteinuria is clearly very important in Iga Nephropathy, and it's prominence is elevated because of the FDA's acceptance of proteinuria in Iga Nephropathy, as an accelerated approval endpoint, but hematuria is important and some looking at biomarkers like PLA2R is important in others.\nAnd in the Ruby-4 basket, these are B-Cell mediated heme diseases, it's really not about proteinuria, it's about other markers of interest like, it could be something like hemoglobin, or in the case of ITP it would be platelets. But the way, the way I would look at it, and my enthusiasm for POVETACICEPT is because it is such a good B-Cell, it's such a good medicine to tamped down the B-Cells, because its dual inhibition and impacts maturation proliferation and differentiation of B cells, and that's where my optimism for B cell mediated diseases comes from.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYep.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks Mike, Chuck we'll wrap it there please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, this concludes our question and answer session as well as our conference call for today, thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal conference specialists by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.\n\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nGood evening, all. My name is Susie Lisa and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our 1st Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call.\n\nOn tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our website.\n\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed medicines for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, our pipeline, Vertex's anticipated acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange is presented inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening, all and thank you for joining us on the call today.\n\nContinuing our strong momentum from 2023, we kicked off '24 with another quarter of excellent performance across the board. Vertex continued to reach more CF patients, delivering $2.7 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 13% growth versus the prior year period. We also began our journey of revenue diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, in multiple regions.\n\nIn our late-stage pipeline, we continue to drive programs into Phase III and towards regulatory approval, creating multiple opportunities for both revenue growth and diversification including, one, completing our regulatory submissions for the VANZACAFTOR Triple in patients with cystic fibrosis, six years and older, in both the U.S. and the EU; initiating the rolling NDA submission for VX5-48, or SUZETRIGINE, in moderate to severe acute pain; three, advancing INAXAPLIN into the Phase III portion of its pivotal trial in APOL1-mediated kidney disease and expanding the eligible patient population down to age ten; and four, following the successful completion of the end of Phase II regulatory meeting with the FDA, we are on track to initiate the Phase III trials of SUZETRIGINE in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the second half of this year.\n\nAnd milestones in our early and mid-stage pipeline matched this pace of progress as we resumed the VX-880 trial in type one diabetes, initiated clinical development of VX-407 in polycystic kidney disease and three, achieved regulatory clearances in multiple regions, including the U.S., and initiated the Phase i/II clinical trial of VX-670 in patients with myotonic dystrophy type one.\n\nAnd, of course, we are very excited to expand the Vertex portfolio and team with our definitive agreement to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences, announced on April 10th. Alpine's lead asset, POVETACICEPT or POVE, is a potential best-in-class, Phase III-ready molecule for IgA nephropathy, or IgAN, a disease with high unmet need. POVE is also a molecule that holds a pipeline in a product potential in a number of other serious autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias in Phase II development. We see the acquisition as just the right fit, with just the right assets at just the right phase of development, where Vertex's capabilities can accelerate POVE's development in IgAN and other indications.\n\nAnd lastly, Alpine will add protein engineering and immunotherapy expertise to Vertex's capabilities, with particular relevance for our development programs in gentler conditioning for CASGEVY and immune evasion for our type 1 diabetes cell therapies. We are excited to begin working with the Alpine team and, together, advance POVE into Phase III in IgAN later this year.\n\nWith that overview, let me now turn to a more detailed pipeline review. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to the programs with the most significant recent updates: cystic fibrosis, pain, type 1 diabetes and the pending Alpine acquisition. Starting with CF, we are very pleased with the Phase III results of the VANZA Triple we announced in early February, as we continue to advance towards our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. Results from the VANZA pivotal program met our high expectations and were an important milestone in our progress towards this aspiration.\n\nResults from the two randomized studies in patients 12 and above, demonstrated VANZA was non-inferior to TRIKAFTA on lung function and superior to TRIKAFTA on sweat chloride, including as measured by the proportion of patients achieving sweat chloride levels below the diagnostic threshold of 60 mmol/L and below the carrier level or normal levels of sweat chloride of less than 30 mmol/L. Included in the pivotal program was the RIDGELINE study in patients 6 to 11 years of age. To underscore the potential impact of VANZACAFTOR, consider, 95% of patients age 6 to 11 in this study achieved sweat chloride levels below the level of diagnosis for cystic fibrosis and more than half reached sweat chloride levels considered to be in the normal or carrier level range of sweat chloride.\n\nWe believe these results indicate that VANZA could set a new standard in the treatment of CF. To round out the profile of the VANZACAFTOR Triple, it's important to note that the therapy also offers the convenience of once-daily dosing and a substantially lower royalty burden. With these results in hand, we've been working rapidly to compile the regulatory marketing applications and I'm pleased to share that we have completed submissions in the U.S. and EU for patients ages 6 years and older ahead of our mid-year goal. In the U.S., we used one of our priority review vouchers, which, if the filing is accepted, provides an expedited 6-month review versus the standard 10-month review timeline.\n\nWe're also on track to complete submissions in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland by mid-year. I'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy, in development with our partners at Moderna for the treatment of the more than 5,000 people with CF who do not make any CFTR protein and therefore, cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. We continue to enroll in the multiple ascending dose portion of the study and expect data late in 2024 or early 2025.\n\nMoving to the pain program and SUZETRIGINE, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor. SUZETRIGINE offers a compelling combination of both strong safety and strong efficacy, with the potential to treat moderate to severe pain across multiple settings of care. In acute pain, SUZETRIGINE has secured fast-track and breakthrough therapy designations and we were very pleased that the FDA granted us a rolling NDA submission. I'm also pleased to share that multiple modules have already been submitted and we are on track to complete the submission this quarter.\n\nConsistent with our serial innovation strategy, the next asset in our acute pain pipeline is VX-993. We recently received IND clearance for the intravenous formulation of VX-993 and have already started the Phase 1 trial. We're also planning a VX-993 oral formulation Phase 2 study in acute pain, which we expect to initiate later this year. Beyond SUZETRIGINE and VX-993, we continue to innovate in the NaV1.8 space and are also making strong progress pre-clinically with our NaV1.7 pain signal inhibition program, that may be used alone or in combination with SUZETRIGINE or other NaV1.8 inhibitors.\n\nIn peripheral neuropathic pain, or PNP, we are very pleased with the outcomes from the recently completed End of Phase II meeting with the FDA and are excited to begin the pivotal program for SUZETRIGINE in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN, in the second half of this year. The program will consist of two randomized sister studies of approximately 1000 patients each, with three arms in each study: a SUZETRIGINE 70mg arm once daily, a placebo arm and a PREGABALIN or LYRICA arm. The efficacy endpoints are based on the change from baseline to week 12.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the comparison of SUZETRIGINE versus placebo in the weekly average of the daily pain intensity score or NPRS. The first key secondary endpoint will test for non-inferiority of SUZETRIGINE to PREGABALIN on the same NPRS pain score and if successful, we will test for superiority. And finally, the second key secondary is quality of life measures versus placebo. In order to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of SUZETRIGINE, a subset of patients completing the 12-week study will have the opportunity to roll into a 52-week open-label extension study.\n\nOur goal continues to be a broad peripheral neuropathic pain label and in support of this goal, we're also studying SUZETRIGINE in lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR, a PNP condition for which there are no specifically indicated or approved treatments. LSR accounts for approximately 40% of all PNP patients and together with DPN, make up more than 60% of the PNP segment.\n\nWe are continuing to enroll and dose our Phase II study of SUZETRIGINE in LSR and I'm pleased to share that the study is on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year. Just as we transformed the treatment of CF, we believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain, both acute and neuropathic and look forward to helping address the unmet need of the tens of millions of Americans suffering with these conditions.\n\nTurning now, to type 1 diabetes. VX-880 is a stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islet cell therapy for patients with T1D and impaired hypoglycemic awareness who suffer from severe hypoglycemic events. I'm pleased to share that after data review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, the VX-880 study has resumed. Parts A, B and C of the global 17-patient study are fully enrolled and we expect to complete dosing soon. We look forward to sharing updated data this June at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting.\n\nVX-264, the next asset in our T1D program, is our cells plus device program. Using the same VX-880 cells, which have already demonstrated efficacy, VX-264 is designed to eliminate the need for immunosuppression by shielding the cells from the immune system in the proprietary device. This Phase 1/2 study has completed Part A and Part B is underway. Lastly, our Hypoimmune program, which aims to evade the immune system by introducing certain edits into the same VX-880 cells, is yet another approach to avoiding the use of immunosuppressives. This program continues to advance in pre-clinical development.\n\nI'll conclude with a few comments on POVETACICEPT, the lead asset from our pending acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences. We are excited about the potential of POVETACICEPT across multiple dimensions, including pre-clinically with its high affinity and potency against both APRIL and BAFF pathways in pre-clinical assays, as well as high efficacy in cell and animal models of B cell-driven diseases; clinically, with patient data in IgAN through Phase II that look potentially best-in-class in proteinuria, in hematuria, GFR and clinical remission; better drug-like properties with direct patient benefit, including once every four-week dosing subcutaneously with low injection volume; a good safety and tolerability profile; the broadest development plan in the field and a robust IP portfolio.\n\nImportant upcoming POVI milestones in the second half of this year include initiation of the Phase III study in IgAN and readouts from the ongoing RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies in autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, respectively.\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Stuart for a commercial overview.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Reshma. I'll first discuss CF and then, as we're entering a new era of commercial diversification, provide some highlights of the ongoing CASGEVY launch and the outlook for SUZETRIGINE in acute pain. As Reshma noted, we once again delivered strong results in CF as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFTR modulators. First quarter year-over-year U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 years old, following the approval in this patient population in April of last year.\n\nOutside the U.S., we also saw growth this quarter driven by the rollout of KAFTRIO in the EU in patients ages 2 to 5, following approval in this age group in November 2023. And we will continue to drive access and uptake in more EU countries over the course of the year. Our outlook in CF is bright, in the short, medium and long-term. We will drive growth in the near-term by reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups and additional geographies. For example, we recently received EU approval for KALYDECO in patients between the ages of 1 month up to 4 months old. We also expect regulatory approvals for additional rare genotypes for KAFTRIO in the EU and TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and Canada later this year. And Brazil is a good example of a new geography.\n\nUp to now, some patients in Brazil have been able to benefit from our CFTR modulators through named patient sales. We recently secured government reimbursement for TRIKAFTA in ages 6-plus and are in the process of launching TRIKAFTA for all eligible patients there. We will then look to drive further CF growth over the medium-term with the VANZACAFTOR Triple combination launch as many existing TRIKAFTA patients may seek to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function with the added convenience of once-daily dosing. And there are also more than 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators, who may be interested in a new treatment option.\n\nFurthermore, there are 31 additional rare mutations not previously responsive to our other CFTR modulators that are responsive to the VANZACAFTOR Triple. Our launch preparations are well underway, including pre-approval information exchange with payers and we are both encouraged by our interactions to date and excited by the opportunity to launch our fifth medicine in CF. Longer term, we expect continued growth in CF from our mRNA program, VX-522, for the more than 5,000 people with CF who do not respond to CFTR modulators.\n\nNow turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We are making strong progress with ATC activation, physician and patient engagement and payer conversations. Enthusiasm from stakeholders is high in all regions and our teams are working to translate this historic scientific achievement into meaningful patient benefit in the real world. Let me provide some insights on the launch with two key metrics we are sharing externally as important markers of our early launch progress: the number of activated authorized treatment centers or ATCs and patient cell collections. Recall that Vertex will recognize revenue for CASGEVY near the end of the patient journey, at infusion.\n\nStarting with ATC activation. You may recall we are prioritizing approximately 75 ATCs globally and already had 9 ATCs activated at launch, even ahead of knowing the final label or pricing for CASGEVY. We are pleased with our progress as we now have more than 25 activated centers, including centers in all regions where CASGEVY is approved. Even more important than the number of ATCs activated, is patient initiations and cell collections. Many patients have begun the treatment journey and as of mid-April, five patients had already had cells collected.\n\nThis is excellent progress given the short time frame since approval and the complexity and length of the patient journey. These sales collections have occurred across all regions where CASGEVY is approved -- the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. We also continue to make great progress with payers, who recognize the transformative clinical benefits of CASGEVY and are moving quickly to provide rapid and equitable access. In the U.S. commercial market, we have contracts and/or published policies in place for over 200 million lives or nearly 65% of total lives. In the government Medicaid sector, we have policies in place or active contract negotiations ongoing with 18 states. And, in the meantime, all states have confirmed their intent to provide case-by-case coverage.\n\nOutside the U.S., we are also making progress with reimbursement and access, either through formal reimbursement agreements or early access programs. In Europe, we see strong traction in France with a reimbursed Early Access Program in TDT. We're particularly pleased with our progress in the Middle East, which is a new region for Vertex and especially important for CASGEVY, given the high prevalence of sickle cell disease in particular and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens.\n\nSince receiving regulatory approvals from KSA and Bahrain, we have worked with local healthcare authorities and refined our epidemiology estimates for the region. Our work indicates that the eligible 12-plus sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia population in KSA and Bahrain that we could serve, is in excess of 23,000 patients, a potentially larger opportunity than even the U.S. These regions have the infrastructure to administer medicines like CASGEVY, given the prevalence of the diseases and relatively high volume of allogeneic stem cell transplants performed annually.\n\nAnd importantly, we have already secured reimbursement agreements in KSA and Bahrain allowing certain eligible patients to access CASGEVY for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia. In addition to having activated ATCs and collected cells from our first patients in the Middle East, we continue to work with local healthcare professionals to increase the number of ATCs and expand patient access in the region.\n\nShifting now to SUZETRIGINE. We believe this highly selective NAV1.8 pain signal inhibitor has the potential to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain. This quarter, I'm going to limit my commercial comments to the opportunity in acute pain. Throughout its clinical trials to date, SUZETRIGINE has shown a compelling combination of efficacy and safety, with strong potential to be used across a range of moderate to severe acute pain conditions, both surgical and non-surgical and across a range of settings.\n\nThis profile will ideally address the clear, unmet need among both patients and physicians -- effective pain relief with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. On prior investor webcasts, we provided details on this opportunity, including the magnitude -- approximately 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for moderate to severe acute pain each year in the U.S. and for high concentration, with approximately two-thirds of patients being treated in the institutional setting. There is further concentration within that setting in approximately 2,000 institutions that roll up to around 150 IDNs. Accordingly, they can be served with a specialty commercial infrastructure.\n\nWe have also detailed the mix of settings for the over one billion calendar days of acute pain treatment. 15% are prescribed and dispensed in an institutional setting, 35% are prescribed at discharge and 50% are prescribed in physician's offices. This quarter, I'll provide you with some insights on our go-to-market strategy and an update on the legislative and payer landscape. We are focused on the institutional setting, given these approximately 2,000 institutions account for 50% of acute pain prescriptions.\n\nExtensive market research has also helped us identify an initial set of specific acute pain conditions and procedure types with high clinical fit, such as high volume surgical procedures, pain conditions that typically require prescription pain medicines at discharge or where we can seek to replace or significantly reduce opioid utilization and the related physician specialties that are likely to adopt and champion SUZETRIGINE. The key healthcare professionals we will be targeting include orthopedic, general and plastic surgeons, emergency department physicians, anesthesiologists and pain medicine specialists.\n\nGiven the dynamics for new medicines to be approved for use in institutions, we expect the earliest uptake of SUZETRIGINE will occur at discharge. Recall, this discharge segment represents roughly 35% of the approximately 1.1 billion calendar days of acute pain treatment in the U.S. each year. The average prescription length in this setting is approximately two weeks. Treatment in this setting commonly includes opioids where prescription length is shorter -- four to five days -- due to side effect profile, addiction concerns and prescribing limits at the state and IDN and hospital level.\n\nWe are already engaging with key decision-makers across the formulary and access landscape, including pharmacists, PBMs, payers, IDNs and GPOs. We expect these stakeholders to make formulary and coverage decisions throughout the first year of the launch and thus, plan to engage in contracting discussions in the second half of this year ahead of launch, to support the potential for accelerated formulary adoption. We've also made great progress in the build-out of our commercial team. Our field leadership team are now on board and fully trained and having gated the hiring of the field force until after the Phase III data, we are now finalizing the hiring of 150 new customer-facing colleagues.\n\nFinally, we know the significance of policy in the world of pain treatment, with important legislation like the NOPAIN Act -- already on track for implementation in 2025 -- and bills like the Alternatives to PAIN Act recently introduced. Our long-standing efforts continue to help shape state and federal policy initiatives to one, encourage consideration and use of non-opioid alternatives and two, remove financial barriers to choosing a branded non-opioid. Overall, we plan for a high-science, digitally-enabled commercialization approach with a strong focus on population health decision-makers. In addition, both patient advocacy and public policy efforts complement and supplement our commercial activities.\n\nIn conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world and are well-advanced in planning for the launch of the VANZACAFTOR Triple combination. We are entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. And our launch preparations for SUZETRIGINE in acute pain are well underway, as we seek to fundamentally redefine the treatment of pain and drive further diversified revenue growth.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles Wagner\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent start to the year demonstrates, once again, our consistent, strong performance and attractive growth profile. 1st quarter 2024 revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, with solid growth of 8% in the U.S. and 21% outside the U.S. The drivers of this strong start were in line with our expectations, with some outperformance due to channel inventory phasing in select international markets. 1st quarter U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5, following the approval in this patient population in April of last year, partially offset by the typical pattern of seasonally higher gross-to-net in the 1st quarter.\n\nOutside the U.S., growth was also driven by the KAFTRIO 2-5 launch and a benefit from channel inventory phasing is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters, similar to the dynamics we saw in the first half of 2023. 1st quarter 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the 1st quarter of 2023. Included in Q1 '24 results are 77 million of acquired IP R&D charges compared to 347 million of such charges in the 1st quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses in Q1 '24 were relatively flat year-over-year and reflect growing investment in the advancement of our broad, earlier stage R&D portfolio offset by reduced costs from the recent successful completion of multiple late stage clinical trials for CASGEVY, VANZACAFTOR and SUZETRIGINE, as well as the associated transition of certain costs from R&D to COGS and inventory. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A costs versus Q1 '23 includes investment in the commercial organization and launch activities for CASGEVY and acute pain.\n\nWe anticipate the quarterly non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will increase over the remainder of 2024 as we advance INAXAPLIN into Phase III development in AMKD, initiate the SUZETRIGINE Phase III program in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and continue to invest in preparation for upcoming potential new commercial launches, including the further build out of our SUZETRIGINE team. 1st quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, a 48% increase compared to $902 million in non-GAAP operating income in the 1st quarter of 2023.\n\n1st quarter 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17.4% compares to 21.3% in Q1 '23 and includes a benefit from a discrete adjustment to Vertex's income tax reserves. 1st quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.76, including benefits from revenue and expense phasing as well as a lower tax rate, compared to $3.05 in the 1st quarter of 2023. We ended the quarter with $14.6 billion in cash and investments. We will use a portion of this cash on hand to fund the $4.9 billion acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, which is expected to close this quarter, subject to certain customary conditions.\n\nAlpine is a prime example of our priority for capital deployment, to invest in innovation, including external innovation via business development. We see multi-billion-dollar potential for Phase III-ready POVETACICEPT, given its transformative and best-in-class potential in IgAN, a disease area with high unmet need. We also look forward to exploring POVE's full potential in other serious diseases. Additionally, we deployed over $140 million of cash in the first quarter to repurchase 336,000 shares.\n\nNow, switching to guidance. There's no change to our 2024 total product revenue guidance range of $10.55 to $10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the mid-point at current exchange rates. We have high visibility into this revenue outlook. We expect continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients, including younger ones, in core markets and select other countries, as well as contribution in the second half of the year from the commercial launch of CASGEVY in approved indications and geographies.\n\nFor total Vertex operating expenses, we continue to project $4.3 to $4.4 billion in full year 2024 combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D and acquired IP R&D. This operating expense range continues to include approximately $125 million in currently anticipated IP R&D charges. Upon the close of the Alpine acquisition, we expect Alpine's projected non-GAAP operating expenses for the remainder of 2024 to be absorbed within this guidance range but note, the potential impacts of transaction accounting, including any potential acquired IPR&D charges, will be determined at the time of closing. There is also no change to our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance range of 20% to 21%.\n\nIn closing, Vertex posted excellent results yet again to start off the year as we delivered strong revenue growth, regulatory approvals and commercial launches. We also strengthened our capabilities in preparation for additional near-term launches, progressed our mid and earlier stage pipeline and entered the clinic in our 10th disease area of ADPKD. Importantly, we also announced the anticipated acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, a compelling fit with Vertex's strategy. Post-close, we aim to leverage Vertex's clinical, regulatory and commercial capabilities to accelerate development and commercialization of POVE.\n\nWe are targeting approval in IgAN in 2027 and contribution to Vertex's revenue growth and diversification beginning in 2028, leveraging a specialty market approach with attractive margins. As we move through 2024, we anticipate further important milestones -- as detailed on slide 18 -- to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. Please note that this pipeline slide will not reflect programs from Alpine Immune Sciences until post-transaction close. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls and I'll now ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. Go ahead, Ms. Susie.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nNope, that's great. Thanks, Chuck.\n\nOperator\n\nAlright. To ask a question, please press star then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. And to withdraw your question, please press star then 2. And at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\n\nAnd the first question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Hey, Geoff, this is Reshma. Let me take those questions. On the VANZACAFTOR Triple, if you go back and look at all of the CFTR-modulated labels, you'll see that we always have sweat chloride in the labels and they are reflected because it is, indeed, a pharmacodynamic or PD marker. So, I fully expect that the sweat chloride data from the VANZA Triple studies will be reflected in the label. Obviously, we are just at the point of having submitted the filing so, we're not at the point of label negotiations yet but if history serves as a guide, I expect that sweat chloride will absolutely be in the label.\n\nOn VX-548, Geoff, I think your question was about the DPM - diabetic peripheral neuropathy -- study but let me broaden the question about 548 in acute pain because that's the filing that we have already initiated the rolling submission. We've already submitted few of the module then, we expect, as I said in my prepared remarks, to complete the filing this quarter. We are submitting all of the data that we generated in acute pain and the same will be true when it comes to the diabetic peripheral neuropathy data and insofar as the acute pain Phase III results are versus placebo as the primary endpoint.\n\nBut there are data that have the opioid arm in there, I expect that it will be a discussion with the regulators about how exactly they want to display it. We are not at the point for the acute pain studies to have label negotiations and quite a bit far away from it for the DPN studies, which are just starting Phase III. But I will say that the reason we have a PREGABALIN arm in the Phase III DPN study is exactly for that reason, for us to be able to share the data with prescribers.\n\nYeah. So, on the acute pain side, Geoff, I think that the most important data are going to be the primary endpoint data. And I'll ask Stuart to comment on that in a minute. And with regard to securing reimbursement and ensuring that there are no barriers to prescribing non-opioid medicines, we see that as a very important place for policy. Stuart?\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Reshma. So, first thing I would say, Geoff, is to remember, we are seeking a broad, moderate-severe acute pain label so that the product could be used if the physician decides and the patient wants to for any type of acute pain. And so, we're not really looking for a label that's looking to niche us or pre-position us relative to other agents that are out there. We want physicians to have the broadest possible ability to use the product in the patients they see fit.\n\nAs Reshma says, the primary endpoint, which talks to the really strong efficacy we see in moderate-severe acute pain, is clearly very important -- as is all the additional safety and tolerability data that we have to support VX-548. In combination with the fact that, given its mechanism, it doesn't have addictive potential. So, we're really looking at the full range of efficacy and safety, which I think is going to be the most important thing that's going to allow physicians to decide who they want to prescribe the product for.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jessica Fye with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks for that question, Jess. So, just to set the stage, we see three distinct areas in pain, acute pain, neuropathic pain and then, everything else. And in everything else, I would add musculoskeletal pain. It's the kind of osteoarthritis kind of pain. We fully intend to serve all patients and I fully do expect that our NAV1.8 -- and when the time is right, the NaV1.7 or the NaV1.7-1.8 combinations -- our pain assets will serve patients with musculoskeletal pain. And I say that because, as you know, the predecessor molecule to VX-548, VX-150, already demonstrated that potential.\n\nBut we wanna go one step at a time here. So, first, we're gonna do acute and neuropathic pain and we see the research, development and commercialization as completely Vertexian. And then, for the musculoskeletal pain, whether that's with VX-548, the next-in-class medicine, VX-993 or the ones that come after that -- again, either NaV1.8 or NaV1.7 alone or in combination, any of those for musculoskeletal pain, we will get them to patients but we will not be commercializing that ourselves because it is a primary care cell. But we do absolutely see value there and we see a need to help those patients. But one step at a time. First, neuropathic and acute pain -- and that, we will do ourselves.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure, Salveen. Let me ask Stuart to comment.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYes. So, Salveen, all of the stakeholders that you described are going to be important in making decisions on the use of a new medicine in the institutional setting. So, administrators are certainly going to be important but as are physician advocates who are going to advocate based on the efficacy and safety of the medicine. And the process is a relatively standardized process, it's not going to be created merely for SUZETRIGINE.\n\nThis is a standard process that hospitals go through to decide whether they're going to put it on their formulary and typically go through some sort of P&T committee process where all of the various stakeholders, be it physicians, be it the pharmacy team, be it the administrators, are all going to be making that decision collectively. They're particularly interested in the use, obviously, within the institutional setting. Use in the discharge setting is typically something which is a little bit more straightforward and that's why I suggested in my prepared remarks that we see that as the likely setting where there is going to be the earliest uptake of a medicine like SUZETRIGINE.\n\nIn terms of some of the outcomes data that you were referring to, I think that the clearest way of describing is every patient that is treated with SUZETRIGINE when the other choice would have been an opioid, is essentially providing opioid-sparing for that patient. So that data, in many ways, is kind of already sort of readily available just from the data that we've already shared. And I think that data, in addition to all the other efficacy and safety data we've got, is going to be pretty impactful and compelling to the various stakeholders we've described.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Hey, Evan, just to set expectations, we're not going to comment very specifically on patients and exactly where they are in the cell collection process and in each region but I will ask Stuart to give you a little bit of color commentary on what we're seeing. And if I was stealing Stuart's thunder -- if you really think about when CASGEVY was approved, which is December and January, I am so very pleased with the number of ATCs that are activated around the globe and the number of patients who have already started cell collection. Stuart, is there anything you want to add?\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nOnly that we are expecting the momentum to build, based on all of the feedback that we've got and the trends that we're seeing in activations and cell collections. As Reshma said, we're delighted to have had five cell collections already. As she also mentioned, that represents patients in every region in which we are operating, including, obviously, the United States. We expect those trends to continue to ramp up during the course of 2024, which we've always said was going to be a foundational year for CASGEVY.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYep. Hey, Colin, let me break that up into two questions. One on inventory -- which I will ask Charlie to comment on first -- and then, I'll come back on 993 and 973.\n\nCharles Wagner\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Bruker Corp.\n\nColin, in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that we saw some benefit in the 1st quarter from the phasing of international channel inventory so, I assume that's what you're talking about. That benefit was on the order of $75 to $100 million in the quarter and I expect that to begin to reverse in the 2nd quarter.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nOn 993, 973, Colin -- this is all part of serial innovation. 993 is a little bit further ahead than 973 in terms of the pre-clinical package, the manufacturing and all of the things we need to do to get our medicines ready to go into Phase II. That's why that one is ready to go. 973 is just a little bit further behind. What are we looking for in terms of differentiation? There's really two major elements other than our overarching serial innovation strategy. But very specifically, one, we are looking for molecules that can be both oral and IV.\n\nVX-548 is oral only because our goal here is to own the waterfront on pain management, including for those patients who may be just coming out of surgery or for other reasons, not able to take by mouth. The second big goal here is to ensure that we have medicines with the right drug-like properties that can be, therefore, combined with the NaV1.7 -- which is also making good progress in pre-clinical development. So, that's what we're really looking for. And why 993 next? It's because it's a little bit further ahead. And 973, we're going to be working on just as soon as all of the data are ready there.\n\nColin Bristow\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. On VX-548 -- fall meetings, shall we say. You should expect more data on 548 with those Phase III results. Certainly, not only in Congress form but in publication-side, say, fall meetings? And let me ask Stuart to comment on CASGEVY in the Middle East. It is a really exciting opportunity for us.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Super exciting opportunity for us, Terence, which is why we provided a little bit more color on it. Specifically, to answer your question, we don't provide pricing data at the individual country level but suffice to say the price we are receiving in the existing reimbursement agreements that we've signed there, reflect the transformative value of the product and the lifetime benefits that patients can accrue from it. And that's going to be the same kind of philosophy we're going to have everywhere around the world where we're commercializing CASGEVY.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Phil, I will ask Stuart to comment on both CF in Brazil -- you know that we have regulatory approval and reimbursement there -- as well as formulary discussions on SUZETRIGINE. But just to make sure we are on the same page, the formulary discussions are separate from our discussions with policymakers. The common theme is that both of those stakeholders and frankly, all of the stakeholders, are very aware of the opioid crisis. They have high awareness of SUZETRIGINE and there is enthusiasm to using non-opioids. But those discussions are separate. Over to you, Stuart.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYes. So, just to add to that, Reshma, what I would say, Phil, is that the policy initiatives that we've seen so far are really looking at trying to reduce financial dis-incentives for patients and, indeed, for institutions to selecting a branded non-opioid in a market which is, obviously, currently dominated by generic opioids. And so, that's why things like NOPAIN, which is providing an additional payment above the DRG in the outpatient and ambulatory surgical center setting, is important there.\n\nAnd then, on the patient side, the Alternatives to PAIN Act is looking at in Medicare Part D, ensuring that there are no co-pay disadvantages to a patient for using a branded non-opioid in a market where there are already generic opioids. So, I'd say that's the policy landscape. Those are kind of slightly different discussions than we're having with the institutions and the stakeholders there, which are much more clinically-based on whether this is the right medicine to be using in the patients who are being prescribed and dispensed medicines in the institutional setting. So, that's how I would describe the difference between the conversations. They're obviously linked in some ways but they have a different focus from the policy side to the institutional side.\n\nYou know, I can't really speculate on exactly what's going to happen with, for instance, 2,000 institutions but my hope would be that that's not what's happening. I don't think it's very reasonable to expect a patient to have to step through a therapy which has significant side effect liability -- including addictive potential -- when there is a product available which has very good efficacy from a pain control perspective and has an excellent safety and tolerability profile, including lack of addictive potential. So, I don't think that would be something that we would, certainly, wouldn't be advocating and I don't think it would be particularly medically reasonable.\n\nAnd then, I didn't answer the second part of your question, which was around Brazil. We estimate there's around 1,500 patients who are eligible for TRIKAFTA that's 6 and over, in Brazil. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a number of those patients did already have access to TRIKAFTA through named patient sales but we now have a reimbursement agreement with the national government there, which is going to allow us to launch the medicine and make it available for all of those patients now.\n\nPhil Nadeau\n\nAnalyst, Cowen and Company, LLC\n\nThat's very helpful. Thanks again for taking our questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nHey Olivia, this is Reshma. Let me take one and three and then I'll ask Stuart to take the question on where we are exactly with pain commercialization. On number three, again, just to set expectations on CASGEVY, we're thrilled with the number of ATCs -- 25 since approval -- which has been in just the last few months. And we commented on the cell collection but we're not going to comment any further on exactly where each one patient is in their journey.\n\nOn VX-548 and acute pain, three things to say. Maybe the most important thing is, we'll know whether or not we've received priority review in about a -- after we complete the submission and then, it takes some 60 days or so for the FDA to tell us what the final review timelines will be. However, the leading indicators of whether or not we will get priority review are all quite favorable. We have fast-track status, we have breakthrough designation and our conversations with the FDA have shown me that they have high enthusiasm for a medicine that has high efficacy and does not have addictive potential.\n\nI'll turn it over to Stuart for the question about where we are with the acute pain launch and when we're going to be out there.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. So, the recruitment of our teams is going very well. Obviously, we are in the middle of our rolling submission here. Obviously, once we've completed that, we'll get an indication from the regulators on when we could expect our PDUFA date to be and we are going to be launch-ready. In terms of the question around revenue recognition -- this is unlike CASGEVY, I would say, which has an extended treatment process, where revenue recognition is at infusion. This is a small molecule and, therefore, we're going to be selling and distributing it in the normal way. And so, there really isn't going to be that kind of lag, I would suggest, around revenue recognition, that people are aware of with CASGEVY.\n\nOlivia Brayer\n\nEquity Research Associate, Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nGreat, thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Debjit Chattopadhyay with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Hey, Debjit, let me take both of those. On DM1 or myotonic dystrophy type one, we actually haven't had a chance to talk about it extensively but this is a program that is in Phase I/II inpatient. So, we are gonna have the opportunity in this study to not only assess safety but to assess efficacy as well. With regard to what the agency might wanna see for the endpoint for approval, the real answer is, I don't know yet because we haven't gotten to that phase in the clinical trial.\n\nBut your point around is myotonia is possible, insofar as this is a disease that is a rare disease, a serious disease and one that doesn't have any therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease or that very specifically works on the genetic defect, I think that opportunity is there and we've seen a lot of openness for accelerated endpoints in these kinds of rare, serious diseases.",
    "content2": "On IgA nephropathy. So, the most important things to know about IgA nephropathy is that it's a serious chronic disease. And this is a disease that, over time, leads to decline in GFR and end-stage renal disease, death or transplantation. The most important thing that I would be looking at as a nephrologist, is efficacy. Because proteinuria is known to translate to GFR and, therefore, the decline in renal function. So, if we have a medicine that has high reductions in proteinuria and, as I said in my prepared remarks, everything that we've seen from POVE -- pre-clinically and clinically through Phase II -- is best-in-class across many dimensions but certainly, including efficacy. I think that's the drug that physicians will choose.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nOne last quick question, please, Chuck.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am. That will come from Ms. Liisa Bayko with Evercore ISI.\n\nLiisa Bayko\n\nHi, thanks for squeezing me in. So, just two from me. Just to follow up on IgN nephropathy, have you thought any more about how you might highlight having BLISS? Because in addition to APRIL, I think that's one kind of key differentiator of this program and just wondering how you're thinking about how you could differentiate on that point. I don't know if there are biopsies or some kind of different point that you could really highlight the potential benefits of BLISS. And then, just for CF and TRIKAFTA for the quarter. I noticed you had your price increase yet sales looked slightly down, quarter-over-quarter. Can you kind of just describe, in the U.S., what's going on? Was there some higher gross net inventory changes, whatnot? It'd be great for some color there. Thank you so much.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Office, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Liisa. Let me take the IgAN question first and then, I'll ask Charlie to comment on CF. On IgAN, you are correct in pointing out that it's a dual inhibitor. It's an inhibitor of BAFF as well as APRIL. And this is one of the most attractive features of POVETACICEPT -- is this dual inhibition. Yes, pre-clinically, we can certainly share and we have information and you'll certainly see all of this in the fullness of time. The inhibition of BAFF and the measurement of that and how we can show that pre-clinically. We can also do that with APRIL.\n\nHowever, I think the data that's more interesting is the clinical data -- which is already available. And that is, with this dual APRIL-BAFF inhibitor for proteinuria. But I'd encourage you to look at the poster from the WCN meeting that Alpine showed. It has proteinuria results, it has hematuria results, it has GFR results and it has a composite of remission. And I find those data very, very interesting particularly, the hematuria results, clinically. Because, as you know, hematuria is a hallmark of this disease, along with proteinuria.\n\nLet me turn it over to Charlie on the question about CF and U.S.\n\nCharles Wagner\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Bruker Corp.\n\nYeah. Liisa, on the quarter, I wouldn't read too much into sequential quarter fluctuations. We saw strong volume growth in the U.S., year-over-year. As we normally do, we see some seasonal gross-to-net in the 1st quarter and the benefit of the price increase really isn't fully reflected in the quarter that comes throughout the balance of the year. So, all of those factors affect the comparison. But overall, very, very strong year-over-year growth in the U.S. and outside the U.S..\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nVP of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session, as well as our conference call for today.

And to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening, everyone. My name is Susie Lisa and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our 4th quarter and full year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese statements, including without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed medicine for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange is presented, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.\nI will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening, all and thank you for joining us on the call today. We delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2023, established a strong foundation for continued growth and started off 2024 with tremendous momentum with additional approvals for CASGEVY, positive Phase III results for VX-548 in acute pain last week and positive results for the VANZACAFTOR Triple Program in CF this afternoon.\nIn 2023, Vertex continued to reach more CF patients and achieved full-year CF product revenues of $9.87 billion, representing 11% growth versus 2022. Following the historic approvals of CASGEVY -- the first ever CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy -- our launch is off and running globally as we are now approved in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the US, Great Britain, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. CASGEVY is a one-time, precise, durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is generating strong enthusiasm from physicians and patients and excellent support from payers.\nWe're also working toward multiple additional near-term commercial opportunities, driving toward our five launches in five years goal. The recent approvals for CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, delivered the first two. Now, with the positive Phase III results from VX-548 in acute pain and for the VANZACAFTOR Triple therapy in CF, these are potentially the next two. And with a strong clinical stage pipeline with first-in-class or best-in-class assets, we are well on our way to our goal of five launches by 2028.\nIn addition to the rapidly advancing clinical stage pipeline, the next wave of innovation also continues to make progress. And as we announced last month, we are pleased to be advancing two new disease areas into the clinic. First, myotonic dystrophy type 1 or DM1, a serious disease with high unmet need and no approved therapies. This disease affects approximately 110,000 patients in North America and Europe. Our DM1 program represents our ninth disease area to advance into the clinic. We already initiated a Phase I/II study in patients -- that is to say, a study that we'll be able to assess both safety and efficacy -- late last year.\nAnd second, we expect to advance into our 10th disease area in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or ADPKD, the most common genetic kidney disease that affects approximately 250,000 patients in the US and EU alone, into the clinic with a healthy volunteer study in the first half of this year.\nWith that overview, let me now turn to a more detailed pipeline review. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to the programs with significant recent updates -- cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and pain, so as to leave time for your questions. Starting with cystic fibrosis and our next-in-class VANZACAFTOR Triple Combination therapy. This afternoon, we reported positive results from the Phase III program, including the SKYLINE 102 and 103 studies in patients 12 years and above and the RIDGELINE study in patients ages 6 to 11.\nWe are very pleased with these results and the arc of progress in treating patients with CF as we continue to advance our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. Treatment with the VANZA Triple met all primary and secondary end points in the three Phase III studies and once again, our proprietary HBE assays, were both qualitatively and quantitatively predictive. In the SKYLINE 102 and 103 trials, the VANZACAFTOR Triple combination met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus TRIKAFTA on ppFEV1, consistent with our expectations. The difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI and VANZA-treated groups was negligible.\nIn SKYLINE 102, the LS mean difference was 0.2, numerically favoring VANZA and meeting non-inferiority with a P value of less than 0.0001. And in the SKYLINE 103 study, again, the difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI and VANZA-treated groups was negligible and numerically favored VANZACAFTOR, with LS mean difference of 0.2, meeting non-inferiority with a P value of less than 0.0001. Recall, the improvement in ppFEV1 in treatment-naive patients in the original TRI Phase III program was approximately 14%.\nIn addition, all key secondary endpoints were met across SKYLINE 102 and 103 and showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in sweat chloride. The sweat chloride results were measured in three key secondary end points. First, the overall achieved sweat chloride levels and the two RCTs were lower in the VANZA-treated group versus the TRIKAFTA-treated group. The LS mean difference was -8.4 with a P value of less than 0.0001. In SKYLINE 102, the LS mean difference was -2.8 with a P value of 0.0034 in SKYLINE 103. The key difference, of course, in SKYLINE 102 and 103 was the genotype studied.\nSKYLINE 102 included FMF patients who have more severe disease and therefore, higher sweat chloride levels at baseline. And SKYLINE 103 included FF and other responsive mutations with lower baseline sweat chloride levels. Next, the second key secondary end point of proportion of sweat chloride, less than 60 millimoles, pooled across two studies. 86% of patients in the VANZA-treated groups and 77% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 60 millimoles, leading to an odds ratio of 2.21 and a P value of 0.0001. This means about two times greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 60 with VANZA versus TRIKAFTA.\nLast, the third key secondary end point of proportion of sweat chloride less than 30 millimoles, pooled across the two studies. 31% of patients in the VANZA-treated groups versus 23% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 30 millimolars, leading to an odds ratio of 2.87 and a P value of 0.0001. This means about three times greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 30 with VANZACAFTOR versus TRIKAFTA. The results were even more pronounced in the RIDGELINE study evaluating children ages 6 to 11. The primary endpoint in this single arm study was safety, which I will come to in a minute.\nOn efficacy, 95% of patients achieved sweat chloride below 60 millimole, the diagnostic threshold for cystic fibrosis. And more than half reached sweat chloride levels below the carrier level threshold of 30 millimoles. These sweat chloride results with the VANZA Triple are both impressive and important. Let me take a step back to frame the significance of these results. While CF is a systemic multi-organ disease, historically, the focus has been primarily on lung function as measured by ppFEV1. Given, it is the most visible symptom and typically the cause of death in CF patients. ppFEV1 is also the regulatory-enabling endpoint.\nGiven the strides we've made with TRIKAFTA, we believe we may have reached the maximum potential benefit in lung function from CFTR modulators. Thus, our objective with VANZACAFTOR moves beyond the focus on lung function to a broader, more ambitious goal to improve CFTR protein function as measured by lower sweat chloride levels and deliver even greater systemic benefit than TRIKAFTA. To be clear, the goal with the VANZA pivotal development program was to show the lung function benefit was non-inferior to TRIKAFTA and over and above that, to deliver additional benefit on sweat chloride, the direct marker of CFTR protein function.\nA note on CFTR protein -- CFTR protein dysfunction is the underlying pathophysiology in CF. And while CF is often diagnosed by a genetic test at birth, it is confirmed via a sweat chloride test because it is the direct measure of CFTR protein dysfunction. Simply put, higher levels of sweat chloride is associated with more severe disease. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to restore CFTR protein function, as measured by sweat chloride, back to normal or as close to normal as possible so that there is no manifestation of disease. And more specifically, sweat chloride values below 60 millimoles are associated with improved outcomes, such as better and more stable lung function, fewer pulmonary exacerbations, better quality of life and improved survival.\nVertex's ultimate treatment goal is to restore sweat chloride levels to below 30, which is considered normal and are typical of CF carriers who do not have the disease. For instance, the parents of children with CF. Thus, our goal in designing the VANZACAFTOR Triple therapy studies was to test if even more patients treated with VANZA could achieve those sweat chloride thresholds of less than 60 and less than 30 than those treated with TRIKAFTA.\nSwitching to safety, the VANZA Triple was generally safe and well-tolerated in all three studies. The adverse events seen in the VANZA Triple pivotal development program are consistent with the underlying disease and with the incidents and nature of adverse events, we have seen with previous CFTR modulators. As a reminder, and to round out the profile of the VANZACAFTOR Triple, this therapy offers the convenience of once-daily dosing for patients and a substantially lower royalty burden.\nIn summary, we set a goal to establish a new and higher bar in the treatment of CF with CFTR modulators and with these Phase III VANZA Triple results, we have the first evidence that we have done so. And with these results, we now know that the VANZA Triple has indeed surpassed the very high bar set by TRIKAFTA in people with CF, ages 6 and older. And by treating patients early with the VANZA Triple, we have the potential to possibly prevent systemic manifestations of CF in more people. These results also reaffirm our conviction that continued investment in scientific and serial innovation will allow us to complete our journey to transform CF by bringing all eligible CF patients down to carrier levels of sweat chloride, where there are no manifestations of disease.\nI want to acknowledge the CF patients in our clinical trials, who put their trust in us. As well as the Vertex San Diego team and the CF R&D teams, some of whom have worked on CF for more than 20 years, to deliver yet another potentially transformative medicine. We're working rapidly to compile the regulatory submissions and anticipate filing in both the US and Europe, for patients ages 6 and older, by the middle of 2024. We will be using one of our priority review vouchers, entitling us to designate the VANZA NDA for priority review, which provides an expedited six-month review versus a standard 10-month review timeline.\nI'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna, for the more than 5,000 CF patients who do not make any CFTR protein and therefore, cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Late last year, we completed enrollment and dosing in the single-ascending dose portion of our study for VX-522 and initiated the multiple-ascending dose portion of the study. This study continues to screen, enroll and dose patients and we expect data late this year or early next.\nTurning now to CASGEVY, a precise durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that delivers a potential one-time functional cure for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. CASGEVY represents an enormous advancement for the estimated 35,000 people living with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia across the US and Europe, as well as thousands of patients in other regions, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.\nCASGEVY represents a significant commercial opportunity as well. And Stuart will discuss the strong start to the launch, following the rapid approvals in multiple countries. While these launches are underway, we are awaiting approval in the EU, where CASGEVY has received CHMP Positive Opinion for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. CASGEVY's also under review in Switzerland and we anticipate filing in Canada this quarter.\nLastly on CASGEVY -- recognizing the importance of treating patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia early in life to minimize organ damage and other complications of the disease, we are conducting studies in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia to expand the label to younger age groups. To that end, we recently completed enrollment in our two global Phase III studies in patients 5 to 11 years of age and dosing in these studies is underway.\nMoving to the pain program and VX-548, our novel highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor. With VX-548, we finally have the possibility of a medicine that has the compelling combination of both strong efficacy and strong safety that can be used for multiple moderate to severe pain types across multiple settings of care. Last week, we detailed the positive results from the three Phase III trials that comprise our pivotal program for VX-548 in acute pain, including randomized placebo-controlled trials in two different pain models -- abdominoplasty, a soft tissue pain model and bunionectomy, a hard tissue pain model. And a single arm safety and effectiveness trial in a broad range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.\nBoth the abdominoplasty and bunionectomy RCT's met the primary endpoint with statistically significant improvement in pain, compared to placebo on the primary endpoint of SPID48. The SPID48 is derived from a change in the numeric pain rating scale or NPRS. Practicing physicians tell us, that in addition to SPID48, they focus on this reduction in the NPRS from baseline and this change in baseline in NPRS score is also how clinical meaningfulness is assessed in the field. In acute post-operative pain studies, clinical meaningfulness is defined by at least a two-point change in NPRS from baseline or at least a 30% reduction in NPRS from baseline.\nIn that context, both RCT's demonstrated that treatment with VX-548 led to rapid, clinically meaningful reductions on the NPRS with more than three points of pain reduction or roughly a 50% reduction from baseline in the VX-548 arms. The single arm safety and effectiveness trial was conducted in a broad range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions and supported longer term safety and effectiveness. VX-548 was safe and well-tolerated across all three studies, including multiple acute pain types and settings.\nOf importance, with respect to safety in the two RCTs, the incidents of adverse events in the VX-548 arms was lower than placebo and uncommon and noteworthy-finding. We believe the results of this comprehensive Phase III program support a broad moderate to severe acute pain label and if approved, should enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings. VX-548 has already secured fast track and breakthrough designations and we are working with urgency to file the NDA by mid 2024.\nMoving now to neuropathic pain. Two months ago, we also reported positive results from our Phase II study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy -- one type of peripheral neuropathic pain and another area of high unmet need. We look forward to our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA towards the end of this quarter and starting our Phase III program thereafter. We also continued to enroll and dose our second Phase II neuropathic pain study of VX-548 in lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR.\nUltimately, we seek a broad neuropathic pain label and believe by studying two of the largest pain segments, DPN and LSR, which together represent more than 60% of all peripheral neuropathic pain -- we have a pathway to that broad indication. Just as we transformed the treatment of CF, we believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain -- both acute and neuropathic -- based on the compelling and consistent results we have seen with VX-548.\nWe now have results in hand from the Phase III program in acute pain as well as the phase two results in DPN. We are underway with the Phase II study in LSR and we are continuing to execute our portfolio approach of serial innovation. We are well on our way to helping address the unmet need of 90 million patients suffering with pain.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Stuart.\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nThanks, Reshma. With the recent approvals of CASGEVY in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia in multiple countries and the recent positive results in our pivotal trials for VX-548 in acute pain and for the VANZACAFTOR Triple combination in CF, we are well and truly entering a new era of commercial diversification. As Reshma noted, we delivered strong 4th quarter and full year commercial results in CF, as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFTR modulators. 4th quarter US growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 years old, following the approval for these patients in April.\nOutside the US, we saw continued growth from both label expansions and new reimbursement agreements. In the near-term, we will continue to focus on reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups, which will provide revenue growth. And then we expect to drive further growth with the VANZACAFTOR Triple combination. Given the positive Phase III data we released today that demonstrates a strong benefit-risk profile and the ability to deliver greater restoration of CFTR function than even TRIKAFTA, we believe the VANZACAFTOR Triple combination will be widely welcomed by the CF community, both as a new treatment option for the greater than 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators and as an opportunity for TRIKAFTA patients to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function.\nLonger term, we see additional growth from our mRNA program, VX-522, that we are developing in partnership with Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients with mutations that do not respond to CFTR modulators. In addition, we recently updated our estimate of the number of people living with CF in North America, Europe and Australia to 92,000 from the previous estimate of 88,000. This increase is in large part due to patients living longer as a result of improvements in CF care, including the advent of CFTR modulators. We expect this trend to continue based on the real world evidence we have generated on the clinical benefits of CFTR modulators. And this will also drive long-term growth.\nNow, turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Enthusiasm from patients, physicians and payers is very high around the globe and we are focused on translating the scientific and medical innovation that CASGEVY represents into transformative patient benefit in the real world. In countries where CASGEVY has been approved, our sales reimbursement and access teams, as well as patient engagement teams, have hit the ground running. Let me provide some insights on the early days of the launch.\nStarting with physicians. There is tremendous interest in CASGEVY and what it can do for their patients and we see the impact of that in the rapid activation of authorized treatment centers. Less than two months post-approval, we already have twelve ATCs in the US, three in the EU and one in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all ready to receive patients. Reaction from payers has also been very positive.\nIn the US, across commercial and government payers, all eligible CASGEVY patients have case-by-case coverage through single case agreements. We continue to see excellent progress from payers on the development of their formal medical policies and reimbursement pathways. We have a contract in place with Synergy for up to a 100 million lives and are actively engaged with other commercial payers to finalize medical policies, which would bring the total percentage of covered lives to over 80%.\nIn the government sector, Medicaid state agencies, representing over 60% of sickle cell disease lives, have established reimbursement pathways for CASGEVY, with an additional 25% of Medicaid sickle cell disease lives in states actively progressing their reimbursement methodologies. In addition, we were pleased to have received the January approval in the US for CASGEVY for transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients two and a half months early and are working to achieve a similarly fast trajectory for gaining reimbursement and access for these patients.\nLast week, there was an important update by the Biden administration on the CMMI Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model that was originally announced in February of 2023 and was recently accelerated for implementation from 2026 to 2025. We believe the CMMI CGT Access Model could be an important additional part of access and we now have greater clarity on the scope and process to be employed in the model. The model is intended to provide a comprehensive strategy to address barriers to equitable access to cell and gene therapies for Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as the long-standing inequities of care in the sickle cell disease community.\nLast week's update also confirmed additional federal funding to support access and included a defined scope of manufacturer-provided fertility support in the model, in recognition that for patients choosing to embark on the treatment journey, the cost of fertility preservation are a barrier to access. In the meantime, we continue to actively engage with state Medicaid agencies to finalize medical policies for CASGEVY, even in advance of the CGT Access Model, to ensure patient access without delay.\nOutside the US, we are pleased the French National Authority for Health has approved our request for the implementation of an Early Access Program, or EAP, for TDT patients ages 12 to 35 years. We are delighted to have secured a path to access and payment in France ahead of a national reimbursement agreement and are also in an EAP review process for sickle cell disease patients. In the UK, CASGEVY will be reviewed by the highly specialized Technology Committee in February and we are advancing our reimbursement discussions in other European countries as well.\nWe also see strong progress in the Middle East, which is especially important for CASGEVY given the high prevalence of these diseases in the region and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens. We are working with local health care authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to refine our estimates of the exact number of eligible patients but there are thousands of patients we could serve and we are focused on securing access and reimbursement for them.\nWe have established a local presence in the region, have already activated our first ATC and are working with local healthcare professionals to expand the number of ATCs and establish the required infrastructure to meet patient demand. As we've previously outlined, the CASGEVY patient journey can be broken down into three key phases, each of which can take several months. Pre-treatment, cell collection and manufacturing and then infusion of the edited cells.\nWe are pleased with the early days of what will be a foundational year for CASGEVY as we work to deliver transformative patient outcomes with the possibility of a lifetime of benefit. We look forward to updating you on the CASGEVY launch over the course of this year. To help track our progress, our expectation is to provide quarterly updates on the number of activated ATCs as well as the number of patients in the cell collection phase. ATCs have begun assessing their patients for the ability to be treated with CASGEVY and we expect that the first commercial patients will start the journey in the coming weeks.\nShifting now to VX-548. We are very excited about the potential for this highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to acute pain. As we discussed last week when we shared the results from the pivotal program, we are very excited about VX-548's compelling combination of efficacy and safety; and the demonstration that it can be used for moderate to severe pain across a range of pain conditions, both surgical and non-surgical, and across a range of settings.\nIf approved, VX-548 will be the first of a new class of medicines that inhibit the pain signal and represent the first new class of medicines for acute pain in over 20 years. The reason we're so excited about the potential for VX-548 to positively impact patient care is because we estimate approximately 80 million patients are prescribed medicine for moderate to severe acute pain every year in the US, representing over 1 billion calendar days of treatment. Given this massive patient population, acute pain is a multi-billion dollar market today, despite the fact that essentially all prescriptions are generic.\nWe also see upside to this market opportunity given the significant unmet need that stems from the sub-optimal benefit/risk profiles of existing agents, such as the limited efficacy but acceptable side effects of NSAIDs or the adverse effects and addiction potential of opioids, all of which leads to sub-optimal pain management. What physicians and patients seek is a medicine that combines effective relief of moderate to severe pain, with a clear safety and tolerability profile. And VX-548 delivers on that profile.\nWe've previously shared our go-to-market strategy and we are now actively recruiting our field force in anticipation of our regulatory filing and approval. The commercial team will focus on the roughly 2,000 hospitals and institutions, where a majority of acute pain patients are seen and prescriptions are written. We continue to see a multi-billion dollar opportunity for VX-548 in acute pain alone. The well-known risks of opioids have led to widespread restrictions and limitations on their use over the years.\nIncreasingly, we are seeing a paradigm shift in policy initiatives across various stakeholders to encourage consideration and use of non-opioid alternatives and to remove financial barriers to choosing a branded non-opioid. As an example, late last month, Congress introduced the bipartisan alternatives to Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act or the Alternatives to PAIN Act. If enacted, Medicare Part D plans would be required to set co-pays for non-opioids like VX-548, in line with co-pays for generic opioids, which are typically between $0 and $15.\nThe bill would also prohibit Medicare Part D plans from requiring seniors to step through opioids first or requiring prior authorization for non-opioids. In addition, the NOPAIN Act or Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act, which was enacted in late 2022, provides for an add-on payment for non-opioids in the outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings and remains on track to go into effect in 2025.\nAnd just recently, seven states -- Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia, have pending legislation that would require education on non-opioid options and would remove financial barriers to patient access within state-based health insurance programs like Medicaid. We expect additional states to introduce similar legislation later this year. We believe that these advances in federal and state legislation represent further momentum in Congress and across the US to encourage adoption of and remove any financial barriers to using non-opioid therapies like VX-548.\nIn conclusion, it's an incredibly exciting time at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world and with the VANZA Triple, now have visibility to provide an option for the patients who have discontinued CFTR modulators, as well as the possibility to bring even more patients below diagnostic levels and even to carrier levels of sweat chloride. We're entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY, the first-ever, gene-edited therapy that brings a potential functional cure to patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia across multiple regions. And we are preparing for additional near-term launches with significant market potential, including VX-548 in acute pain.\nI'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles Wagner\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent results in the 4th quarter of 2023 demonstrate, once again, our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. 4th quarter 2023 revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $2.52 billion and was nicely balanced with revenue growth of 8% in the US and 12% outside the US. Full year revenue of $9.87 billion represents 11% growth versus 2022, our ninth consecutive year of at least double digit growth. Overall, the primary drivers of revenue growth in 2023 are in line with our expectations.\n4th quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1 billion compared to $872 million in the 4th quarter of 2022. Included in Q4 '23 results are $18 million of acquired IP R&D charges, compared to $23 million of such charges in the 4th quarter of 2022. Note that with the approval of CASGEVY in the 4th quarter, costs for manufacturing capacity for CASGEVY are now being recorded in cost of goods sold rather than in R&D.\nFull year 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP, R&D and SG&A expenses were $4.24 billion compared to $3.07 billion in 2022. 4th quarter and full year operating expense growth was driven, as expected, by continued investment in research and our pipeline, as we have now advanced assets into the clinic in nine different disease areas. In the 4th quarter and throughout 2023, the most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the pivotal studies for VX-548 in acute pain and the VANZACAFTOR Triple in CF, the Phase 1/2 study for type one diabetes, as well as the build out of capabilities for both our expanding pipeline and our anticipated near-term commercial launches.\nIn addition, approximately $400 million of the year-over-year increase in operating expenses was the result of increased AIP R&D costs from new business development. 4th quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $1.15 billion, consistent with $1.15 billion in non-GAAP operating income in the 4th quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $4.37 billion, compared to 4.79 billion in 2022. 4th quarter 2023 effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects an increase in our 2023 US R&D tax credits. This benefit lowered the Q4 rate and brought the full year 2023 effective tax rate to 19.4%, slightly below our guidance range of 20% to 21%.\n4th quarter 2023 in non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.20, representing 12% growth compared to $3.76 in the 4th quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $15.23, compared to $14.88 in 2022. We ended the quarter with $13.7 billion in cash and investments. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged, as we continue to prioritize investment in innovation including external innovation via business development. During 2023, we completed 10 transactions and recognized over $500 million of AIP R&D. We also deployed over $400 million to repurchase $1.3 million shares over the course of 2023.\nNow, switching to guidance. For 2024, we expect total product revenue in a range of $10.55 to $10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. Included in this outlook is our expectation for continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients, including younger ones, in core markets and select other countries. Guidance also includes contribution from the commercial launch of CASGEVY in approved indications and geographies. We continue to expect a foundational year for CASGEVY in 2024 as we ramp up patient initiations and build toward a multi-billion dollar market opportunity overtime.\nWe're providing total product revenue guidance rather than specifics by disease area or product, given the inherent uncertainty of new launches as well as the significant disparity in size of our established CF business relative to other revenues. As a reminder, on the accounting for CASGEVY and the CRISPR profit share arrangement, Vertex will book 100% of revenues for CASGEVY. The profit share with CRISPR, calculated after product and commercial costs, will be recorded in cost of goods sold. Any ongoing research and development costs will be recorded in operating expenses net of CRISPR's share.\nFor total Vertex operating expenses, we project $4.3 to $4.4 billion in full year 2024, combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D and acquired IP R&D. This operating expense range includes approximately $125 million in currently anticipated IP R&D charges. We continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&D, given the momentum in our multiple mid and late stage clinical development programs. Note that the costs for multiple Phase III studies have been a significant driver of our growth in our total operating expenses in recent years.\nGiven that a number of Phase III studies were completed as entered 2024, we were able to fund new additional Phase III studies without the same rate of growth in operating expenses. While we have substantially completed our commercial investments for CASGEVY, we're also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of other multi-billion dollar opportunities, represented by our programs with near-term launch potential, while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets. With a more normalized impact from US R&D tax credits in 2024, our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%.\nIn closing, Vertex delivered excellent results yet again in 2023, achieving strong revenue growth, important regulatory approvals and commercial launches and positive pivotal trial results that will enable additional near-term launches. We also made progress in our earlier stage pipeline, with proof of concept for VX-548 in neuropathic pain and anticipated advancement of two additional disease areas into the clinic. We also made substantial investments behind our programs and commercial capabilities for near-term launches. As we head into 2024, we anticipate further important milestones -- as highlighted on slide 20 -- to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Charlie. Just to note, given the multiple positive updates this quarter and that's the longer duration of our prepared remarks, we plan to go to about 5:40 this evening. So, it's allowed 30 minutes for your questions. Chuck, please go ahead and assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will begin the question and answer session.

Pharmaceuticals third quarter 2023 conference call, all participants will be in a listen only mode, should you need assistance please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero, after today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions, please note this event is being recorded, I would now like to turn the conference over to Miss Susie Lisa, please go ahead ma'am.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening, all my name is Susie Lisa and as the senior Vice President of Investor Relations it is my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 financial results conference call, on tonight's call making prepared remarks, we have doctor Reshma Kewalramani Vertex's, CEO and President Stuart Arbuckle, Chief operating Officer, and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call, the call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our website, we will make forward looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese statements, including without limitation those regarding Vertex's marketed cystic fibrosis medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions, cctual outcomes and events could differ materially.\nI would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis, in addition, the impact of foreign exchange is presented inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program, I'll now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks Susie, good evening all and thank you for joining us on the call today, we've delivered another strong quarter and continue to drive execution across the company, by reaching more CF patients, third quarter global product revenue grew 6% versus the prior year period, and we are raising full year 2023 CF product revenue guidance to approximately $9.85 billion.\nWe are delivering on our marketed medicines and CF, while simultaneously preparing for commercial excellence in multiple areas ahead of a potential near term launches including exa-cel in both severe sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia, VX-548 for acute pain and longer term in peripheral neuropathic pain, and our Vanzacaftor triple combination therapy for cystic fibrosis.\nMost notably we are tracking towards an exa-cel PDUFA date for sickle cell disease on December 8th of this year and for TDT on March 30th of next year with global regulatory reviews also underway in Europe and the UK, Phase III pivotal trial readouts in early 2024 from both our Vanzacaftor triple in CF and our VX-548 program in acute pain.\nA Phase II trial read out by year end 2023 from our VX-548 trial in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and completion of enrollment in the Phase II portion of the VX-147 Phase 2/3 program in AMKD later this year, with that overview let me now turn to our pipeline update, starting with cystic fibrosis.\nFor our next in class Vanzacaftor triple combination therapy, we remain on track to complete all three Phase III studies SKYLINE 102, and 103 in patients ages 12 years and above and the RIDGELINE study, in patients ages 6 to 11 by the end of 2023 and share results from these three pivotal studies in early 2024.\nWe have high expectations that the Vanzacaftor triple combination can deliver greater improvements in CFTR function than Trikafta based upon the totality of evidence generated to date, including in vitro from our HBE essays and in Phase II studies, the Vanzacaftor riple holds the potential for enhanced clinical benefit versus Trikafta for patients and the convenience of once daily dosing, it also carries a substantially lower royalty burden.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress with another important program in our CF portfolio, VX-522 our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna, for the more than 5,000 CF patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators, we continue to expect to complete the single ascending dose portion and initiate the multiple ascending dose portion of this study by the end of the year.\nTurning now to Exa-cel, our CRISPR-Cas9 based gene-editing program for sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia, this program holds the potential to be a one time functional cure for these debilitating and life shortening diseases, Exa-cel represents an enormous advancement for the estimated 32,000 people living with severe sickle cell disease, and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia across the US and Europe, it is a large commercial opportunity.\nOn the regulatory front in the US, we were very pleased to have had the chance to discuss the Exa-cel filing with members of the FDA Advisory Committee last week and to hear the very compelling stories from patients, the meeting represented a significant milestone for Vertex and the first potential CRISPR-Cas9 based therapeutics, we look forward to our upcoming PDUFA date and to the potential of bringing this precise, durable gene-editing therapy to patients.\nInternationally in both the UK and the EU we are also well into the regulatory review process and expect regulatory decisions in these jurisdictions in the coming months, in addition, we recently submitted a marketing authorization application for Exa-cel to the Saudi Food and Drug Authority or SFDA, I am pleased to share that Exa-cel is the first medicine ever to receive breakthrough designation by the SFDA, reflecting both the high unmet need and the high enthusiasm for Exa-cel in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we look forward to updating you in the coming months.\nMoving on to the pain program and VX-548, our novel highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds the promise for effective pain relief, without the side effects or addictive properties of opioids, and therefore represents a significant commercial opportunity in both acute and neuropathic pain.\nThe pace of the Phase III program in acute pain has been rapid, which we see as an indication of the high unmet need and strong patient and physician interest in an efficacious, non-opioid acute pain therapy, we have completed the randomized control trial in abdominoplasty, the RCT in Bunionectomy and a single arm safety and efficacy study remain on track to complete by the end of this year.\nAs previously discussed we will unblind, analyze and share results on all three studies at the same time and we expect to do so in early 2024, this comprehensive Phase III program has been designed to support a broad, moderate to severe acute pain label and to enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings.\nWe're also studying VX-548 in peripheral neuropathic pain or PNP, Yet another area of high unmet need recall, we previously demonstrated positive proof of concept with the predecessor molecule VX-150 in neuropathic pain, in diabetic peripheral neuropathy or DPN, I am pleased to share that we have completed our Phase II, 12 week, dose ranging proof of concept study.\nWe anticipate sharing the results from this Phase II trial by the end of this year, as we await the DPN results, we're excited to initiate a second, Phase II, peripheral neuropathic pain study of VX-548 by the end of the year in Lumbosacral Radiculopathy or LSR.\nIt's a type of neuropathic pain caused by the impairment of nerve routes in the area of the lumbar spine, given the limited therapeutic options, the significant opportunity to serve a large number of patients and the promise that the NaV1.8 mechanism holds, we are excited to pursue the potential of VX-548 in each of these neuropathic pain types.\nNext onto type 1 diabetes, where we are evaluating stem-cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin producing islet cells for people with type 1 diabetes, our goal is to develop a potential, one time, functional cure for the millions of people living with type 1 diabetes, including the more than 2.5 million patients in North America, and Europe alone.\nThe VX-880, or naked cell program, where we've already established proof of concept, is foundational to the type 1 diabetes program as a whole, here patients take standard immunosuppressants to protect the islet cells from the immune system, at EASD last month, we presented positive updated clinical data from all patients in parts, A and B of the VX-880 study.\nWith regard to study status, part C of the study, which administers the full target dose with concurrent dosing is now fully enrolled, our second program VX-264, or the cells + device program, encapsulates the same cells in a proprietary immunoprotective device and hence, there is no requirement for Immunosuppressants, we have begun enrollment and dosing in part A of the VX-264 study, and finally, our third program, still under research stage is our hypoimmune cells, in which we added the same fully differentiate cells so as to obviate the need for Immunosuppressants.\nTransitioning now to Inaxaplin or VX-147, the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD, the Inaxaplin pivotal program for patients with AMKD is a single, adaptive Phase 2/3 study with a pathway to accelerated approval in the US, the Phase 2b dose ranging portion of the study continues to enroll and dose patients and we expect to complete enrollment by the end of this year, we now expect to select a dose and move to Phase III of the study in Q1 of 2024.\nNow turning to Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AATD, we have discontinued development of VX-864 due to non-serious rash events in some patients in the Phase II program, our next generation molecules VX-634, and VX-668, both have greater potency and better drug-like properties and are both in Phase I clinical trials, these trials continue to enroll and dose healthy volunteers, we look forward to sharing more on AATD, including next steps as we learn more in the coming months, with that I'll turn it over to Stuart Thanks.\n\nStuart Arbuckle\n\nThanks Reshma, I will focus my remarks tonight on CF, Exa-cel and Pain, we delivered strong third quarter commercial results with CF product revenue growing 6% globally versus the prior year, as we continued to reach patients in younger age groups as a result of new regulatory approvals and via new reimbursement agreements.\nOur strategy in CF has always been to develop medicines for all people living with CF and to serially innovate to deliver increased clinical benefit, we will continue to execute near term with a focus on younger age groups and then our goal is to drive growth over the medium term with the Vanzacaftor triple combination and longer term with our mRNA program VX-522 that we are developing in partnership with Moderna.\nNow turning to Exa-cel, our next targeted launch and potential multibillion dollar opportunity, this quarter I will provide some insights as to launch readiness ahead of potential near term regulatory approvals and then detail the patient journey, in the U S and Europe, we've previously highlighted that there are approximately 32,000 eligible patients with severe disease, 25,000 with sickle cell disease and 7000 with Beta thalassemia.\nThe majority of sickle cell disease patients are in the US While the majority of TDT patients are in Europe, within Europe, approximately 75% of all eligible patients live in four countries, the UK, France, Italy, and Germany, Italy has by far the highest prevalence of eligible TDT patients, while France and the UK represent the majority of eligible patients with sickle cell disease.\nIn the US and Europe, we are on track with our globally-enabled supply network and launch preparations with authorized treatment centers and payers, including our recently completed application for a new technology add-on payment or NTAP for Medicare patients in the US.\nIn addition, Reshma mentioned our exa-cel MAA submission in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or KSA, our team is engaging with the Saudi Health authorities and working on the processes to support ATC activation, access and reimbursement with the aim of bringing Exa-cel to the thousands of patients with severe disease in KSA, we look forward to providing you with more information on future calls about this important additional opportunity.\nAs we prepare for approval and launch, it is important to understand the Exa-cel patient journey, which can be broken down into three key phases, each of which can take several months, first pre-treatment, initially when a potential Exa-cel patient and their Hematologists decide the therapy is right for them, the patient is then referred to a transplant physician at an ATC, once that referral is scheduled the patient then undergoes a full workup to determine whether they are fit for treatment with Exa-cel.\nSecond cell collection and manufacturing, this phase involves mobilization to move the blood stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood, where the cells can be collected through apheresis, the patient cells are then sent to our manufacturing facilities, where they are edited and then tested for quality control.\nCell collection takes longer for sickle cell disease patients, given the need for two months of Red blood cell transfusions prior to mobilization and ,on average, two rounds of mobilization and apheresis, in contrast TDT patients do not require pre-mobilization transfusions and typically only require one round of mobilization and apheresis.\nThe final phase is treatment, once the edited cells are ready the patient starts the treatment phase, which includes Myeloablative conditioning, infusion of the edited cells, at which point we will recognize revenue for the therapy and then waiting for engraftment and post-infusion care, a critical time and factor in this phase is the patient's preferred timing for treatment as they must choose a time that works best for their lives, given this step involves an approximate one month hospital stay.\nThis patient journey is consistent across all geographies, given the multiple steps and the duration of the journey, we expect 2024 to be a foundational year for Exa-cel, as the first patients begin this journey and Vertex works to deliver transformative patient outcomes with the possibility of a lifetime of benefit.\nShifting now to VX-548, our highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor for pain, given the programs rapid pace of clinical advancement, we have developed our go to market strategies and are actively planning for a potential near term launch, I'd like to share an outline of some of the work we've done to size each market opportunity.\nOverall, the pain opportunity is massive, in the US alone each year more than 90 million patients are treated for acute or peripheral neuropathic pain, both acute and PNP are each multibillion dollar markets today, despite the fact that essentially all prescriptions are generic and we see additional upside to these opportunities given the challenges of currently approved treatments.\nThe unmet need in pain stems from the sub-optimal benefit risk profiles of existing agents, such as the adverse effects in addiction potential of opioids and the lack of consistent efficacy for anticonvulsants like the Gabapentinoids prescribed for neuropathic pain.\nWe believe the innovation of VX-548, and its overall profile could provide a transformative option for millions of patients, in acute pain, we estimate approximately 80 million patients are prescribed medicines for their moderate to severe acute pain every year in the US.\nMore than two thirds of patients receive acute pain treatment driven by an institution, either during a hospital or ambulatory surgery center visit or at discharge, as hospital-driven prescribing is concentrated amongst some 2,000 hospitals, and 200 IDNs we can reach a large proportion of the patient opportunity with a specialty sales force.\nAs Reshma mentioned, the peripheral neuropathic pain study in DPN is completed and the LSR study is about to begin, PNP is an exciting commercial opportunity, given that approximately 10 million patients are prescribed a medicine for a PNP condition every year in the US, with chronic dosing, but limited treatment options.\nPNP fits our vertex specialty model perfectly, PNP is a collection of chronic conditions in which nerve impairment causes pain, DPN and LSR are two of the largest patient segments, LSR represents over 40% of all PNP patients while DPN represents approximately 20% of all PNP patients.\nSpecialists play a critical role in treating PNP, as patients can be on multiple treatments and are often in search of more effective pain control, given the limited therapeutic options, therefore, we believe the PNP segment is addressable with a specialty sales force and we look forward to bringing innovation to PNP patients.\nIn conclusion, it's an exciting time at Vertex, we continued to make progress treating more CF patients and are on the verge of bringing a potential functional cure to patients with sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia with Exa-cel, we're also preparing for multiple additional near term launches, including the Vanzacaftor triple in CF and VX-548 in acute pain, both of which have the potential to dramatically improve patients' lives and represent significant market opportunities for Vertex.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles Wagner\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks Stuart, Vertex's excellent results in the third quarter of 2023 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile, third quarter 2023 revenue increased 6% year over year to $2.48 billion, US revenue grew 7% year over year following the recent FDA approval of Trikafta in patients ages 2 to 5 and outside the US, revenue grew 6% year over year on continued strong uptake of Trikafta/Kaftrio in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions in younger age groups.\nAs anticipated in Q3, we saw the drawdown of inventory in certain international markets, in contrast to the increases in inventory that we experienced in the first half of the year, year to date revenue of $7.35 billion represents 11% growth over the corresponding prior year period, including an approximate 150 basis point headwind from changes in foreign currency, overall the primary drivers of revenue growth in 2023 have been in line with our expectations.\nThird quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $993 million, compared to $758 million in the third quarter of '22, Q3 2023 results include $52 million of acquired IPR&D charges, compared to $29 million of such charges in the third quarter of 2022.\nOperating expense growth was driven, as expected, by continued investment in research and our pipeline, throughout 2023 the most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year, included the clinical studies for VX-548 in acute pain, the Vanzacaftor triple in CF and for type one diabetes as well as build out of capabilities for our expanding pipeline.\nIn addition, we continued our pre-commercial activities for exa-cel and other anticipated near term launches, third quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $1.17 billion compared to $1.29 billion in the third quarter of 2022, third quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.08, representing 2% growth compared to $4.01 in the third quarter of 2022.\nWe ended the quarter with $13.6 billion in cash and investments, our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged as we continue to prioritize investment in innovation, including external innovation via business development, year to date, we have completed nearly 10 transactions with total consideration of over $500 million, we've also continued to allocate cash to share repurchases and year to date, we have spent approximately $285 million to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares.\nNow switching to guidance, given our strong year to date results and our consistent execution, we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance as detailed on slide 17, for the full year 2023 we now expect CF Net product revenue of approximately $9.85 billion versus our prior range of $9.7 to $9.8 billion, note that this revenue guidance continues to include an expected approximate 150 basis point headwind to our revenue growth rate from changes in foreign currency.\nWe are maintaining our 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses in a range of $4.1 to $4.2 billion, we continue to invest the majority of our operating expenses into R&D given the momentum in our multiple mid and late stage clinical development programs.\nWe are also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of the multibillion dollar opportunities represented by our programs with near term launch potential while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets due to an increase in our current year US R&D tax credit estimate we are lowering guidance for our projected full year 2023, non-GAAP effective tax rate by 100 basis points to a range of 20% to 21% versus the prior range of 21% to 22%.\nIn closing Vertex delivered excellent results yet again in Q3 '23 achieving strong revenue growth, important regulatory milestones, continued clinical trial progress and ongoing investments both internally and externally, as we continued to advance our programs to closeout 2023 and head into 2024, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on slide 18 to Mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas, we look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session, to ask a question you may

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Susie Lisa, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening, everyone. My name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 financial results conference call. [indiscernible] call making prepared remarks. We have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed cystic fibrosis medicines our pipeline and Vertex's future financial management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.\nI would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange is presented inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.\nI'll now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening, all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. After a strong start to the year, we saw continued momentum into the second quarter across all aspects of the company. Our CF business continues to grow, and we are reaching more patients than ever. In the second quarter, this expanded reach drove 14% [indiscernible] product revenue growth versus the prior year period. And with this first half performance, we are raising our full year 2023 CF product revenue guidance to a revised range of $9.7 billion to $9.8 billion.\nAs we continue to deliver in CF, we're also investing for future commercial excellence, ahead of multiple potential near-term launches. In exa-cel in both severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, which we expect will be the first in our next wave of launches. In VX-548 for acute pain, another multibillion-dollar commercial opportunity and in our vanzacaftor triple combination therapy for cystic fibrosis, which provides the opportunity to further extend our leadership in CF.\nIn addition to these 4 disease areas, our mid-stage clinical pipeline continues to develop rapidly and marked progress towards our 5 launches in [indiscernible] include: the VX-147 oranaxipin pivotal trial remains on track to complete the Phase IIb portion of the study by the end of this year. In our type 1 diabetes program, both VX-880, the naked cells and VX-264, the cells plus device programs are now in the clinic and dosing patients.\nAdditionally, we announced a strategic long-term manufacturing agreement with Lonza for our type 1 diabetes cell therapy programs. And finally, an accelerated time line for the VX-548 Phase II study in peripheral neuropathic pain, where we now expect the study to complete by the end of 2023. In total, we're advancing programs in 8 disease areas through mid- and late-stage development, 6 of which are now past the proof-of-concept stage as detailed on Slide 5.\nBeyond our clinical pipeline, we're also advancing the next wave of research stage assets, reflecting programs sourced from both internal and external innovation. This includes programs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1, the NaV1.7 program for pain and jetlag conditioning agents for use with exa-cel. In the CF franchise, in R&D and across the business, this quarter, Vertex has continued to make meaningful advancements to bring our CFTR portfolio to more patients around the globe and bring additional first-in-class or best-in-class potentially transformative medicines to multiple new disease areas.\nWith that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&D progress, starting with CF. While TRIKAFTA delivers tremendous benefit for patients. If it's possible to do better, we're committed to being the ones who do so, and that is the goal for our next-in-class vanzecaftor triple combination therapy. I am pleased to share we expect to complete all 3 Phase III studies, SKYLINE 102 and 103 in patients ages 12 years and above and the RIDGELINE study in patients ages 6 to 11 by the end of 2023 and release results from these 3 studies in early '24.\nWe have high expectations from the vanzacaftor triple program to lead to further improvements in CFTR function based on the totality of the evidence generated to date. The most direct readout of higher CFTR function is chloride transport in vitro and sweat chloride in patients. In vitro, our human bronchial epithelial cell assays with the vanzacaftor triple showed greater restoration of chloride transport than with TRIKAFTA. And in Phase II in patients the vanzacaftor triple clinical studies showed correspondingly lower levels of sweat chloride than in previous studies with Trikafta, We, therefore, believe the vanzacaftor triple has the potential to provide patients with enhanced clinical benefit, the convenience of once-daily dosing. And additionally, the Vans Triple carries a substantially lower royalty burden.\nAnother important program in our CF portfolio is VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. We have enthusiasm for this approach for 3 key reasons, based on what we've achieved to date: first, the delivery of mRNA at high efficiency into HBE cells in vitro; second, expression of CFTR protein leading to high levels of chloride transport; and third, successful delivery of mRNA in both small and small and [indiscernible] expression of CFTR protein in the desired cells.\nWe continue to enroll and dose CF patients in the single ascending dose or SAD study of VX-522. And we expect to complete the SAD portion and initiate the multiple ascending dose portion of the study this year.\nTurning now to exa-cel, our CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing program for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, which targets the most severe patients and an estimated patient population of approximately 32,000. Exa-cel holds the promise to be a onetime functional cure for these diseases.\nOn the regulatory front, the FDA has accepted our filings and granted priority review in sickle cell disease with the December 8 PDUFA date. Along with a standard review in beta thalassemia with the March 30, 2024 PDUFA date. The FDA has indicated an advisory committee will be held, and we look forward to the opportunity to discuss the high unmet need, share results from the exa-cel studies and discuss the transformative potential exa-cel holds for patients.\nOutside the U.S., in the EU and the U.K., reviews for our exa-cel filings are also well underway. Our oral presentation, the most recent EHA meeting in June, provided new data that were the basis of the EMA and MHRA regulatory filings. Both trials met the primary and key secondary endpoints with follow-up in some patients of more than 36 months.\nThe exa-cel EHA results continue to demonstrate transformative, consistent and durable benefit for patients as measured by freedom from severe vaso-occlusive crises for 94% of SCD patients, and transfusion independence in 89% of TDT patients. The safety profile was generally consistent with busulfan conditioning and bone marrow transplantation.\nAnother significant opportunity for exa-cel is in younger patients, and the pediatric trials in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia are underway. We have enrolled more than half the target number of patients in both pediatric studies and have dosed multiple patients. This is an important area of focus given the opportunity to intervene earlier and potentially prevent organ damage and other complications before they ever occur. As the PDUFA dates approach in the U.S. and reviews come to conclusion in the U.K. and EU, we look forward to bringing this onetime potentially curative therapy to thousands of patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.\nTurning next to our pain program and VX-548, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds the promise of effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive properties of opioids. In acute pain, I am pleased to share that all 3 Phase III studies, 2 randomized controlled trials and a single-arm safety and efficacy study will complete by the end of this year, with results available in late 2023 or early '24.\nThe pace of this Phase III program has been rapid which we see as indicative of the high unmet need and strong interest in an efficacious, non-opioid acute pain therapy. We have high confidence in the outlook for these Phase III studies given: one, the genetic and pharmacologic validation of the target; two, multiple proof-of-concept trials with the predecessor molecule and with VX-548 itself; and three, the similar methodology, design and endpoints of our Phase III studies compared to the Phase II program.\nClosing on acute pain, recall that the Phase III program has been designed to support a broad, moderate-to-severe acute pain label, which would enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings, including in hospital or the ambulatory surgical center post-discharge and in the home.\nWe are also studying VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy or DPN. A type of peripheral neuropathic pain that represents yet another significant area of unmet need and another multibillion-dollar market opportunity. We have previously delivered positive proof-of-concept data in peripheral neuropathic pain with the predecessor molecule VX-150.\nThe current study in DPN with VX-548 is a 12-week Phase II dose-ranging proof-of-concept study. I am pleased to share the time line for this DPN study has accelerated and we have recently completed enrollment. This study will complete by the end of this year, and we expect to share results in late 2023 or early '24.\nMoving now to type 1 diabetes, where we're evaluating stem cell-derived, fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells for people with type 1 diabetes. Our goal is to develop a functional cure for the millions of people living with type 1 diabetes, including the more than 2.5 million patients in North America and Europe alone.\nThe VX-880 program is our foundational cell therapy program for T1D in which we have already demonstrated proof of concept. In the VX-880 trial or the naked cell program, patients take standard immunosuppressants to protect the islets from the immune system. We presented updated clinical data on Parts A and B of the study at the recent American Diabetes Association Meeting. The presentation at the ADA showed that all 6 patients treated with VX-880 engrafted islet cells produced endogenous insulin and had improved glycemic control while reducing or eliminating exogenous insulin use.\nImportantly, the 2 patients with at least 1 year follow-up saw a complete elimination of severe hypoglycemic events, maintained hemoglobin A1Cs below 7% and were insulin independent. Further, patients who were earlier on their course of therapy were on a similar trajectory as the 2 patients with long-term follow-up. Based on these results, the VX-880 trial has now advanced to Part C, where patients are treated concurrently at the full target dose. And as part of our global study plan, we've now opened clinical trial sites in Europe in addition to those already open in the U.S. and Canada.\nOur second program, VX-264, the cells plus device program encapsulates these same cells, which have already demonstrated proof of concept in a proprietary immunoprotective device. And hence, there is no requirement for immunosuppressants. I am pleased to share that enrollment in the VX-264 study has initiated and we have already dosed the first patient.\nThe third program is our hyperimmune program in which we edit the same fully differentiated cells to cloak them from the immune system. This represents another path to obviating the need for immunosuppressants. In March, we expanded our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics into type 1 diabetes to use CRISPR/Cas9 to make these edits, and we continue to make progress in this research stage program.\nTransitioning now to inaxaplin or VX-147, and the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AKD, a genetically defined disease that affects approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe alone. Recall the inaxiplin pivotal program for [indiscernible] single adaptive Phase II/III study with a pathway to accelerate approval in the U.S. The Phase IIb dose-ranging portion of the study continues to enroll and dose and remains on track to complete this year.\nWe also continue to work to enhance AMKD disease awareness and genetic testing availability to support diagnosis, including through partnerships with Natera, a leader in genetic testing and Arcana, a leader in renal pathology services.\nTo close an update on our Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AATD program, our small molecule approach to stations of this disease that affects an estimated 100,000 people in North America and Europe. Our program is exploring 2 hypotheses: first, longer treatment duration with VX-864; and second, a more potent molecule with VX-634.\nThe Phase II program for VX-864, a 48-week study in patients with AATD that assesses both liver clearance of Z polymer and functional plasma AAT levels is ongoing and is anticipated to complete enrollment later this year. VX-634, the next-in-class molecule with multifold greater potency and better drug-like properties is projected to complete its Phase I trial by the end of this year. Overall, the AATD program remains on track, and we look forward to sharing results in 2024.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Stuart to provide a commercial update, including details on our launch preparations for exa-cel.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Reshma. From a commercial perspective, we had strong second quarter results as we continue our focus on reaching all patients eligible for our CFTR modulators and maintaining high levels of adherence for patients treated with our medicines.\nIn addition, we continue to prepare for multiple potential near-term launches, including exa-cel in severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia VX-548 in moderate to severe acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF. At the same time, we are developing new capabilities to support the commercialization of other pipeline assets. such as disease awareness for AMKD and investing in our manufacturing capabilities for type 1 diabetes.\nGiven our nearest term opportunity is exa-cel in hemoglobinopathies where we have completed our regulatory filings in Europe and the U.S. and also being granted PDUFA dates in the U.S. This quarter, I will focus my comments about our pipeline on prelaunch activities for exa-cel.\nBut briefly first on CF. At the beginning of this year, there were more than 20,000 people with CF in North America, Europe and Australia, who could benefit, but were not yet being treated with a CFTR modulator. We continue to bring our medicines to these patients through new approvals and uptake following additional reimbursements with a focus on reaching younger patients, and this will continue to be a driver of near-term growth for our business.\nSecond quarter 2023 CF revenue growth of 14% was consistent with this outlook and was driven primarily by expanded use of our medicines in younger age groups. Following U.S. TRIKAFTA approval in children ages 2 to 5 in late April, we've seen strong interest from the CF community with the first prescription written just hours after the approval and uptake across all eligible patients.\nOutside the U.S., KAFTRIO growth has continued to be strong in patient ages 16 and older, following approval, reimbursement and successful launches in multiple geographies. In addition, we received EU approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 1 to 2 in early July, and we continue to expect approval for KAFTRIO in the EU in children ages 2 to 5 by the end of this year. We are also actively enrolling our KAFTRIO study in children ages 1 to 2.\nOverall, we see continued growth for our portfolio of CFTR modulators, driven by approvals, reimbursement and uptake of our medicines in younger patients. In addition, approvals of future CF medicines will also drive growth. Notably, our next-generation vanzacaftor triple seeks to provide improved efficacy for patients and a new treatment option for those who have discontinued prior CFTR modulator therapy. And longer term, VX-522, our mRNA approach could offer a therapy for the more than 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.\nShifting now to exa-cel, which holds curative potential for patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, both chronic diseases that can be disabling and life-shortening and have an extremely high burden of care.\nOn previous quarterly earnings calls, I provided details for exa-cel on the estimated eligible patient population, geographic concentration of those patients and our proposed ATC network of 50 centers in the U.S. and 25 in Europe. The hiring and training of our field and medical education teams and insights from physician and patient market research.\nThis quarter, I'd like to provide our perspective on access and reimbursement and our discussions globally with payers and policymakers. Our teams continue to make excellent progress in pre-approval discussions with both government and commercial payers in the U.S. and Europe. With more than a dozen cell and gene therapies on the market, payers across different channels are increasingly experienced with these transformative types of therapies.\nIn the U.S., approximately 65% of patients with sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia, have coverage through government programs with the majority via Medicaid, and the remaining 35% of patients are covered by private insurance. Our teams have already engaged Medicaid administrators in all 50 states with a particular focus on the 24 states with the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease, accounting for an estimated 90% of Medicaid patients with SCD.\nWe're encouraged by the enthusiasm from state Medicaid administrators for exa-cel as well as the proactive steps they are taking to prepare for the availability of therapies like exa-cel including the enablement of separate payment policies for coverage of the cost of the therapy, distinct from the cost of the bone marrow transplant procedure.\nThe Medicaid-focused CMS cell and gene therapy access model also continues to make progress towards its anticipated launch in 2026. The model is clear evidence of the federal government's recognition of the potential transformative value of gene therapies like exa-cel to treat sickle cell disease and their interest in finding innovative payment solutions and pathways for state Medicaid programs.\nShifting to commercial payers. We have had high levels of engagement with commercial payers, including the top 4 payers that account for approximately 80% of commercial lives. And our goal is to facilitate timely coverage decisions upon a potential exa-cel approval. Our pre-approval discussions have been encouraging and are focused on disease burden, epidemiology estimates, our clinical data and potential payment models.\nIn Europe, the MAA reviews are well underway and thus, we are also working on paving the way to secure reimbursed access for patients in our targeted European markets. We have been engaging with health systems to educate them on the significant disease burden on patients, health care systems and society. In addition, we have been meeting with European health authorities to understand their interest in different payment models and to communicate the holistic value of a onetime potential functional cure.\nGiven the urgent unmet need for new treatments for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, there is significant interest from patients and physicians, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of the eligible patient population.\nTo conclude, it's a remarkable time to be at Vertex. We continue to make progress treating more CF patients, while our excitement for the transformative promise of exa-cel for patients and the resulting multibillion-dollar market opportunity continues to grow as we approach potential approval.\nWe are also preparing for multiple additional near-term launches, including the vanzacafta triple in CF and VX-548 in acute pain, both of which have the potential to dramatically improve patients' lives.\nI'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent results in the second quarter of 2023 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Second quarter 2023 revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $2.49 billion. Growth was led by a 26% year-over-year increase outside the U.S. on continued strong uptake of TRIKAFTA-KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions in younger age groups.\nSimilarly, expansion in younger age groups helped drive 7% U.S. revenue growth following the recent FDA approval of TRIKAFTA in patients ages 2 to 5. Second quarter and first half revenues also benefited from increases in channel inventory in certain international markets, which are expected to draw down in the second half.\nSecond quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.04 billion compared to $750 million in the second quarter of 2022. Q2 2023 results include $110 million of acquired IP R&D charges compared to $62 million of such charges in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023, IP R&D expense reflects a $70 million milestone to CRISPR Therapeutics for progress made in our hypoimmune program for type 1 diabetes.\nAside from our investments in external innovation and the resulting higher acquired IP R&D charges, operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research and our advancing pipeline, which includes mid- and late-stage clinical assets across 8 different disease areas.\nThe most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the clinical studies for the vanzacaftor Triple-NCF for VX-548 in acute pain and for type 1 diabetes. In addition, we continued our pre-commercial activities for exa-cel and other anticipated near-term launches, given the potentially transformative benefits to patients and multibillion-dollar market opportunities for our mid- and late-stage programs, we will continue to invest appropriately.\nSecond quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $1.15 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.89, representing 8% growth compared to $3.60 in the second quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in cash and investments.\nNow switching to guidance. Given our strong first half results and our consistent execution, including the successful launch of TRIKAFTA in patients ages 2 to 5 in the U.S., we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance as detailed on [indiscernible] for the full year 2023, we now expect CF net product revenue of $9.7 billion to $9.8 billion, an increase of $100 million to $150 million compared to our prior range of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion. Note that this revenue guidance includes an expected approximate 150 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth rate, consistent with our prior expectations.\nIn addition, given our December 8 U.S. PDUFA date for exa-cel and sickle cell disease, 2023 product revenue guidance continues to reflect revenue from cystic fibrosis products only. We are also raising our 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses to a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, an increase of $200 million from prior guidance.\nThis increase reflects higher IP R&D expenses from new business development, including collaborations with Entrada in DM1 and with CRISPR in type 1 diabetes. Our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance now includes approximately $500 million of upfronts and milestones compared to the $300 million projected at the start of the year.\nWe continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&D, given the momentum in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs. We are also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of the multibillion dollar opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets. Our guidance for projected full year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22% is unchanged.\nIn closing, Vertex delivered excellent results for the second quarter of 2023. We delivered strong revenue growth, completed important regulatory milestones, updated on significant clinical trial programs and invested internally and externally. As we continue to advance our programs in 2023, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on Slide 17 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Charlie. Gary, can you please view the first question?",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nMy name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 financial results conference Call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed cystic fibrosis medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange is presented inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. I will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We're pleased to have opened with a strong start to 2023 as first quarter global CF product revenues grew 13% versus the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we completed the exa-cel U.S. rolling BLA submissions for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia and secured U.S. approval for TRIKAFTA in patients 2 to 5 years of age. Now is an especially exciting time at Vertex because within our 5 launches in 5 years or 5 in 5 goal, we see multiple programs with near-term launch potential, including exa-cel in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, the vanzacaftor triple in CF, and VX-548 for acute pain. In total, we now have programs in 8 disease areas in mid- and late-stage development six of which are past the proof-of-concept stage as depicted on Slide 5.\nWith this breadth of compelling opportunities, we're investing accordingly to drive continued pipeline success, clinical trial progress and the build-out of commercialization capabilities. In addition, beyond the 8 disease areas already in the clinic, the next wave of innovation is advancing through preclinical development including programs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type I, NAV 1.7 for pain and gentler conditioning agents for use with exa-cel. -- with a uniquely strong and durable CF franchise, multiple near-term commercial opportunities, a broad and rapidly advancing pipeline a strong balance sheet and an exceptionally talented and committed team, Vertex has never been as well positioned to deliver for patients and shareholders for years to come.\nWith that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&D progress, starting with CF. Our next-in-class vanzacaftor triple combination has completed enrollment in its 2 Phase III clinical trials in patients ages 12 years and above, known as Skyline 102 and 103, and is progressing well.\nEnrollment in patients ages 6 to 11 known as the Ridgeline study is also advancing rapid. We continue to anticipate the completion of the Skyline studies by the end of this year, and I'm pleased to share we now project the completion of the Ridgeline study at approximately the same time as the Skyline studies.\nRecognizing the very high bar set by TRIKAFTA, we have high expectations for the Vanzacaftor triple program based on the totality of the evidence generated to date, and as was recently reported in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Preclinically, our HBE assays, which have consistently proven to have robust translation from the bench into the clinic showed greater restoration of chloride transport with the vanzacaftor triple than with Trikafta. In the Phase II clinical program, the vanzacaftor triple drove greater CFTR function and correspondingly lower levels of sweat chloride that has been seen with TRIKAFTA. As such, we believe the vanzacaftor triple has the potential for enhanced clinical benefit along with the convenience of once-daily dosing. In addition, we expect the vanzacaftord tripple to carry a substantially lower royalty burden. Another important study in our CF portfolio pertains to VX-522. Our CFTR mRNA therapy that we're developing in partnership with Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.\nWe have initiated the single ascending dose or SAD study of VX-522 and are actively enrolling and dosing CF patients. We anticipate completing the SAD portion of the study and initiating the multiple ascending dose portion of the study this year.\nTurning now to exa-cel. Our gene editing program for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Exa-cel holds the potential to be the first CRISPR-based gene editing treatment to be approved as well as the promise to be a onetime functional cure for these diseases. This is our most advanced program outside of CF, and we expect exa-cel to be our next commercial launch.\nPer our prior guidance, we completed our BLA submissions for both sickle cell disease and TDT in the U.S. at the end of last quarter. We now await acceptance of our filings and assignment of the PDUFA date. Our filings include requests for priority review, which if granted, will result in an 8-month review by FDA from the time of submission.\nInternationally, as previously announced, both the EMA and MHRA have validated our exa-cel MAA submissions and those filings are under review. We see a significant opportunity for exa-cel. Stuart will comment further on the market opportunity and our launch preparations in just a few minutes.\nTurning next to our pain program and VX-548, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds the promise of effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive properties of opioids. We have confidence in the outlook for this program, given: one, NaV1.8 is a genetically and pharmacologically validated target. Two, we have multiple positive proof-of-concept results with our predecessor NaV1.8 inhibitor, VX-150, across acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. And with VX 548 itself in acute pain. And three, our Phase III program with VX-548 in acute pain is substantially similar to the positive Phase II trials we have already concluded. VX 548 has been granted fast track and breakthrough therapy designations for acute pain in the U.S. We initiated pivotal development last year and enrollment in dosing across the 3 Phase III studies continue to progress nicely. These studies have been designed to support our goal of a broad moderate to severe acute pain label that would enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings, including at the site of care, post-discharge and in the home.\nWe continue to anticipate completing the acute pain Phase III pivotal program towards the end of this year or beginning of next. Creating another potentially significant and near-term commercial opportunity. In addition, we continue to enroll in dose patients in a 12-week Phase II dose-ranging proof-of-concept study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain. I'm pleased to share we also anticipate completing this Phase II study towards the end of this year or beginning of next.\nTransitioning now to anaxaplin, or VX-147, the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD. In March, we were very pleased with the publication of the Phase II results for enaxipline in the New England Journal of Medicine. Importantly, the paper was accompanied by an editorial and a feature on the science behind the study. We see this coverage in the New England Journal of Medicine as underscoring the importance of the enaxaplin data and the medicines potential. The Phase IIb dose-ranging portion of the global Phase II/III pivotal study remains on track to complete this year. Recall, this study has a preplanned interim analysis at 48 weeks of treatment which, if positive, could serve as the basis to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. With enaxiplin, we see the potential to bring a first-in-class treatment to the approximately 100,000 patients with AMKD in the U.S. and Europe and unlock a multibillion-dollar market opportunity. Moving now to type 1 diabetes. There are more than 2.5 million people with type 1 diabetes in North America and Europe alone, and we are committed to delivering a transformative, if not curative medicine for this disease. We have 3 programs in our type 1 diabetes portfolio, all of which use the same fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells, which have already demonstrated proof of concept.\nOur first program, or VX-880, the naked cell program uses standard immunosuppressives to protect the islet cells from the immune system. I am pleased to share that both Part A and Part B of the study are now fully enrolled and dosed -- in both portions of the study, dosing of patients was staggered with Part A patients receiving half dose and Part B patients receiving the full target dose. The next step in the program is Part C, in which patients will be treated concurrently with the full target dose. This should facilitate faster time lines.\nWe look forward to sharing VX-880 data for more patients and with longer duration of follow-up at medical congresses this year. including the ADA scientific sessions in June. Our second program, VX-264 or the Sells device program encapsulates these same cells in a proprietary device that is designed to shield the cells from the body's immune system. And hence, there is no requirement for immunosuppressants. Both the IND in the U.S. and the CTA in Canada have cleared. Site activation and study initiation activities are underway in both the U.S. and Canada, and we look forward to enrolling and dosing patients in this Phase I/II study in the near term.\nThird, our hyperimmune program in which we edit the same cells to clock them from the immune system. This would represent another path to obviating the need for immunosuppressives. In March, we expanded our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics into type 1 diabetes, and this new licensing agreement will enable us to use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the cells. This research stage program continues to make progress. Lastly, also in the T1D portfolio, the Viacyte-VCTX-211 Hybo immune program using Aviate cell line remains on track. This program is finished enrollment and dosing in group 1 of the Phase I/II study. Let me conclude with our Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AATD program, which continues to enroll both the Phase II study for VX-864 and the Phase I study for VX-634, the Phase II program for VX-864 is a 48-week study in patients with AATD that will assess both liver clearance of Z polymer and serum functional AAT levels. This study is projected to complete enrollment later this year. The Phase I healthy volunteer study of VX 634, the next-in-class molecule with multi-fold greater potency and better drug-like properties is projected to complete this year. With that, I'll now turn over the call to Stuart.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Reshma. From a commercial perspective, our focus continues to be to reach all patients eligible for our CFTR modulators and maintain high levels of adherence among patients already on therapy. While also preparing for potential near-term launches for exa-cel, VX-548 in acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF. I'll first review our CF first quarter commercial results and then the longer-term outlook for our CF portfolio. I will then comment on the exa-cell opportunity and our launch preparations given that we have now completed our regulatory filings in the U.S., Europe and the U.K. We had a strong first quarter with growth predominantly driven by bringing our medicines to younger patients. including TRIKAFTA in children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., plus Europe and Canada, and we remain confident in the growth outlook for 2023.\nLast week, as expected, we received FDA approval for TRIKAFTA in the U.S. for children ages 2 to 5 years, which adds approximately 900 new patients, who, for the first time, will have a treatment to address the underlying cause of their disease.\nTurning to the longer-term outlook. We see continued growth in CF beyond 2023. As Reshma mentioned, at the beginning of this year, there were more than 20,000 people in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand with CF who could benefit, but were not yet being treated with our approved medicines. Beyond the key growth driver of reaching younger patients through new approvals, we also continue to make progress in securing additional reimbursements.\nThis includes multiple agreements spanning our CF portfolio for younger patients in Europe and most recently, also Australia and New Zealand. A second driver of CF product growth is the compelling portfolio of real-world outcome studies, including model data which validate the positive outlook for long-term growth in the overall CF population due to improved survival. Model data related to projected survival and long-term health outcomes were recently published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis. And include a 33.5 year increase in median projected survival with TRIKAFTA therapy versus the standard of care. A third growth driver for our CF portfolio will be our next-generation vanzacaftor triple, which provides an opportunity to bring a new and potentially improved treatment option to patients including those who discontinued therapy with our other medicines.\nWe estimate that there are approximately 6,000 patients who have discontinued 1 of our existing CFTR modulators. And longer term, a fourth factor to help drive extended growth in our CF portfolio is VX-522, which is designed to provide mRNA therapy for the more than 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.\nShifting now to exa-cel, which holds curative potential for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. With the recent completion of our exa-cel regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and U.K., our commercial teams are preparing for the potential approval and launch of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. Sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are neither silent nor undiagnosed diseases. Our initial launch will focus on the approximately 32,000 most severe patients in the U.S. and Europe. These patients have been sick their entire lives with a chronic often disabling disease that carries a high burden of care.\nThey could soon have the opportunity for a potential lifetime cure. Our launch preparations are informed by extensive market research and insight generation, including through direct engagement with patients, providers and payers to understand their perceptions of gene therapy and the potential uptake of a product like exa-cel. We are encouraged by the strong interest and enthusiasm shown by all stakeholders for a genetic therapy that could provide transformative benefit for patients.\nStarting with patients. The journey for someone to receive XL can be summarized in 3 key phases. One, the pretreatment period where patients decide a genetic therapy is right for them and are referred to an authorized treatment center by their hematologists and begin the cell collection process. two, the manufacturing period where a patient cells are edited and become the XL drug product; and three, the treatment period, where a patient receives myeloablative conditioning, then they're edited cells and is followed for successful engraftment.\nSurvey data from sickle cell and beta-thalassemia patients indicate that more than 1/4 strongly believe genetic therapy is the right choice for them. Of the balance, the vast majority want to learn more about future treatment options through their own research and through the live experiences of exa-cel patients and their treating physicians. With providers, we've learned there is a clear recognition of the differences between various genetic therapy approaches and a strong preference for gene-edited therapies like exa-cel, over gene insertion approaches using lentivirus. Our market research suggests that approximately 70% of providers prefer a gene-editing approach over other gene therapy mechanisms Our teams are focused on providing access to key support and systems for both patients and providers to ensure the best possible treatment experience. Accordingly, we have made strong progress toward ensuring authorized treatment centers are administratively and logistically prepared to initiate the exa-cel treatment journey for patients upon approval. Approximately 50 U.S. centers are actively engaged in the process to become an ATC located in those areas with the highest prevalence of patients. Similarly, in all 4 key European markets, all 25 targeted ATC sites are in process. Payers are another important area of focus. We are actively engaging with key commercial and government payers and policymakers in the U.S. and Europe.\nFirst, with regard to commercial payers in the U.S., our conversations are focused on the patient need and clinical profile of exa-cel including dramatic reductions in VOCs and hospitalizations for sickle cell disease patients and in transfusions for beta-thalassemia patients.\nWe are confident that payers will recognize exa-cel value in patient populations where current lifetime cost of care can exceed $4 million. We are working with insurers to ensure broad access for the approximately 35% of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients who are commercially insured.\nNow to government payers.\nApproximately 45% of severe sickle cell disease patients in the U.S. are ensured by Medicaid. And thus, we've also been working with state agencies to ensure Medicaid patients have broad access to exa-cel. We recognize that a critical element for adoption is ensuring a separate payment for the XL therapy in addition to the reimbursement already in place for the transplant procedure costs. Encouragingly, many states are already providing access to cell and gene therapies with separate payment policies for the procedure and the therapy, and we continue to engage with state agencies around payment models ahead of the launch.\nIn addition, in February of this year, the Biden administration demonstrated their commitment to ensuring access to cell and gene therapies like exa-cel through the announcement of a CMS demonstration project called the Cell and Gene Therapy or CGT access model. The CGT access model will be administered through CMS' innovation center, which is a total budget of approximately $10 billion for the exploration and testing of novel delivery methods and approaches. Intended to accelerate and enhance broad Medicaid access for sickle cell disease patients, the CGT access model will, over time, facilitate this in 2 important ways. By creating a pathway for state Medicaid agencies to delegate authority to CMS to coordinate and facilitate innovative payment models, including Outcomes-based Agreements or OBAs with cell and gene therapy manufacturers like Vertex. And in addition, CMS has confirmed any outcomes-based arrangement for inpatient therapies requires payment separate from the hospital inpatient bundle.\nWe view this CGT access model as an important indicator of the understanding of the severity of these diseases and the need to provide broad access to potentially transformative therapies for these historically underserved patient populations. We are extremely excited about the potential for exa-cell our first commercial launch outside of CF in many years and look forward to updating you further on our launch preparation activities on future calls.\nI'm also looking forward to updating you on our continued progress to discover, develop and secure access to transformative medicines for all people living with CF. I will now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration, Bruker Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's results in the first quarter of 2023 demonstrate our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile regardless of macroeconomic conditions. First quarter 2023 revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $2.37 billion. Growth was led by a 33% year-over-year increase outside the U.S. on continued strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions into younger age groups. U.S. CF revenue grew 3% year-over-year with ongoing consistent performance. .\nFirst quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.2 billion compared to $687 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nQ1 2023 results include $347 million of acquired IP R&D charges compared to just $2 million of such charges in the first quarter of 2022.\nFirst quarter 2023 IP R&D expenses resulted from several new collaborations, which augment our internal innovation efforts as detailed on Slide 15, including collaborations with Entrada Therapeutics and DM1 and immunogen for gentler conditioning agents and the expansion of our relationship with CRISPR Therapeutics into type I diabetes. Aside from our investments in external innovation and the resulting higher acquired IPR&D charges operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research and our advancing pipeline, which includes mid- and late-stage clinical assets across 8 different disease areas.\nFor example, these investments are directed towards clinical studies for the vanzacaftor triple in CF, VX-548 in acute pain and type I diabetes as well as pre-commercial build-out activities for exa-cel and other potential near-term launches. Given the potentially transformative benefit to patients and multibillion-dollar market opportunities for our programs, we will continue to invest appropriately.\nFirst quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $902 million in the quarter compared to $1.17 billion in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $3.05. We ended the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash and investments as our cash flow generation and balance sheet remain very strong.\nNow switching to guidance. Given our first quarter results and our consistent execution, there are no changes to our 2023 financial guidance as detailed on Slide 16. We continue to expect product revenue guidance of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth year-over-year. Note that this guidance continues to include an expected approximate 1.5 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.\nAs we mentioned in early February, given our years of experience in CF, we have strong visibility to our 2023 revenue guidance range, which is inclusive of expected new approvals like the TRIKAFTA U.S. approval in patients ages 2 to 5 and and new reimbursements outside the U.S.\nNote too that 2023 product revenue guidance continues to reflect revenue from cystic fibrosis products only. Exa-cel is not included in guidance as potential approval and launch dates in the EU, U.K. and U.S. are still to be determined. We are also reiterating our 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion.\nOur 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance now includes approximately $400 million of upfronts in milestones from previously existing or recently completed BD transactions versus the $300 million that was anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nOur operating expenses continue to be more than 70% allocated to R&D and are funding the significant continued progress of our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs. Additionally, we are funding the expansion of our commercialization capabilities in anticipation of the multibillion-dollar market opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential.\nOur guidance for projected full year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22% is also unchanged. In closing, Vertex performed exceptionally well in the first quarter of 2023. We delivered strong revenue growth, invested internally and externally and accelerated programs across our diverse pipeline. We're also proud of our industry-leading culture of innovation that we believe will continue to drive long-term success. A few highlights from our recently published corporate responsibility report are found on Slide 17.\nAnd as we continue to advance our programs in 2023, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on Slide 18 and to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSVP of IR, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nGood evening, everyone. My name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Vertex, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results conference call.\nOn tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex' CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex' marketed cystic fibrosis medicines, our pipeline, and Vertex' future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.\nI would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, the impact of the foreign exchange is presented inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. I'll now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Susie. Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have closed out a strong 2022 with full year global CF product revenue up 18% versus 2021. Our full year 2023 product revenue guidance is $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth year-on-year, inclusive of FX headwind of approximately 1.5%.\nWe have more than 20,000 patients still to reach with CFTR modulators, and we continue to work with focus and urgency to reach all patients with CF around the globe who may benefit from our therapies. It is an exciting time for Vertex. Our medicines have transformed CF, and the growth of our CF business has transformed Vertex.\nOur differentiated R&D approach led to our multiple life-changing therapies in cystic fibrosis and is designed to deliver transformative medicines for serious diseases at high rates of success, agnostic to modality. It is delivering just that.\nIn aggregate, our mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline holds the promise to deliver potentially transformative benefit for patients across 8 disease areas as detailed on Slide 5. Each program holds the potential to be best-in-class and transform the disease, and each represents a multibillion-dollar market opportunity.\nFurthermore, we see the opportunity to launch new products into 5 of these disease areas within the next 5 years or our 5-in-5 goal. And we're not done. The next wave of innovation is also making progress and advancing through preclinical development, including programs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy Type 1.\nThis breadth of pipeline success accelerated pace of clinical trial progress and build-out of commercial capabilities for upcoming product launches warrant continued investments in 2023. As such, we are strategically investing and focusing on execution to drive forward this significant opportunity. With a uniquely strong and durable CF franchise, a deep, broad and advancing R&D pipeline with multiple potentially near-term commercial opportunities, a strong balance sheet and a deeply talented and committed team, Vertex is well-positioned to deliver for patients and shareholders for years to come.\nWith that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&D progress, starting with CF. We'll continue our journey in cystic fibrosis as we serially innovate to bring highly efficacious therapies to all CF patients. Our next-in-class vanzacaftor triple combination completed enrollment in its 2 Phase III clinical trials, SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 and in patients ages 12 years and older in Q4 of 2022.\nWhile TRIKAFTA sets a very high bar, our enthusiasm for this vanzacaftor program is also high. This program could deliver even greater benefits to patients, given, one, our highly predictive in vitro human bronchial epithelial or HBE cell assays, a showed the vanza triple was superior to TRIKAFTA in improving chloride transport, a direct measure of CFTR function.\nTwo, our Phase II clinical data also suggests the potential for greater efficacy for vanzacaftor versus TRIKAFTA. And three, the vanzacaftor triple also has the benefit of once-daily oral dosing and a substantially reduced royalty burden relative to TRIKAFTA. The Phase III trials are currently in the 52-week dosing period, and we anticipate their completion towards the end of this year.\nAnother important program is the VX-522 program, our CFTR mRNA approach that we are developing in partnership with Moderna for CF patients who cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators. In December of 2022, and the FDA cleared the IND for VX-522, and the single ascending dose study in CF patients was initiated last year, a major milestone for Vertex and the field.\nWe have high expectations given over 5 years of research that led to the discovery of VX-522 with the following properties: one, delivery of mRNA at high efficiency into HBE cells; two, expression of CFTR protein leading to high levels of chloride transport; and three, in both rodents and nonhuman primates, expression of CFTR protein in the desired cells; and lastly, a preclinical safety profile that supported advancement into human clinical trials. We are excited with the progress of VX-522, which brings hope to the more than 5,000 CF patients who are still waiting for a treatment that targets the underlying cause of their disease.\nTurning now to exa-cel, our gene editing program for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. This is our most advanced program outside of CF, and we expect exa-cel to be our next commercial launch.\nIn late Q4, we completed our regulatory submissions for exa-cel for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia in the EU and U.K. Both the EMA and the MHRA have recently validated the MAA submissions. And in the U.S., we remain on track to complete our rolling BLA submission by the end of this quarter. The remarkable clinical benefits are evident in the data we've shared to date. exa-cel holds the promise to be the first CRISPR-based gene editing treatment to be approved and represents a near-term and significant market opportunity, which Stuart will detail.\nTurning next to VX-548 and our pain program. VX-548 is our novel selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds a promise of highly effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive potential of opioids. If approved, VX-548 would represent the first new class of pain medicine in decades with the potential to address the staggeringly high unmet need in acute pain.\nVX-548 acts on the peripheral nerves to block the pain signal, and thus may be able to provide effective pain relief without the abuse potential, which is a central nervous system phenomenon. We have high expectations for this program because NaV1.8 is a genetically and pharmacologically validated target.\nSecond, we have multiple positive proof-of-concept results with VX-150, a predecessor molecule to VX-548, and proof-of-concept with VX-548 itself. And lastly, our Phase III program in acute pain is substantially similar to the positive Phase II trials we have already conducted.\nVX-548 has been granted Fast Track and breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. We initiated pivotal development last year, and we are enrolling patients across 3 Phase III studies with the goal of seeking a broad, moderate-to-severe acute pain label. We anticipate completing the Phase III pivotal program towards the end of this year or the beginning of next, creating another potentially significant and near-term commercial opportunity, which Stuart will also discuss.\nIn addition to validation of NaV1.8 as a target in acute pain, it has also been validated as a target in neuropathic pain. I am pleased to share that in late Q4, we initiated a 12-week Phase II dose-ranging proof-of-concept study for VX-548 in peripheral neuropathic pain. We look forward to updating you as this Phase II program progresses and to sharing more on the market opportunity on future calls.\nTransitioning now to inaxaplin, or VX-147, the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD. Post the positive Phase II proof-of-concept study inaxaplin is now being studied in a single adaptive Phase II/III pivotal trial.\nThis study has a preplanned interim analysis at 48 weeks of treatment, which, if positive, could serve as the basis to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. Our goal is to complete the Phase II dose-ranging portion of the Phase II/III pivotal study this year, selected dose and then continue on to the Phase III portion.\nWe are also working to increase awareness, screening and diagnosis through multiple initiatives, given the high unmet need and the approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe alone. With inaxaplin, we see the potential of bringing a first-in-class treatment to patients with AMKD and unlocking a multibillion-dollar market opportunity.\nMoving to Type 1 diabetes, where our goal is to deliver a transformative, if not curative therapy for the more than 2.5 million patients with Type 1 diabetes in North America and Europe. We are advancing multiple programs. First, VX-880s are stem cell-derived fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells, which use standard immunosuppressives to protect the cells from the immune system.\nThese cells are also foundational for the other 2 T1D programs. For VX-880, we achieved proof-of-concept last year with the first 2 patients treated in Part A of the VX-880 study. We have now fully enrolled Part B where patients will receive the target dose on a staggered basis.\nThe next phase is Part C, expected to initiate later this year in which patients will be treated concurrently with the target dose. We look forward to sharing VX-880 data from more patients and with longer duration of follow-up at medical congresses this year.\nSecond, VX-264 or the cells plus device program, which encapsulates these same fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells in a proprietary device that shields the cells from the body's immune system, and hence, there is no requirement for immunosuppressants.\nIn late Q4, we simultaneously filed a CTA in Canada as well as the IND in the U.S. As we shared last month, the CTA has cleared, and we look forward to initiating enrollment and dosing of patients in Canada in the coming months. In the U.S., the IND has not cleared. We've received and responded to the FDA's questions. We look forward to working with the agency with urgency so that we can initiate the study in the U.S. as soon as possible.\nThird, in our hypoimmune program, we are editing the same fully differentiated insulin-producing islets to cloak them from the immune system, another path to obviating the need for immunosuppressives. This program continues to progress in preclinical development.\nLet me close the T1D section with an update on the ViaCyte acquisition through which we gained intellectual property, tools and capabilities that hold the potential to accelerate our goal of developing transformative treatments for this disease. We have now completed our data and portfolio review and are very pleased with the progress to date. We have begun executing our integration plans.\nOn the clinical side, a Phase I/II study of VCTX-211, a hypoimmune cell program that originated with ViaCyte and that Vertex is now developing in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics, has been initiated and is ongoing. All other ViaCyte clinical trials have completed enrollment and dosing and are in the follow-up stage.\nI'll finish up with the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD program. Both a Phase I study of VX-634, the first in a series of next-wave AAT correctors and a 48-week Phase II study of VX-864, our first-generation AAT corrector, are ongoing. We look forward to updating you as these programs advance.\nI'll now ask Stuart to review our commercial progress.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Reshma. Today, I will review our continued strong performance and outlook in CF as well as potential near-term commercial launches in new disease areas with exa-cel and VX-548.\nStarting with CF, where we continue to bring our transformative medicines to many more patients globally. Last month, we raised our estimate for the number of patients with cystic fibrosis in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Canada to 88,000, up from our previous estimate of 83,000.\nThe growth in the CF population can be attributed to more patients coming forward to receive treatment, better data capture in patient registries, and perhaps most importantly, people with CF are living longer due to improvements in patient care and the availability of truly effective therapies. For a baby born with CF in 2021, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation predicts the median age of survival is now 65 years.\nIn the U.S., our focus remains on maintaining the very high persistence and compliance rates we have seen with our therapies and extending the benefits into younger age groups. Outside the U.S., uptake of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in countries with recent reimbursement agreements continues to drive growth, as has the rollout of KAFTRIO in children ages 6 to 11 years in countries where this indication has recently received reimbursed access such as France and Spain.\nThere are still more than 20,000 CF patients who could benefit from but are not on CFTR modulator treatment. These patients fall primarily into 2 categories: one, patients in countries where we are early on the launch curve; and two, younger patients, for whom we continue to pursue additional label and reimbursement extensions such as the recent U.S. approval of ORKAMBI for ages 1 to 2 years, and recent regulatory submissions for KALYDECO in children ages 1 to 4 months and for TRIKAFTA in ages 2 to 5 years, which has received priority review and a PDUFA date of April 28 in the U.S. We are confident that we will reach the vast majority of these patients over time, which will continue to drive revenue growth in the near and long term.\nWe also see exciting growth potential for our vanzacaftor triple combo given the anticipated clinical profile more convenient once-daily dosing and the potential to offer a new option for patients who have discontinued prior CFTR modulator therapy.\nFinally, in CF, as Reshma mentioned, our CFTR mRNA program, VX-522 is being developed for the more than 5,000 CF patients worldwide who currently do not have any therapies that treat the underlying cause of their disease. I will now detail our commercial readiness efforts and the market opportunity for 2 potential product launches outside of CF, exa-cel and VX-548.\nExa-cel holds curative potential for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, and we are making significant progress with launch preparation activities. Our initial launch of exa-cel will focus on the approximately 32,000 individuals in the U.S. and Europe for whom these diseases are most severe, presenting a significant clinical, humanistic and economic burden.\nThe estimated 25,000 severe sickle cell disease patients have multiple hospitalizations annually for vaso-occlusive crises, while the estimated 7,000 TDT patients undergo near-monthly transfusions. There is also a considerable financial burden, both for these patients and to the health care system.\nIn the U.S., economic models project the lifetime treatment costs for severe sickle cell disease patients to be between $4 million and $6 million. Recent market research indicates that physicians have a strong preference and interest in gene editing over other potentially curative approaches and that patients with sickle cell disease are increasingly optimistic about the potential role for curative therapies in the treatment of their disease.\nIn addition, payers view the emerging clinical data for exa-cel as highly impactful, most notably the reductions in vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. Importantly, for our specialty commercial model, these 32,000 severe patients are concentrated geographically, and we believe can be served effectively with a network of approximately 50 authorized treatment centers or ATCs in the U.S. and approximately 25 in Europe. We have established the needed supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure to support the launch, including validated chain of identity and chain of custody systems, global shipping infrastructure and the needed manufacturing capacity to support uptake following approval.\nAnd finally, we continue to work with key commercial and government payers and policymakers in the U.S. and Europe to ensure they understand the significant burden of these diseases and that broad patient access and reimbursement are in place if and when exa-cel is approved. To date, we have engaged with all U.S. state Medicaid agencies, some 150 unique U.S. commercial payers as well as multiple health technology assessment bodies in Europe, including NICE and GBA to share important information about exa-cel and our commitment to working collaboratively to provide access to this therapy.\nShifting now to VX-548, which we believe has the potential to play an important role across the pain spectrum, including acute pain and chronic pain conditions. I'll focus my comments on acute pain, which is a near-term commercial opportunity.\nThere are 4 aspects critical to framing the acute pain opportunity for Vertex. One, there is a significant unmet need due to the limitations and drawbacks of currently available treatments. Two, the market is large today, even with 90% generic prescribing. Three, prescribing is concentrated in the hospital setting and thus addressable with a specialty commercial infrastructure. And four, there is broad stakeholder recognition of the need for new therapies, which also helps provide a clear path to future patient access and reimbursement.\nFirstly, millions in the U.S. suffer from acute pain each year, yet it is often difficult to manage effectively given the limitations of existing therapies. The current standards of care are NSAIDs and acetaminophen at one end of the spectrum, which are non-addicting but offer limited pain relief and can pose GI and liver toxicity concerns.\nAnd at the other end of the spectrum are opioids, which provide effective pain relief but have many undesirable side effects, including nausea and somnolence and have significant abuse potential. Many large hospital systems and all 50 states have adopted restrictions for the use of opioids. This leaves a vast gap in the treatment landscape for a medicine like VX-548 and with strong efficacy, a desirable benefit-risk profile, and without abuse potential, given it is peripherally acting.\nSecond, the acute pain market is very large, valued in the U.S. at $4 billion despite 90% of prescriptions being generic. Third, this highly concentrated market can be served with a specialty commercial model. Of the 1.5 billion treatment days for acute pain annually, some 2/3 or 1 billion are driven by hospital prescribing, following inpatient or outpatient procedures such as surgeries or emergency room visits.\nFurthermore, these hospital-driven prescriptions are concentrated among approximately 1,700 hospitals that aggregate to roughly 220 integrated delivery networks. Thus, we believe we can reach a large proportion of this market with a specialty sales and marketing infrastructure and have begun to hire for key positions.\nFourth and finally, given the wide stakeholder recognition of the limitations of current treatments and the unmet need, we see both high demand and a clear path to access and reimbursement for a medicine with a profile like VX-548. A key example of the path to reimbursement and access is the recently passed NOPAIN or Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act signed into law last December.\nThrough the NOPAIN Act, Congress has directed CMS to make a separate add-on payment to hospitals in the outpatient and ambulatory surgery center setting for non-opioids for the treatment of pain. We believe this new law is an important sign of the growing movement to remove barriers for hospitals, providers and patients to utilize non-opioid treatment options.\nIn closing, we are excited about the opportunity to extend the benefits of our CF medicines to more patients around the globe and the near-term potential to commercialize transformative treatments for patients with sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia and acute pain.\nI will now turn the call to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex' fourth quarter full year 2022 results represent another year of strong execution and exceptional financial performance. Fourth Quarter 2022 revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. Growth was led by a 24% year-over-year increase outside the U.S. on continued strong TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions into younger age groups. U.S. CF revenue grew 5% year-over-year with ongoing consistent performance.\nFull year 2022 revenue of $8.93 billion represents 18% growth versus 2021, marking Vertex' eighth consecutive year of at least double growth. Full year 2022 International revenue of $3.23 billion increased 41% and full year U.S. revenue of $5.7 billion increased 8% compared to 2021. For the full year 2022, we estimate the changes in foreign exchange negatively impacted our global revenue growth rate by approximately 1.5 percentage points, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.\nFourth quarter 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $872 million, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $3.07 billion, a decrease of 11% versus the prior year.\nRecall that 2021 results were impacted by $1.1 billion of acquired IPR&D charges, including the onetime $900 million payment to CRISPR compared to $116 million of such charges in 2022. Acquired IPR&D aside throughout 2022, we continued to invest in research in our advancing pipeline, which includes mid-and late-stage clinical assets across 8 different disease areas.\nThe year-over-year increase in spending reflects stepped-up investments in programs where we made notable clinical progress, particularly in pain, the new vanza triple as well as Type 1 diabetes. We also continued to invest in the pre-commercial build-out activities for exa-cel and preparation for other potential near-term launches. Given these programs' potentially transformative benefit to patients and multibillion-dollar market opportunities, we will continue to invest accordingly.\nFourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating margin was 50%, and we generated non-GAAP operating income of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15% versus the prior year period. Full year 2022 non-GAAP operating margin was 54%, and full year non-GAAP operating income was $4.79 billion, up 48% versus 2021. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion in cash and investments as our cash flow generation and balance sheet remain very strong.\nOn the business development front, in Q4, we announced a global collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics focused on therapeutics for DM1. The HSR period expired last night and the transaction is expected to close within days. As a result, our Q1 2023 results are anticipated to include an approximate $224 million up-front payment recorded in our income statement and an approximate $26 million equity investment recorded on the balance sheet.\nNow switching to guidance. We are establishing 2023 product revenue guidance of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing 7% to 9% year-over-year growth at current exchange rates. Note that this guidance includes an expected approximate 1.5 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.\nAlso note that 2023 product revenue guidance reflects revenue from cystic fibrosis products only. Exa-cel is not included in guidance as potential approval and launch dates in the EU, U.K. and U.S. are still to be determined.\nFor our CF franchise in 2023, we see continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in all major markets, further uptake in markets with recent reimbursement agreements and expansion into younger patient populations. Of note, with 4 years of TRIKAFTA experience, the majority of international reimbursement agreements secured and recent revisions in epidemiology, we have strong visibility to our 2023 revenue guidance range and another year of attractive growth for our CF product portfolio.\nWe are also providing 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses in a range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion, which includes approximately $300 million of upfronts and milestones from known collaborations including the expected up-front payment in Q1 2023 for Entrada.\nThis targeted investment increase is consistent with the significant continued progress of our multiple mid-and late-stage clinical development programs and the expansion of our commercial and manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of the multibillion-dollar market opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential.\nOur guidance for projected full year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate is a range of 21% to 22%. Lastly, we announced today a new $3 billion multiyear share repurchase authorization.\nIn closing, Vertex performed exceptionally well in 2022. We grew revenue double digits for the eighth consecutive year, maintained our strong balance sheet, invested internally and externally and accelerated programs across our diverse pipeline. In 2023, we look forward to further important milestones as highlighted on this slide to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas.\nWe look forward to updating you on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSVP of IR, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nGood evening, all. My name is Susie Lisa, and I'm thrilled to have joined Vertex as the new Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 financial results conference call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed cystic fibrosis medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. I will now turn the call over to Reshma.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Susie. We're delighted to have you on Board. Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Vertex continues to execute exceptionally well and make significant progress towards our goals of: one, reaching all patients with cystic fibrosis resulting in strong sustainable growth; two, advancing our diverse mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline to develop transformative medicines in multiple disease areas; three, preparing for our next commercial launches; and four, progressing the next wave of innovation towards the clinic.\nIn the third quarter, global CF product revenues increased 18% year-on-year to $2.3 billion as more patients initiated treatment with our CFTR modulators. Based on the strong performance, we are raising full year 2022 product revenue guidance from $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion to $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion. Despite the growing numbers of CF patients on CFTR modulators, we still have many more patients to reach. And as you will hear from Stuart, we are working with focus and urgency to reach all patients around the globe who may benefit from our therapies.\nAs previously discussed, we are at an important inflection point for the company. Each of our clinical stage programs, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, acute pain, AMKD, type 1 diabetes and AATD is a first-in-class or best-in-class approach that holds the promise to transform the disease and each represents a multibillion dollar opportunity. With a uniquely strong and durable CF franchise, a broad and deep R&D pipeline with multiple potentially near-term commercial opportunities, a strong balance sheet and the capacity to invest in both internal and external innovation and deeply talented people, Vertex is well positioned to deliver for patients and shareholders for years to come.\nWith that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&D progress, starting with CF. TRIKAFTA sets a very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy in the registrational trials as well as in real world and long-term studies. That said, if it is possible to develop even more effective medicines for CF patients, we are determined to be the company that does so. Our next-in-class triple combination, VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561, holds that potential.\nThe triple now referred to as vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, deutivacaftor or the vanzacaftor triple is progressing rapidly through Phase III development with our studies in patients ages 12 and older, now projected to complete enrollment this year. As a reminder, this combination demonstrated greater activity in our human bronchial epithelial assay versus TRIKAFTA and greater clinical benefit in Phase II than we have seen with any of our prior medicines.\nAdditionally, it offers the convenience of once-daily dosing and royalties in the low single digits versus low double digits for TRIKAFTA. For the 5,000 patients who do not make any CFTR protein, we're working on an mRNA therapy with our partners at Moderna. We have completed IND-enabling studies, and we remain on track to submit an IND for this program this quarter with clinical trials starting thereafter, and we're not done. Our work continues to identify even better potential therapies that could bring more patients with CF to carrier levels of sweat chloride.\nTurning to exa-cel, previously known as CTX001, our gene editing program for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, or TDT. This is our most advanced program outside CF, and we expect exa-cel to be our next commercial launch. In June, we presented data from 75 patients with up to 37 months of follow-up from our pivotal trials of exa-cel. The data demonstrated exa-cel's potential to provide a onetime functional cure for these patients.\nLast month, we announced that in addition to having granted virtually all available U.S. regulatory designations, the FDA has now also granted exa-cel a rolling review. We plan to begin our BLA submissions for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia in the U.S. next month, and complete the submissions by the end of the first quarter of 2023. In Europe, we previously shared that we reached agreement on the filing package with the EMEA and MHRA in the EU and U.K., respectively. We remain on track to submit these MAAs by the end of this year. Our teams are intensely focused on preparing these multiple complex submissions with 3 separate regulatory agencies in order to bring exa-cel to patients as quickly as possible.\nGiven that priority, we will not be sharing new clinical data at ASH, but instead, look forward to sharing updated clinical data in the first half of 2023. Exa-cel holds the promise for a onetime curative therapy for thousands of patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. This therapy, potentially the first CRISPR-based gene editing treatment to be commercialized for patients with a genetic disease also represents a near-term and significant market opportunity.\nTurning to VX-548 and our pain program. VX-548 is a novel selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that offers the potential of highly effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive potential of opioids. NaV1.8 is both a genetically and pharmacologically validated target. Recall that VX-150, an earlier-generation NaV1.8 inhibitor, demonstrated positive proof of concept in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. VX-548 has been studied in 2 Phase II placebo-controlled acute pain studies and showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful pain relief compared to placebo and was generally well tolerated.\nThe study also included an opioid reference arm to support the evaluation of VX-548. With regard to the regulatory status, VX-548 has been granted fast track and breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. We reached agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase III program in support of a broad label in moderate to severe acute pain and recently initiated the pivotal studies.\nThe Phase III development plan for VX-548 in acute pain consists of 2 randomized controlled trials. The design of the RCTs in the pivotal program is very similar to our Phase II completed studies, same pain states, post bunionectomy and post abdominoplasty. Same treatment duration, 48 hours and the same primary endpoint, the sum of pain intensity difference, or SPID, over 48 hours of VX-548 compared to placebo.\nA third single-arm study rounds out the Phase III program. This study will enroll patients with multiple other types of moderate to severe acute pain with a treatment period of up to 14 days. Given our experience in executing these types of trials efficiently, the short treatment duration and the high unmet need for effective pain relief without the significant side effects or addictive potential of opioids, we view VX-548 as a near-term and significant market opportunity. We also plan to study VX-548 in neuropathic pain and remain on track to initiate a Phase II dose-ranging proof-of-concept study in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy towards the end of this year.\nMoving to inaxaplin or VX-147, the first potential medicine to treat the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, or AMKD. Inaxiplin has breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. and both prime and orphan drug designation in Europe. Inaxaplin is being studied in a single adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II/III pivotal trial and the primary endpoint is a reduction in the rate of decline of kidney function in patients treated with inaxaplin on top of standard of care compared to standard of care for approximately 2 years.\nImportantly, the trial is a preplanned interim analysis at 48 weeks of treatment, which if positive, could serve as the basis for accelerated approval in the U.S. This study is underway in enrolling patients. We now have more than 50 sites open for enrollment in the U.S. and internationally with a goal to open more than 150 sites in total. We look forward to updating you on the enrollment and study progress as the trial advances.\nNext, moving on to type 1 diabetes. We have been advancing 3 programs in our portfolio. First, VX-880, our stem cell-derived, fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, which is a mid-stage clinical development. In this program, we use standard immunosuppressive therapy to protect the cells from the immune system. These same cells are the foundation for our other 2 programs in type 1 diabetes. Next, the cells plus device program, which encapsulates these fully differentiated islet cells in a proprietary device that shields the cells from the body's immune system and does not require immunosuppressants.\nWe remain on track to file the IND for this program by the end of this year. Lastly, in our hypoimmune cells program, which is in preclinical development, we are editing the same fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells to cloak them from the immune system, obviating the need for immunosuppressants. Earlier this year, we achieved proof of concept for VX-880 in type 1 diabetes with the first 2 patients dosed at half dose in Part A of the study. Part B of the study, which uses the full target dose is underway and enrolling patients. The type 1 diabetes program holds enormous potential. There are more than 2.5 million patients in the U.S. and EU alone with type 1 diabetes who may benefit from a treatment with the potential to provide glucose control without the fear of hypoglycemia or the need for insulin. We look forward to sharing additional data from more patients and longer duration of follow-up at the appropriate time.\nA last word on our type 1 diabetes program. Having recently closed the acquisition of Viacyte, I want to extend a warm welcome to our Viacyte colleagues. Let me close with our Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD program. Earlier this month, we announced that the IND for VX-634, the first in a series of next wave AAT correctors has cleared, and VX-634 has entered first-in-human clinical trials. We also announced that a 48-week Phase II study of VX-864, our first-generation AAT corrector will soon initiate. This study will assess the impact of longer-term treatment on polymer clearance from the liver as well as on serum levels of functional AAT.\nWith those R&D highlights, I'll hand it over to Stuart for a review of our commercial progress.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Reshma. I am pleased to review tonight our continued strong performance in CF as well as the multiple near-term commercial opportunities we see across our business, including the strong outlook in CF, significant progress made to prepare for the commercial launch of exa-cel and our view of the promising role of VX-548 in helping treat pain.\nStarting with CF. In the U.S., our focus is to maintain the very high persistence and compliance we have seen with our therapies and to extend the benefits of therapy to younger age groups. Outside the U.S., we have seen rapid growth driven by the uptake of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in countries with recent reimbursement agreements. We've also seen strong uptake of KAFTRIO in children ages 6 to 11 in countries where this indication has reimbursed access. Today, our medicines are approved and reimbursed in more than 30 countries, benefiting tens of thousands of cystic fibrosis patients on 5 continents.\nHowever, there are still thousands of CF patients who are not yet on treatment. These patients fall primarily into the following categories: one, patients in countries where we are early on the launch curve, such as those with recently achieved reimbursement agreements or label extensions for younger patients; two, patients in younger age groups for whom we continue to pursue label and reimbursement extensions; and three, to a lesser extent, patients awaiting reimbursement for our medicines in a small number of countries.\nWe are confident that we will reach the vast majority of these patients over time, which will drive continued revenue growth in the near and long term. We continue to make excellent progress expanding the label for our CFTR modulators to younger age groups. In September, ORKAMBI was approved for children ages 12 months to less than 24 months in the U.S. We expect to file for U.S. FDA approval of KALYDECO in children ages 1 month to less than 4 months before the end of 2022.\nSimilarly, we will submit to the U.S. and other global regulatory authorities for approval of TRIKAFTA in children 2 to 5 years old by the end of the year. Finally, in CF, as Reshma mentioned, our CFTR mRNA program is progressing toward an IND submission this year. This program targets the underlying cause of disease in approximately 5,000 CF patients worldwide. Beyond CF, we have a broad, diverse and advanced R&D pipeline. I will focus my comments on our commercial readiness efforts and the market opportunity for our potential next product launches, exa-cel and VX-548.\nExa-cel holds curative potential for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, and we are making significant progress with launch preparation activities. Treatment with exa-cel is a process that takes months from start to finish, and we fully recognize both the significant opportunities and challenges in offering such a novel, potentially curative therapy for patients.\nWe are creating the infrastructure and support required for physicians and patients that we believe will lead to commercial success upon potential regulatory approvals. Our commercial and medical science liaison field teams are hired and trained in the U.S. These teams have been actively engaging with key treatment centers, policymakers and payers and similar efforts are ongoing in Europe. Our initial launch of exa-cel will focus on the estimated 32,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with severe forms of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.\nRoughly 25,000 of these 32,000 patients are severe sickle cell disease patients, the vast majority of whom reside in the U.S. These patients are highly concentrated in certain geographies. And thus, we believe they can be served effectively with a network of approximately 50 qualified authorized treatment centers in the U.S. and approximately 25 in Europe. By way of context, we reached the vast majority of CF patients in the U.S. by calling on approximately 250 CF treatment centers. These centers have the medical and technical expertise to support the potential future use of exa-cel. Our field teams are already engaging with these centers on the needed administrative and logistical capabilities as well as the treatment capacity to support the launch.\nWe've been encouraged by the early interest and engagement from the centers and their staff. In parallel to engaging with these treatment centers, we have been working closely with policymakers and with payers to ensure that these stakeholders understand the significant burden of these diseases. Payment models are an important consideration, given the value that a onetime potentially curative therapy like exa-cel can bring to patients and the healthcare system.\nWe are continuing to work with various stakeholders to ensure patients who may be eligible for exa-cel have access to this potentially curative therapy.\nTurning to pain. We believe that VX-548 has the potential to play an important role across the pain spectrum, including an acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. With the recent initiation of the VX-548 Phase III program and the short treatment period in these trials, acute pain is now an exciting potential near-term commercial opportunity. I'll focus my remarks around 3 key aspects, critical to framing the acute pain market for Vertex.\nOne, the opportunity is significant, given the market today for acute pain in the U.S. is $4 billion, even though 90% of prescriptions are generic; two, prescribing is concentrated in the hospital setting and thus addressable with a specialty commercial infrastructure that fits the Vertex model; and three, there is a significant gap in the market for safe and effective treatment options for physicians and patients. Firstly, despite 90% generic penetration, the U.S. market is approximately $4 billion and patients received some 1.5 billion treatment days annually for the oral treatment of acute pain, a highly effective and well-tolerated new class of medicine, therefore, has multibillion dollar potential.\nSecondly, roughly 2/3 or $1 billion of these treatment days are driven by hospital prescribing following inpatient or outpatient procedures such as surgeries or emergency room visits. This includes the prescriptions written and filled in hospital during the patient's stay and those written at discharge to provide the patient with a multi-day course of medicine for ongoing pain management.\nGiven the concentration of pain treatment that is driven by hospital prescribing, we believe we can reach a large proportion of this market with a specialty sales and marketing infrastructure. And a third key consideration of this marketplace is the significant side effects of opioid therapy. Overdose deaths from opioids have continued to rise in the U.S. and opioid prescribing for the treatment of acute pain has been a clear contributing factor to the opioid epidemic. In response, hospitals, physicians and state agencies throughout the U.S. have limited or attempted to reduce the use of opioids for the treatment of acute pain. Many states as well as large hospital systems, such as Kaiser Permanente and John Hopkins Medicine, have enacted strict measures to reduce opioid prescribing.\nIn addition, beyond the addictive potential, opioids have other negative side effects, including nausea, somnolence, constipation and can result in increased length of hospital stay until these problems resolve. These concerns and limitations with opioids create a significant gap in the market for the treatment of acute pain because of the lack of safe and effective treatment options for doctors and patients. Therefore, availability of a therapy like VX-548, a novel, highly effective, non-opioid treatment that does not have the addictive potential of opioids nor the significant side effect profile would be an extremely valuable new treatment option and could be used as the next step in a treatment strategy after prescription NSAIDs, relegating opioids to being used only as a last resort.\nI look forward to updating you further on our commercialization plans in pain, including our view of the opportunity in neuropathic pain over the coming months. In closing, I'm excited about the opportunity to extend the benefits of our CF medicines to more and more patients around the globe and with the near-term potential commercialize multiple transformative treatments for patients with serious diseases outside of CF.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Stuart. Vertex's third quarter and year-to-date 2022 results set us on pace for another year of exceptional financial performance and strong execution. Third quarter 2022 revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, led by 46% growth outside the U.S. on continued strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions into younger age groups. U.S. CF revenue was up 5% with ongoing consistent performance aided by penetration into younger age groups. During the third quarter, CF revenue growth also benefited from an approximately $75 million increase in channel inventory in certain markets. We do not expect these purchases to recur in the fourth quarter, and this quarterly phasing is reflected in our updated full year guidance.\nThird quarter 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $758 million, an increase of 29% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Throughout 2022, we have continued to invest in our R&D pipeline, which now includes 7 programs, 5 of which are in pivotal development. The year-over-year increase in Q3 reflects stepped-up investments in these programs, notably pain, the new vanzacaftor triple in mRNA and CF and type 1 diabetes as well as the continued pre-commercial build-out activities for exa-cel.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue to invest in research and our clinical stage pipeline as well as in commercial readiness activities for programs with near-term significant commercial potential, including exa-cel and VX-548 for pain. We also remain committed to augmenting our internal research efforts with external innovation aligned with our R&D strategy.\nThird quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating margin was 55%. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 11% versus the prior year period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2022 was 21%. We ended the quarter with $9.8 billion in cash and investments as our cash flow generation and balance sheet remain very strong. On the business development front, we closed the previously announced acquisition of ViaCyte for $320 million in cash and integration activities are underway.\nNow switching to guidance. We are increasing our 2022 CF product revenue guidance by $150 million at the midpoint to a new range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion. The increase reflects the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recent reimbursement agreements and continued performance in the U.S. At the midpoint, the increased guidance represents full year 2022 revenue growth of approximately 17% versus 2021 and will mark Vertex's 8th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. There is no change to our projected 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expense range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion. There is also no change to our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance range of 21% to 22%.\nFinally, a comment on movements in foreign exchange. The impact of the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and other currencies since the start of the year is partially mitigated by our foreign exchange risk management program. For the full year 2022, at current rates, we estimate that changes in foreign exchange, net of program effects will have a negative impact of approximately 1% on our revenue growth, and this is reflected in our updated revenue guidance range for the year.\nIn closing, Vertex is performing exceptionally well despite the challenging macroeconomic climate. For the remainder of 2022 and into 2023, we look forward to further important milestones to mark our continued progress as highlighted on this slide. As Reshma noted, over the past year, Vertex has seen a significant acceleration in our R&D pipeline and we are well on our way to diversifying the company and adding to our long-term growth profile.\nAs always, we look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. Let me turn the call back to Susie to begin the question-and-answer period.\n\nSusie Lisa\n\nSVP of IR, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Charlie. Chuck, will you begin the queue, please?",

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nGood evening. This is Charlie Wagner, Vertex' Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 financial results conference Call.\nOn tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and myself. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. Also, the call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance we will review on the call this evening are non-GAAP.\nI will now turn the call over to Dr. Reshma Kewalramani.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Charlie, and good evening all.\nVertex continues to make strong progress towards our goal of reaching all CF patients eligible for our medicines. Based on the continued uptake of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. as well as in the international region, our Q2 CF product revenues grew 22% year-on-year to $2.2 billion. And based on this uptake as well as the new reimbursements recently secured, we are updating revenue guidance from $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion, to $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion.\nWe're also making rapid progress in advancing our R&D portfolio with programs in 5 disease areas now entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development, and the next wave of innovation getting ready to enter the clinic. Our expanding leadership in CF, coupled with the broad, deep and advanced research and clinical stage pipeline brings Vertex to this new inflection point highlighted last quarter. This inflection point is rooted in our differentiated R&D strategy, which is designed to increase the odds of success in drug discovery and development.\nThis strategy is working. First in CF and more recently, we have seen it deliver potentially transformative, if not curative therapies in multiple disease areas, including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, acute pain and type 1 diabetes, programs that are all now past the proof-of-concept stage. Each of these programs individually represents a multibillion-dollar market opportunity. And taken together, they represent enormous potential for patients and for Vertex.\nIn addition, we continue to use our strong balance sheet to pursue external innovation that complements or accelerates our internal efforts. The Viacyte acquisition, for example, has the potential to accelerate development of our type 1 diabetes programs. The early stage assets from Catalyst and the Verve collaboration complement our internal efforts in sandbox diseases. With our strong revenue growth and rapidly advancing pipeline, we are continuing to invest in internal and external innovation, as you see us do today with the increase in OpEx guidance to $3 billion to $3.1 billion, and the multiple business development deals we've announced this quarter.\nLet me now turn to the pipeline and review some of our recent R&D progress. Starting with CF. For patients who can benefit from CFTR modulators, TRIKAFTA has set a very high bar. But if it is possible to develop more effective medicines, we are determined to be the ones who do so. Our next-in-class triple combination, VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561, is now in Phase III development enrolling patients 12 years and older, and we remain on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year or early next. With the progress in the SKYLINE 1 and SKYLINE 2 trials, we've also recently initiated pivotal development of VX-121/tez/VX-561 in patients 6 to 11 years old.\nLastly, for patients who do not make any CFTR protein and cannot benefit from a CFTR modulator, we're developing an mRNA therapy with our partners at Moderna. We are on track to file the IND for the mRNA program in the second half of this year.\nMoving to CTX001. Our most advanced pipeline program outside of CF is our exa-cel, or CTX001 gene editing program in severe sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. In June, we presented data for more patients treated with exa-cel and with longer follow-up at the Annual Meeting of the European Hematology Association. These data, which included 75 patients with up to 37 months of follow-up continue to demonstrate that exa-cel holds the potential to be a durable, onetime functional cure for these patients and the safety data continue to be consistent with myeloablative conditioning and autologous bone marrow transplant.\nIn terms of next steps, we have recently concluded our discussions on the filing package with EMA and MHRA and have reached agreement on the filing package. We remain on track to submit the MAAs in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the EU and the U.K. in Q4 of this year. We expect to wrap up our conversations with the FDA regarding the filing package, in particular, the number of patients and duration of follow-up, in the coming weeks, and we look forward to updating you after that.\nTurning now to inaxaplin, or VX-147 in APOL1-mediated kidney disease, or AMKD. Inaxaplin is a small molecule inhibitor of APOL1 that targets the underlying cause of AMKD. Based on the unprecedented Phase II proof-of-concept results, which showed a 47.6% reduction in proteinuria, inaxaplin received Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. and Priority Medicines, or PRIME designation in the EU. The pivotal trial is a single adaptive Phase II/III randomized, placebo-controlled trial, and the primary endpoint is the reduction in the rate of decline of kidney function in patients who have been treated for approximately 2 years. Importantly, the study is designed to have a preplanned interim analysis at 48 weeks of treatment. If the interim analysis is positive, it will serve as the basis for us to seek accelerated approval in the U.S.\nWe initiated the inaxaplin pivotal trial in late March, site activation, patient screening and enrollment are all ongoing.\nMoving to pain. And VX-548, a novel first-in-class NaV1.8 inhibitor. We have high expectations from this program because NaV1.8 is both a genetically and pharmacologically validated target across acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. And VX-548 demonstrated a very desirable benefit/risk ratio profile in Phase II. Additionally, the VX-548 program represents a near-term commercial opportunity.\nTo recap, earlier this year, we shared positive proof-of-concept results from VX-548, which demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful relief of pain in 2 Phase II studies of acute pain, one in the post-bunionectomy setting and one in the post-abdominoplasty setting. Based on these results, the VX-548 has received Breakthrough Therapy designation, highlighting the significant need for highly efficacious and well-tolerated non-opioid pain medicines.\nWe are very pleased to have completed our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA and reach agreement on the VX-548 pivotal program in acute pain. The Phase III program will include 2 randomized placebo-controlled trials that will evaluate VX-548 post-bunionectomy and abdominoplasty. The exact same postsurgical acute pain settings we explored in Phase II.\nThese trials are shortened duration, approximately 2 days of treatment followed by 14 days of safety follow-up. Both of these Phase III studies will also include an opioid treatment arm. A third single-arm study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of dosing with VX-548 for up to 14 days across multiple other types of moderate to severe acute pain. We remain on track to initiate the pivotal development program by the end of this year. In addition, we have completed our preclinical studies to support initiating a Phase II dose-ranging proof-of-concept study of VX-548 in neuropathic pain towards the end of this year.\nTurning now to type 1 diabetes. In June, our VX-880 clinical data were featured in an oral presentation at the ADA Scientific Sessions. We've previously shared that we achieved proof-of-concept with the results from the first 2 patients who were treated in Part A with half the targeted dose. Both achieved glucose-responsive insulin secretion, improvements in hemoglobin A1C with concurrent reductions in or, as in the case of the first patient, elimination of exogenous insulin.\nThe new data that we presented at ADA included glucose time and range measurements. Time and range is important because it gives much more granular and comprehensive data than hemoglobin A1C alone and is correlated with the risk of developing micro and macrovascular complications. Patient 1 achieved a glucose timing range of 99.9% at day 270 versus 40.1% at baseline and remained insulin-independent. Patient 2 showed a glucose timing range of 51.9% at day 150 versus 35.9% at baseline with a 30% reduction in exogenous insulin. The trial, which has remained open in Canada and resumed enrollment in the United States last month, continues to screen and enroll patients in Part B.\nTo close, a word on the next wave of innovative therapies. These are programs in late preclinical development that are rapidly approaching the clinic. For the CFTR mRNA program, our cells and device program in type 1 diabetes and our next-generation AATD molecules, we expect to file INDs this year. Lastly, our gene editing program in DMD is in IND-enabling studies, and we plan to file the IND for this asset in 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Stuart for a commercial overview.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Reshma. I'm pleased to review tonight our continued strong performance in CF, the path towards future growth and the commercial opportunity and plans for some of the most advanced disease areas in our pipeline.\nI'll start with CF. Our CF business continued its rapid pace of growth this quarter, with impressive performance in both the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we continue to add new TRIKAFTA patients, with most of them being younger patients in the 6 to 11 age group, and persistence and compliance remain very high across all patient groups. Outside the U.S., we have seen rapid uptake of KAFTRIO across multiple European countries where we recently reached reimbursement agreements, notably France, Spain and Italy. We've now turned our focus in Europe to the launch of KAFTRIO in children ages 6 to 11. Additionally, the launches of TRIKAFTA in Canada and Australia are both off to a strong start.\nWe began the year with more than 25,000 patients in North America, Europe and Australia who could benefit from a CFTR modulator but were not yet on therapy. These patients fell primarily into 1 of 3 categories. One, patients who had not yet initiated therapy, largely in countries where we are recently reimbursed and therefore, early in the launch curve. Two, patients in geographies where we are not yet reimbursed and three, younger age groups who will be addressed through ongoing label expansions.\nWe are confident in our ability to reach the vast majority of these patients over time. We have made good headway securing new reimbursements and launching our medicines in the first half of 2022.\nAdditionally, we continue to make important progress in expanding access to younger patients. For instance, we completed the study of TRIKAFTA in patients 2 to 5 years old with positive efficacy results on the endpoints of lung clearance index and sweat chloride and no new safety signals. We expect to present these data at a medical meeting later this year and are on track to submit global regulatory filings by the end of the year. Additionally, we submitted regulatory filings in the U.S. and Europe for ORKAMBI in patients 12 months to less than 24 months of age. The PDUFA date for this filing is September 4.\nWe were pleased to present compelling long-term and real-world data on TRIKAFTA at the European Cystic Fibrosis Society's conference in June. These data underscore the outcomes with TRIKAFTA, specifically improved lung function, a 77% reduced risk of pulmonary exacerbations, an 87% lower risk of lung transplant and a 74% lower risk of death for patients with CF.\nFinally, in CF, as Reshma mentioned, we are developing a CFTR mRNA therapy to treat patients who do not make any CFTR protein and thus cannot benefit from a CFTR modulator. We estimate there are approximately 5,000 of these patients in North America, Europe and Australia. Outside of CF, we have made impressive strides with our clinical stage pipeline over the past 12 months. Today, I'd like to highlight the market potential for 3 of our late-stage clinical programs, exa-cel, inaxaplin and VX-548, and some of our pre-commercial activities. Each of these programs serves a very high unmet need and is a first-in-class or best-in-class approach, and each represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nBeginning with our most advanced pipeline program, exa-cel.\nOn our last few quarterly calls, we provided details on our launch preparation activities. So I'll briefly recap how we are thinking about the market size and our approach. There are approximately 32,000 patients who have severe sickle cell disease, or transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in the U.S. and EU. Our initial launch will focus on these 32,000 patients with severe disease, of whom 25,000 are patients with severe sickle cell disease with the vast majority of them living in the U.S. A small number of centers of excellence in the U.S. and Europe will treat the vast majority of these patients. Our research suggests that about 90% of U.S. patients reside in 24 states, and more than 75% of patients in Europe reside in 4 countries. We have identified the potential treatment centers and their referral networks in all of these countries.\nWe are confident that we'll be ready to launch exa-cel following approval. We have hired the launch teams, including medical science liaisons, medical affairs and access and reimbursement teams, and they are already active in the field. And finally, we are developing robust patient service programs to support patients throughout the treatment journey.\nMoving on to inaxaplin, or VX-147, which is in pivotal development for patients with AMKD. We've previously talked about a number of AMKD patients, which we estimate to be approximately 100,000 in the U.S. and Europe, with over 80% of them living in the U.S.\nHere, I'll touch on the work we are undertaking to raise awareness of AMKD. Awareness, diagnosis and genotyping of patients with AMKD are all low within the medical and patient communities, which is not surprising, given this is a newly defined disease without existing targeted therapies. To increase awareness of AMKD and of genetic testing options, we are working with the kidney disease community and with minority health organizations to support sponsored education campaigns and scientific workshops and seminars.\nSome examples of this work include: Sponsoring the American Kidney Funds APOL1 education campaign, which will launch this year to provide educational materials and digital engagement tools for patients and providers. And we are also educating people about AMKD at Black Health Matters Health Fairs and Summits, and through NephCure's Health Equity Initiative.\nIn addition to these disease awareness and education efforts, we and others are also working on important policy initiatives to support AMKD diagnosis. Specifically, we are advocating for federal legislation introduced in the spring entitled the New Era of Preventing End-Stage Kidney Disease Act that would establish a rare kidney disease research center at NIH, investigate the role of genetic screening in improving kidney disease outcomes and address kidney health disparities in communities of color. And we're also advocating alongside the National Kidney Foundation as well as other stakeholders to increase kidney disease screening. You may have seen in the news recently that the U.S. preventive services task force has added chronic kidney disease screening to the list of services they have under active consideration. If recommended, patients would have access to screening at no cost, which would make a huge difference in improving availability and access to screening for AMKD patients. Additionally, we are exploring pathways with diagnostic testing companies to make genetic testing more accessible to patients.\nFinally, VX-548 in pain. Given we recently announced agreement with FDA on the pivotal development program for acute pain, I'd like to give you a summary of the market opportunity. There is a real need for effective, safe and well-tolerated pain medicines as there have been no novel pain medicines introduced in the past 20 years. We see utility for our NaV1.8 inhibitors in different types of pain, including acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal.\nToday, I'm going to focus on acute pain.\nIn the U.S., there are approximately 1.5 billion treatment days for acute pain each year, and approximately 2/3 or 1 billion of those are driven by hospital prescribing. This includes treatment for inpatient and outpatient visits and the patient's related pain management following discharge. Consistent with our business strategy, a small specialty commercial organization will allow us to reach a large proportion of this market, given the concentration of pain treatment driven by hospital prescribing.\nToday, oral treatment of acute pain is roughly a $4 billion market, even though over 90% of prescriptions are generic. Considering the price of a typical branded pain medicine is roughly $10 per day, a safe and effective new pain medication without addictive potential that captures even a partial share of that market represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Importantly, given the magnitude and severity of the ongoing opioid crisis in the U.S., the initiation of the Phase III studies for VX-548 later this year, and the relatively short duration of the trials, we will be working with urgency to build out our teams and go-to-market plans to bring this novel nonopioid pain medicine to patients.\nIn closing, I'm excited about bringing TRIKAFTA to even more patients around the globe, and also commercializing multiple potentially transformative therapies outside of CF in the future.\nNow, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Stuart.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Vertex continued to deliver strong financial performance. Second quarter product revenues were $2.2 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our growth was again driven by an increased number of patients on therapy compared to the prior year, resulting from several approvals and reimbursements for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO over the last year as well as continued strong execution with market launches.\nMovements in foreign exchange had only a small impact on reported growth, primarily because of our active hedging program, which helps offset impact from currency movements.\nOur second quarter combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D and acquired IPR&D expenses were $750 million compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to the $900 million payment in the second quarter of 2021 for the amended collaboration agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics. This effect was partially offset by higher expenses resulting from our advancing pipeline, especially in CF, pain and type 1 diabetes as well as expenses for CF launches and pre-commercial activities for exa-cel.\nOur continued strong revenue growth, combined with our efficient operating model resulted in a Q2 non-GAAP operating margin of 54% and non-GAAP operating income of $1.19 billion compared to $71 million in the second quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by strong product revenue growth and the year-over-year comparison to the second quarter of 2021, which included the $900 million payment to CRISPR. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was 22%. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments, and our balance sheet profile remains very strong.\nAs Reshma highlighted, on the external innovation front, we've recently announced multiple business development deals including the acquisition of Viacyte for $320 million in cash with closing subject to certain conditions, including the expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. This transaction will bring us tools, technologies and assets that will accelerate our goal of bringing curative therapy to millions of people with type 1 diabetes.\nNow to guidance. We are raising our 2022 product revenue guidance to a range of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion based on current exchange rates. The increase reflects the rapid uptake we have seen with new launches in geographies where we recently secured reimbursement for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO as well as continued performance in the U.S. Year-over-year, our updated guidance represents product revenue growth of approximately 15% at the midpoint.\nNow to OpEx. Our R&D strategy was designed to deliver disproportionate success and we are seeing that strategy play out with multiple programs now in mid- and late-stage development, each of which could drive significant future growth. With our strong financial profile, we expect to continue investing in both internal innovation with our rapidly advancing pipeline as well as external innovation that fits with our R&D strategy and complements our existing portfolio. As a result, non-GAAP operating expenses for the year are now projected to be in a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of $2.82 billion to $2.92 billion. The increase is primarily due to incremental expenses resulting from the advancement of our pipeline programs into late-stage clinical trials, particularly in pain and AMKD as well as additional upfront and milestone payments.\nFinally, we continue to project a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. As we consider the second half of 2022 and into early 2023, we look forward to a number of important milestones to mark our continued progress, several of which are outlined on this slide.\nAs Reshma discussed earlier in the call, Vertex is at a new inflection point. We're in our eighth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, and we've built a remarkably durable business with long-term leadership in CF delivering strong cash flow for years to come. We're also well on our way to diversifying the business and adding to our long-term growth potential with 5 disease areas now in late-stage development and multiple new medicines set to enter the clinic. We are developing these programs with the intent of creating transformative, high-value medicines, each of which represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nFueled by our success in CF, we can continue to invest in our advancing pipeline while also delivering exceptional profitability and cash flow. As always, we look forward to updating you on our further progress throughout the balance of the year.\nLet's now open the call to questions.",

This is Michael Partridge. Welcome to Vertex's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call.\nOn tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Bastiano Sanna, Chief of Vertex Cell and Genetic Therapies and Dr. David Altshuler, Chief Scientific Officer, will join for Q&A.\nWe recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance we will review on the call this evening are non-GAAP.\nI will now turn the call over to Dr. Reshma Kewalramani.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael.\nBefore we begin, as this will be Michael Partridge's last quarterly call with us, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Michael for his outstanding service and contributions to Vertex.\nFor 25 years, he has been the face of Vertex with analysts and investors and with his calm and steady approach, Michael has led our IR team through countless milestones and many evolutions of the company. More recently, through the launch of all 4 of our marketed cystic fibrosis medicines and the emergence of our broad, mid- and late-stage pipeline, Michael has been an integral part of the Vertex leadership team, helping share our story with the world. Michael has shown a true passion for Vertex and the patients we serve. We are grateful for his dedication, and I want to personally thank Michael for all that he's done for Vertex.\nOn to the quarterly review. Vertex is off to an excellent start across the board with strong performance in the CF business, rapid advancement of the pipeline and continued operational excellence. Q1 CF product revenues grew 22% year-on-year to $2.1 billion, reflecting continued growth in the number of CF patients treated globally. And despite continued significant investment in internal and external innovation, our non-GAAP operating margins remained industry leading at 56%.\nWe maintained a rapid pace of progress in research and across the clinical stage pipeline with a half a dozen programs now post the POC stage. And we finished the quarter with a strong balance sheet and $8.2 billion in cash and investments.\nCF has been the exemplar of our R&D strategy. The last 6 to 12 months have made it clear. Our R&D strategy is proving itself beyond CF with the discovery and development of small molecules and cell and genetic therapies across a number of disease areas. This serial innovation enables the potential to transform, if not cure, multiple diseases and in so doing help more patients and drive long-term growth for the company.\nFundamentally, the goal of our strategy grounded in causal human biology, validated targets and biomarkers that translate from bench to bedside and all the way through pivotal development is to increase the odds of success in drug discovery and development. With the data we've generated in CF, in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, and now in rapid succession with positive proof of concept in APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain and type 1 diabetes, our clinical stage pipeline has never been broader in terms of the number of disease areas, more diverse in terms of modalities or more advanced.\nThe company is now at a new inflection point with continued growth in CF, the advancement of our broad clinical pipeline with 6 programs in mid- and late-stage development, representing multibillion dollar opportunities and the potential from the next wave of therapies approaching the clinic. In this next group of programs that have initiated IND-enabling studies is our mRNA program in CF, the cells plus device program in type 1 diabetes, the next wave of small molecule correctors in AATV and our in vivo gene editing program in DMD. A number of these programs are on track for IND filings later this year with clinical trials beginning thereafter. Our R&D strategy combined with our business model positions us well for continued innovation and sustained growth as we work to bring additional transformative medicines to more patients around the globe.\nWith this as context, I'll now review the R&D highlights for the quarter.\nLooking to our future in CF, we continue to strengthen our leadership for the long term. Our real-world experience with TRIKAFTA continues to accumulate, and as Stuart will discuss, raises the bar for any regimens in development. That said, if it is possible to outperform TRIKAFTA, we're determined to be the one to do so. Our next-in-class triple combination of VX-121/tezacaftor/561 is rapidly progressing through pivotal development. More than 180 clinical trial sites are open and enrolling patients in our Skyline Phase III program. We expect to complete enrollment by late 2022 or early 2023.\nAs a reminder, VX-121/tezacaftor/561 has the potential for greater clinical benefit than TRIKAFTA and is a more convenient once-daily treatment that carries a lower royalty obligation for Vertex.\nFor the more than 5,000 patients who do not make any CFTR protein and cannot benefit, therefore, from a CFTR modulator, we are developing an mRNA therapy together with our partner, Moderna. IND-enabling studies for this program have been completed, and we remain on track to submit an IND in the second half of 2022 with clinical development starting thereafter.\nTurning to the pipeline beyond CF. Starting with CTX001, our gene editing approach designed to provide a potential functional cure for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We plan to submit for U.S. and EU regulatory approvals for CTX001 for beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease by the end of 2022, and we expect this to be our next commercial launch. Enrollment in both Phase III studies is complete, and we have now dosed more than 75 patients across both programs. We look forward to sharing more clinical data on CTX001, including longer-term follow-up and more patients at medical forums this year.\nMoving on to VX-147, our first-in-class small molecule inhibitor for people with APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD, which has made rapid progress into pivotal development. In December, we reported unprecedented Phase II proof-of-concept results. In patients with FSGS, a particular kind of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, treatment with VX-147 led to a 47.6% reduction in proteinuria compared to baseline. VX-147 was generally well-tolerated. There were no SAEs related to VX-147, and all AEs were mild to moderate in severity.\nIn late March, we initiated pivotal development of VX-147 following agreement with FDA and the design of the program, which included: one, a single adaptive Phase II/III study design in people with 2 APOL1 mutations, proteinuria and decreased renal function; two, evaluation of VX-147 in the broad AMKD population representing approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe with this disease; and three, the ability to conduct an interim analysis, which, if positive, could provide a pathway to accelerated approval in the U.S.\nTransitioning now to our pain program. In late March, we announced that VX-548, a novel first-in-class, non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful relief in 2 Phase II studies of acute pain, meeting our high expectations. In the 2 studies, one following abdominoplasty and one following bunionectomy, VX-548 at the highest dose tested showed a rapid, sustained and consistent decrease in pain intensity compared to placebo on the primary endpoint of SPID48, a time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference from time of first dose to 48 hours.\nIn assessing the SPID48 score, it's important to note, higher scores indicate greater pain relief. VX-548 was superior to placebo with a statistically significant mean SPID48 of 37.8 in abdominoplasty, and 36.8 in bunionectomy. In the reference arm of the study, standard of care opioid therapy showed a mean SPID48 difference from placebo of 12.5 and 14.7, respectively.\nFrom a safety and tolerability perspective, VX-548 was well-tolerated at all doses. There were no serious adverse events related to VX-548 and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate.\nGiven the high unmet need for an efficacious and well-tolerated, non-opioid pain medicine, we are working with urgency to advance VX-548. Our goal is to bring forward a novel class of pain treatment with the potential to provide effective pain relief without the addictive potential or adverse side effects of opioids. We plan to advance VX-548 into pivotal development for acute pain in the second half of 2022, pending discussions with regulators.\nI'll conclude with the type 1 diabetes program and VX-880, our stem cell-derived fully differentiated islet cell replacement therapy that could offer a functional cure for people living with type 1 diabetes. In the U.S. and Europe alone, type 1 diabetes affects more than 2.5 million people. As we announced earlier this week, the VX-880 program has been placed on clinical hold in the U.S. by the FDA and we're working with urgency to understand more. At that time, we also shared the safety and efficacy data from the first 3 patients treated to date.\nTo recap, the first patient was treated with half the target dose of cells, has achieved insulin independence at day 270, with a hemoglobin A1C level of 5.2%. The second patient also a half dose had positive results through day 150. The patient achieved robust increases in measures of pancreatic islet cell function and improved glucose control while simultaneously experiencing a 30% decrease in exogenous insulin use.\nTaken together, the results from patients 1 and patients 2, both treated at half dose, demonstrate proof of concept for VX-880.\nThe third patient who is the first to receive a full dose of VX-880 has reached the day 29 milestone. As of day 29, the patient showed encouraging early indications of efficacy, with increasing C-peptide levels and improving glycemic control. The first detailed assessment of pancreatic islet function and glycemic control for patients in the study occurs at the day 90 visit. Across the program, in the 3 patients dosed to date, there are no SAEs related to VX-880. The majority of adverse events are mild to moderate, and the overall safety profile is consistent with the immunosuppressive regimen used in the study and the perioperative period.\nThese are the data to date. Of course, all 3 patients will be continued to be followed per study protocol. We look forward to working constructively and expeditiously with the FDA to understand and address their questions so that we can resume the trial as soon as possible in the U.S.\nTo close out on type 1 diabetes, a quick word on our cells plus device program. We continue to make progress with our sales and device approach. In this program, instead of using immunosuppression to protect the cell from the immune system, the immunoprotective device is designed to serve that function. We remain on track for an IND filing for this program later this year.\nIn summary, Vertex continues to deliver significant growth in CF, we're making rapid progress with programs in 6 disease areas in mid- and late-stage development, including 5 programs that are already in or entering pivotal development, with another wave of programs on track to enter the clinic starting later this year. We have a strong financial profile and balance sheet that enables continued investment to drive serial innovation.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Stuart.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Reshma.\nI'm pleased to review tonight our continued strong commercial performance in CF, our clear path towards future growth in CF and our plans for expansion into additional disease areas.\nVertex's CF business continues to grow at a rapid pace, driven by consistent performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and the continued robust uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO outside the U.S., following significant reimbursement progress internationally over the past year. Q1 CF product revenue of $2.1 billion grew 22% year-over-year as more patients have come on therapy. U.S. revenues grew 9% to $1.37 billion in the first quarter of 2022 driven by additional patients starting treatment with TRIKAFTA, most notably children ages 6 to 11, following the mid-2021 approval. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 55% over the first quarter of 2021 to $729 million, driven by rapid uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in countries where we reached reimbursement agreements.\nWe started the year with more than 25,000 patients in North America, Europe and Australia, who could benefit from a CFTR modulator but were not yet on therapy. These patients fell primarily into 1 of 3 categories: one, patients who have not yet initiated treatment, largely in countries where we are recently reimbursed and therefore, are early in the launch curve; two, patients in geographies where we are not yet reimbursed; and three, younger age groups who will be addressed through ongoing label expansions. We are confident in our ability to reach the vast majority of these patients over time.\nTRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO are now available and reimbursed in more than 25 countries. We have continued to reach new reimbursement agreements with the most notable reached example being Australia, where TRIKAFTA is now reimbursed for eligible patients ages 12 and above. We also continue to make progress extending treatment to younger patients. In January, we secured approval for KAFTRIO in Europe and the U.K. for children ages 6 to 11. And in April, Health Canada granted marketing authorization for TRIKAFTA for the same patients. In the U.S., we recently submitted an sNDA for approval of ORKAMBI for children ages 1 to less than 2 years. We also completed enrollment in the Phase III study of TRIKAFTA in children ages 2 to 5 and anticipate submitting for U.S. approval for this age group before the end of 2022.\nAs Reshma mentioned, powerful real-world and long-term experience with TRIKAFTA further strengthens the clinical value proposition of this combination. We have previously shown evidence that treatment with our medicines, KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO slows lung function decline, one of the hallmarks of disease progression for CF patients. We now have data that compares lung function over time for patients treated with TRIKAFTA to untreated matched controls. And these data show that patients on TRIKAFTA on average, do not lose any lung function over a 2-year follow-up period. Generally, CF patients lose 1% to 3% of lung function every year. WE will be presenting these important new data at an upcoming medical forum.\nAs Reshma noted, the last 6 to 12 months have been a remarkable period for Vertex as multiple programs reached late-stage development. I would like to provide a few thoughts on 2 programs in late-stage development that could be among our next commercial opportunities.\nStarting with CTX001, our CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy for hemoglobinopathies, which we plan to file for regulatory approval before the end of this year. Commercial and launch preparation activities for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia are well underway. Over the past year, we have developed a deep understanding of the sickle cell and TDT markets, including where patients with these diseases are concentrated, the physicians who would refer them for treatment and the key treatment centers that will facilitate the patient journey. With our submissions planned for later this year, our launch preparation activities are progressing rapidly. Key leadership positions and teams are in place across multiple functions, including medical, commercial and manufacturing. A small number of centers of excellence in the U.S. and Europe will treat the vast majority of severe sickle cell and thalassemia patients.\nOur research suggests that about 90% of U.S. patients reside in 24 states and about 75% of patients in Europe reside in 4 countries. We have identified the potential centers and their referral networks in these countries. We are already engaging with public and commercial payers in the U.S. and EU, and we are developing robust patient service programs to support patients throughout the treatment journey. We continue to see tremendous potential for CTX001 to help patients, and we look forward to the possibility of bringing this groundbreaking therapy to those living with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.\nFinally, with the recent completion of the 2 Phase II studies in acute pain and the positive POC results in both studies, as Reshma noted, we now plan to advance VX-548 into pivotal development in acute pain in the second half of this year.\nLet me review with you briefly the market opportunity we see in pain. There is a vast unmet need in the treatment of moderate to severe pain and especially for medicines with an improved benefit risk profile, including avoiding the side effects and addictive qualities of standard of care opioids. To give you some perspective on the market for acute pain, which is our initial target market for VX-548, every year, there are more than 1.5 billion treatment days for acute pain in the U.S. with a large proportion of these including a prescribed opioid. It is an unfortunate fact that some of these scripts result in addiction problems for some patients and contribute to the opioid epidemic in the U.S. Provisional data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics for the latest 12-month period ending April 2021 recently estimated that there were more than 75,000 overdose deaths from opioids in the U.S., an increase of 35% compared to the prior 12-month period.\nA novel, highly effective class of medicines that does not have these safety concerns would therefore have tremendous potential. For instance, one can imagine a step therapy paradigm in which a patient is started on NSAIDs, escalated to a NaV1.8 inhibitor, and only as a last resort, prescribed an opioid. The first indication we are pursuing for VX-548 is moderate to severe acute pain, and we see this segment of the market as a specialty market that fits the Vertex commercialization model well. But the mechanism is applicable to other types of pain, as demonstrated by VX-150 which showed positive POC across acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. We look forward to discussing plans in these indications on future calls.\nI am very excited about our continued progress in bringing our CF medicines to more patients globally and about the promise of our late-stage pipeline. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Stuart.\nVertex is off to an excellent start in 2022 as our R&D pipeline continued to deliver significant milestones, and we again delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter. First quarter total product revenues were $2.1 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nOur growth was again primarily driven by new patients coming on therapy compared to the prior year, including continued robust uptake of KAFTRIO internationally, following expanded reimbursement access in a number of geographies over the past year as well as continued growth of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Our first quarter 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $687 million compared to $531 million in Q1 2021. The year-over-year increase in expenses was driven by increased research costs and investments in our advancing pipeline with multiple programs now in mid- and late-stage development. Additionally, we continue to make investments in CTX001 pre-commercial activities in anticipation of regulatory filing by the end of this year.\nStarting in the first quarter of 2022 and going forward, consistent with reporting practices that have been recently adopted by peer companies, we no longer exclude from our non-GAAP results, research and development charges from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions or the licensing of third-party IP. We have also updated prior year reported non-GAAP figures to be consistent with the new basis of presentation. This change in reporting affects only our non-GAAP numbers and the impacts on reported results for Q1 '22 and Q1 '21 were not material.\nOur continued strong revenue growth combined with our efficient operating model resulted in Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of 56% and non-GAAP operating income of $1.17 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was 22%. We ended the quarter with $8.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as we continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet profile.\nNow to guidance. We are maintaining our previously issued guidance for full year 2022 CF product revenue and non-GAAP effective tax rate. We are adjusting our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to reflect the change in reporting of upfronts and milestones as I described moments ago. Specifically, our guidance for total CF product revenue remains at $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. At the midpoint, this is a year-over-year increase of approximately $1 billion or 12% growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses are now projected in a range of $2.82 billion to $2.92 billion, including potential upfront and milestone payments from existing or ongoing collaborations.\nFinally, we continue to project a non-GAAP effective tax rate in a range of 21% to 22%. As we look out to the remainder of the year and into 2023, we have a number of important pipeline milestones that will demonstrate our continued progress, and these are shown on Slide 16 of the webcast.\nIn summary, we are on track for our 8th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth in 2022. The CF business is strong, and we have invested to maintain leadership in CF for the long term. At the same time, we are now going through an inflection point as a company well on our way to diversifying Vertex into new disease areas beyond CF as the broad pipeline of potentially transformative medicines advances. As a result, our unique business strategy, which enables significant reinvestment in internal and external innovation while sustaining high profitability leaves us exceptionally well-positioned for further significant value creation over time. We look forward to updating you further as we progress through the year.\nLet's now open the call to questions.",

This is Michael Partridge. Welcome to the Vertex Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. On tonight's call, making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website.\nWe will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties under the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance we will review on the call this evening are non-GAAP.\nI will now turn the call over to Dr. Reshma Kewalramani.\n\nReshma Kewalramani\n\nCEO, President & Director, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Michael. I'm pleased to discuss our performance and progress in 2021 and to share our vision for where Vertex is headed. 2021 was a very important year for the company, during which we expanded our leadership position in CF, significantly advance the mid- and late-stage pipeline and further strengthened our financial position, and one which sets us up for high-value milestones in our revenue and earnings continue to reflect the significant growth of 4 CF patients, we again delivered exceptional financial results, generating nearly $7.6 billion in product revenues, representing 22% growth year-on-year and 27% growth over Q4 2020.\nAlso in 2021, we initiated 2 global Phase III studies with our next-in-class CF regimen, VX-121, tezacaftor VX-561, completed enrollment in the pivotal studies of CTX001 and deliver proof of concept with VX-147 in a type of APOL1-mediated kidney disease known as FSGS, delivered early, but very promising results with VX-880 in type 1 diabetes and advance VX-548 into 2 proof-of-concept studies in acute pain. The results of which are expected this quarter.\nThe cell therapies and 6 disease areas, including CF. Fueled by our success in cystic fibrosis, our financial profile and balance sheet have been further strength external innovation and industry-leading operating margins. We provided a detailed overview of Vertex at our webcast 2 weeks ago at the JPMorgan conference. Tonight, our prepared remarks will recap the high points around our CF franchise and our pipeline and also review our commercial performance and financial expectations for 2022, starting with CF.\nFor the 90% of CF patients who can benefit from a CFTR modulator, we see continued significant growth ahead as we have more than 25,000 patients who could benefit from TRIKAFTA and our other CF medicines but who are not yet on treatment. Stuart will discuss the opportunity ahead of us and our high confidence that we will reach these patients in his prepared remarks.\nApproved first in the U.S. in October of 2019, TRIKAFTA set a high bar in terms of both clinical trials and real-world data and has become the standard of care for patients with CF today. To recap, in late 2021, we shared 96-week data from the extension of the TRIKAFTA pivotal trial, where we saw no decline in mean lung function. This was the first for any CFTR modulator. We now have the first real-world data for TRIKAFTA from the U.S. CF Foundation registry. Across approximately 16,000 patients treated with Trikafta and represented in the registry in 2020 relative to patients eligible for Tricapta in the year prior to approval, we see an 87% reduction in the risk of lung transplant, a 77% reduction in pulmonary exacerbations, and a 74% reduction in the risk of death.\nNonetheless, if it is possible to deliver better clinical outcomes in TRIKAFTA, we are determined to be the ones who do so. And our next-in-class triple combination of VX-121, tezacaftor 561, which holds that potential is already in pivotal development. We expect completion of enrollment in both Phase III Skyline trial in late 2022 or early 2023. This combination has the potential for greater clinical benefit, more convenient once-daily dosing, and a significantly lower royalty obligation.\nFor the last 10% of CF patients who do not make any CFTR protein with our partners at Moderna, we've now demonstrated that we can not only efficiently deliver full-length CFTR mRNA to human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, but also to bronchial epithelial cells in nonhuman primates, solving a long-standing delivery challenge and marking a significant step forward in bringing a treatment for the last 10% of CF patients. Based on these results, IND-enabling studies for our CFTR mRNA program are now underway. We plan to file the IND this year with clinical trials beginning thereafter.\nBeyond CF, we have a pipeline that is broad and deep and delivering and considerably more advanced compared to a year ago. I'll review a few of our clinical stage programs, each of which is a first-in-class or best-in-class program has the potential to serve a large number of patients and represents a multibillion dollar opportunity.\nBeginning with CTX001, our onetime gene editing treatment with the potential to provide a functional cure for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. This is our most advanced program outside of CF, and we expect this will be our next commercial launch.\nWe're wrapping up discussions with regulators to finalize our submission data package for CTX001, including the number of patients and duration of follow-up. This program accelerated significantly last year based on strong physician and patient interest. We completed enrollment in both Phase III studies, both were oversubscribed. And to date, we've dosed more than 70 patients. We look forward to sharing more clinical data with CTX001 longer-term follow-up and many more patients at a medical forum later this year, on the way to our planned global regulatory filings by year-end 2022.\nMoving on to VX-147 and the APOL1-mediated kidney disease program. In renal medicine, one of the most important genetic discoveries of the last decade was the realization that mutations in the APOL1 gene are a key driver of significant kidney disease. VX-147, our small molecule inhibitor specifically targets this APOL1 protein. And in so doing, targets the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease.\nIn the Phase II single-arm study of 16 patients with APOL1-mediated FSGS, VX-147 demonstrated unprecedented reductions in proteinuria, a marker of kidney damage and was generally well tolerated. Importantly, the 47.6% mean reduction in proteinuria was on top of standard of care. These Phase II results propel the advancement of VX-147 into pivotal development. Our next step is an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA, and our goal is to initiate pivotal development, targeting the broad AMKD population of approximately 100,000 patients including, but not limited to those with APOL1-mediated FSGS later this quarter.\nTurning to type 1 diabetes and VX-880. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic il cells and we have known for some time that whole pay increase or cadaveric il cell transplantation can be curative. The challenge has been quality and quantity of donor tissue. We believe we've overcome this challenge. We are the only company that has shown we can make allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated insulin-producing il cell and make them at industrial scale.\nOur goal with our type 1 diabetes program is to develop a functional cure for this disease, including for the more than 2.5 million people living with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe. We shared day 150 results approximately 2 weeks ago from the first patient treated with VX-880. This patient had severe, long-standing type 1 diabetes and prior treatment with VX-880 had difficult to control sugar levels and multiple severe hypoglycemic events with no detectable endogenous insulin as measured by C-peptide. He had a hemoglobin A1c of 8.6% and was taking 34 units of exogenous insulin daily.\nThe results from this first patient treated with half the targeted dose of VX-880 are remarkable. Fasting C-peptide, a measure of endogenous insulin production is now over 400 picomole, Hemoglobin A1c is down to 6.7%. And the patient is on minimal exogenous insulin. VX-880 was generally well tolerated and the patient remains free of symptomatic hypoglycemic events since the (inaudible) period.\nI mentioned at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month, and it bears repeating why these results are so foundational. Achieving durable results in type 1 diabetes requires 2 things: high-quality insulin-producing aisle cells, we have that; and a method to protect these cells from the immune system.\nWe can address the immune response in several different ways. Today, with VX-880, we're combining the stem cell islets with standard immunosuppression in the Phase I/II study. We can shield the same stem cell islets with an immunoprotective device. In this approach, immunosuppressives would not be needed. This approach is in IND-enabling studies, and we expect to file the IND later this year with clinical trials beginning thereafter. And in earlier stages, we're using gene editing technology to make so-called hypoimmune pancreatic islets, yet another approach that eliminates the need for immunosuppressive.\nThe VX-880 Phase I/II clinical trial is up and running at multiple sites. The trial continues to enroll in dose patients. We anticipate sharing data from more patients and longer duration of follow-up this year.\nI'll conclude the pipeline overview with VX-548, a novel selective inhibitor of NaV1.8, which is in clinical proof-of-concept studies for acute pain. Two proof-of-concept studies in acute pain were initiated in the second half of 2021, one in patients following abdominoplasty surgery, and one in patients following bunionectomy. These studies are dose-ranging, placebo-controlled studies and both include an opioid reference arm. The abdominoplasty study has now completed enrollment and dosing and the bunionectomy study will complete in the coming weeks. We anticipate having results from both studies this quarter and announcing both results together.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Stuart.\n\nStuart A. Arbuckle\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Reshma. I'm pleased to review tonight our continued strong commercial performance. Our CF business performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and for the full year in 2021. Our Q4 global revenues were $2.07 billion. Full year revenues were $7.6 billion, an increase of 22% over 2020.\nU.S. CF product revenues grew 10% to $5.3 billion in 2021, driven mainly by the launch of TRIKAFTA in the 6- to 11-year-old patient population following its approval last June. Our product revenues outside the U.S. increased 66% over 2020 to $2.3 billion. We signed more than 15 new reimbursement agreements in 2021. And following these agreements, we have seen strong uptake of KAFTRIO and TRIKAFTA matching the launch dynamics in the U.S.\nLooking to the future in 2022 and for the next several years, we expect significant continued revenue growth. As there are more than 25,000 patients remaining who are addressable with our CFTR modulators, but who are not yet treated. These patients fall into 3 categories: Patients who have not yet initiated treatment, largely in countries where we are recently reimbursed and therefore, are early in the launch curve. This includes countries such as Canada, Spain and the Netherlands; patients in geographies where we are not yet reimbursed such as Australia; and finally, younger patients who will be addressed through ongoing label expansions.\nWe continue to make progress in addressing younger and younger patients. As examples, we secured approval for KAFTRIO in 6- to 11-year-old patients in Europe and the U.K. just a few weeks ago. And our submission for approval of TRIKAFTA in these younger patients is also currently under review in Canada. And in 2022, we plan to file for approval for ORKAMBI in patients 12 to 24 months of age in the U.S. and Europe based on the recently completed Phase III study.\nIn addition, with our mRNA program in IND-enabling studies, we are making real progress in developing a medicine for the additional 5,000-plus patients that we cannot address with our current CFTR medicines, but who are potentially addressable with the successful development of an mRNA therapy.\nThe recent long-term and real-world data, as discussed by Reshma in her prepared remarks, have significantly strengthened our competitive position and highlight the benefits of our medicines for CF patients. For a genetic disease like CF, where patients start medicines at an early age and take them chronically over their lifetime, long term and real-world data like these are incredibly important to patients and physicians. They take many years and thousands of patients to generate and set a very high bar for any future therapy to meet.\nI would now like to provide a commercial perspective on 2 programs that are in or entering pivotal development that highlight our future diversification beyond cystic fibrosis.\nI'll start with CTX001, our CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy for hemoglobinopathies, which we plan to file for regulatory approval before the end of this year. In terms of market opportunity, we see tremendous potential for CTX001. We estimate that there are more than 150,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have beta thalassemia or sickle cell disease. Approximately 32,000 of whom have severe disease. 25,000 of these are patients with severe sickle cell disease, and the vast majority of these are in the U.S.\nPublished physician surveys in the U.S. consistently indicate that they expect 1/4 to 1/3 of their sickle cell disease patients would be good candidates for a onetime curative approach using the current busulfan based conditioning regimen, which is in line with our own estimates of the numbers of severe patients.\nWith global regulatory submissions planned for CTX001 toward the end of this year, our launch preparation activities are well underway, including building our market access, patient support and health care professional-facing teams as well as finalizing our manufacturing and supply chain network.\nFinally, as Reshma noted, we plan to advance VX-147 to pivotal development this quarter. So I would like to comment on the opportunity we see in APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD. In the Phase II study, we enrolled patients with 2 APOL1 mutations who had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, FSGS, as demonstrated by biopsy. This was an ideal population to test the clinical hypothesis of APOL1 inhibition. There are approximately 10,000 patients with APOL1-mediated FSGS. However, we estimate that the population of people with 2 APOL1 mutations and kidney disease primarily driven by APOL1 is much larger, approximately 100,000 patients. This is the initial target population that we will seek to address with VX-147, and so this represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nAwareness of diagnosis and genotyping of patients with AMKD are all low. So in parallel with the planned progression of VX-147 to pivotal development in 2022, we expect to begin increasing awareness of APOL1-mediated kidney disease with treating physicians with a focus on the importance of genotyping.\nI'll close by noting that we are about to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the approval of our first CF medicine, KALYDECO. It has been an extraordinary 10 years as we have developed and launched not only KALYDECO, but 3 additional transformative medicines to address the underlying cause of disease for CF patients. I'm excited for the opportunity in 2022 to bring TRIKAFTA KAFTRIO to even more patients around the globe. And the potential to commercialize multiple potentially transformative therapies outside of CF in the near future, starting with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.\nI will now turn it over to Charlie.\n\nCharles F. Wagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\n\nThanks, Stuart. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Vertex continued to demonstrate very strong financial performance. Fourth quarter total product revenues were $2.07 billion, a 27% increase compared to Q4 of 2020. I would note that it is typical for channel inventory to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And in Q4 2021, revenues benefited from moderately higher channel inventory. We expect these inventory levels to normalize in Q1 of 2022. Our full year revenues of $7.6 billion, represents an increase of 22% compared to 2020 revenues of $6.2 billion. 2021 revenue growth was driven by strong international uptake of KAFTRIO and 6 to 11 uptake of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. And with full year sales of $5.7 billion, TRIKAFTA-KAFTRIO now represents 75% of total company revenues.\nOther notable milestones are that the U.S. CF product sales exceeded $5 billion for the first time and ex-U.S. CF product sales exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Our fourth quarter 2021 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $703 million compared to $539 million for 2020, and our full year expenses were $2.33 billion compared to $1.98 billion in 2020.\nIncreased expenses were driven by investment in our research pipeline, advancement of multiple mid- and late-stage clinical programs, incremental costs for our growing CF business and investments in pre-commercial activities for CTX001. Our continued revenue growth, combined with disciplined spending, resulted in a 2021 operating margin of 57% and non-GAAP operating income of $4.34 billion, an increase of 24% compared to 2020. Our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 came in at 21%.\nWith continued revenue growth and profitability, we finished 2021 with $7.5 billion in cash. And consistent with our corporate strategy, our top priority for capital deployment is reinvestment in innovation both internally and our R&D programs and externally, with business development aligned to our R&D strategy. We have invested approximately $3 billion in collaborations and acquisitions since 2019. Additionally, we have made more than $2 billion in share repurchases to offset dilution over that same time frame.\nNow to guidance. Our 2021 performance reflected strong uptake for TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and for KAFTRIO in multiple countries around the world. For 2022, we project that we will achieve total product revenues of $8.4 million to $8.6 billion. At the midpoint, that's an increase of nearly $1 billion or 12% growth over 2021.\nI'd like to remind you, as is our practice, this guidance reflects our expectations for approved products in countries where we have already secured reimbursement. For non-GAAP OpEx, we are guiding to a range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion. Consistent with our innovation strategy, we expect to continue to allocate greater than 70% of our OpEx to R&D with year-over-year growth largely driven by investment in our pipeline in order to advance key programs through mid- and late-stage development. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2022 to be in the range of 21% to 22%.\nIn closing, 2021 was a very important and successful year for the company. We significantly expanded our leadership position in CF by treating more patients, generating key long-term and real-world data, advancing the next-in-class CFTR modulator program into Phase III, and continuing to innovate for all CF patients. We also accelerated our R&D pipeline in 2021 and obtained key data readouts across multiple programs and multiple modalities.\nWe further strengthened our financial position, enabling continued investment in internal and external innovation while delivering industry-leading operating margins. Most importantly, these advances set the foundation which positions us for multiple milestones and significant value creation in 2022 and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we progress through the year. Let's now open the call to questions.",

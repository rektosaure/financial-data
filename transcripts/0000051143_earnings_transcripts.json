P gets monetized based on hardware installed Mips.\n\nUsage.\n\nI already said two quarters in albeit early.\n\nWe're a 130% program the program and Z 17 off of a Z 16 was that was the most successful program in the history of IBM, we're at 130%. So I do my math and calculation.\n\nHigher capacity opportunity.\n\nIt's higher monetization opportunity creates higher price opportunity creates higher value creation opportunities. So I think when you look at it we feel pretty good about delivering our model in software.\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nYour next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nHey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just one quick clarification question. There Arvind the growth rates you just provided and the response to that question for 2026 or into 2026 I. Just wanted to confirm those were all organic growth rates or whether they included M&A embedded in them.\n\nAnd then my question just taking a step back Arvind is we've seen cloud providers experience exceptional growth recently, particularly in infrastructure services and large scale AI workloads.\n\nHow does IBM view that trend and do you see a similar opportunity for IBM cloud to capture long term infrastructure driven demand. Thanks.\n\nOkay.\n\nThe growth rates that we've talked about we tend not to do much M&A or any.\n\nIn both.\n\nOur mainframe.\n\nTPS as well as in some of the other areas.\n\nThe growth rates I mentioned I would call it.\n\nare largely organic without having any significant M&A tuck.\n\nTuck in small M&A, probably all included in there Eric but if we do anything substantial it would help accelerate those those growth rates. So, let's just put it that way I'll also let a.\n\nJim comment on it after I talk about the cloud opportunity.\n\nWe actually partner deeply with all of the Hyperscale is.\n\nAre things that we haven't talked about it but certainly no secret.\n\nFor example, we are one of all weaves large clients with older tend to use a lot of infrastructure.\n\nAt AWS.\n\nAWS.\n\nAt Azure as well as the GCB.\n\nSo as opposed to that it's an opportunity for us.\n\nEric.\n\nWe got a huge opportunity to ruble consulting projects as well as deploy our software on those infrastructures for our clients as an example, if I take one of our very large health insurance clients.\n\nThey think through where they're going to deploy their AI models. They do not like deploying in a public instance.\n\nOver define getting a private instance, in a cloud and deploying models, they're deploying all our software stacks, there and getting growth. So we tend to do that we.\n\nWe also tend to in some cases.\n\nFor example, with Brock we're deploying Brock.\n\nPeoples.\n\nOne data centers. So that's a big opportunity that comes there that will show up in revenue for us both in .\n\nSalting as well as in our software because on top of the infrastructure, we tend to put our software stacks in some instances so it's less about.\n\nI was getting an opportunity in our cloud only but much more.\n\nGrowth vector that we are able to ride and that helped increase overall growth rate in both software as well as in consulting and lastly, let's not forget our biggest beneficiary of AI infrastructure is our mainframe and our storage portfolio at this time.\n\nLatest generation mainframe.\n\nWill surprise you with some of the numbers.\n\nThis quarter.\n\nfully populated single system.\n\nIs capable of doing 450 billion influences per day at.\n\nAs clients purchased that capability that'll be border further accelerated to mainframe infrastructure growth, but it also comes with a software stack that helps them do all of that influencing if I look at our storage portfolio.\n\nMany people have realized you need a lot of storage to be able to do AI training and we are going to be beneficiaries of that inside our storage portfolio as people deploy that so much more to say we are actually the direct beneficiary of the hyperscale or growth of AI capability and capacity as.\n\nTo use this capability and do we will be a beneficiary and our mainframe and storage stock in a direct way.\n\nI think that that would I hope Erik address that part of the question.\n\nEric and just to the numbers piece I mean first of all.\n\nWe are all focused here.\n\nExecute a very important fourth quarter to finish a very successful 2025 for IBM, but.\n\nArvind and I are given some color about 26 about the confidence we have in our portfolio, but let me just take a step back and remind you on software our software model shared in Investor day approaching double digits.\n\nThat is all in that has two to three points give or take it each year may be a point more than maybe a point less depending on our disciplined capital allocation around M&A of inorganic.\n\ncontribution and 6% to seven to eight points of organic when you look at 2025, you go do the math, we're probably going to be approaching 6% organic growth overall, and we're going to have somewhere three to four points. This year, because we took advantage of a very strategic opportunity with Hershey Corp. This year.\n\n.\n\nBut when you take a look at 'twenty.\n\n26.\n\nGP growth monetization value that I talked about the red hat accelerated growth profile thats on our revenue under contract. The annuity growth profile that is approaching are now going to be double digits at the exiting the year.\n\nEach of those are going to fuel that organic growth engine. Overall, so I think big picture. The model is pretty much what we kind of look at right now for 2026.\n\nOkay, operator, let's take the next question.\n\nYour next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nGood evening. Thanks for taking my question I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about M&A from a target perspective. You've previously stated that you are looking to accelerate growth and youre looking for things that fit strategically with our portfolio, but on the margin anything in any way your thinking.\n\nDifferently about the portfolio or the product piece of it or the potential size of transaction you might like undertaken specifically when you consider undertaking a somewhat larger more transformative transaction.\n\nMaybe not quite as big as you did with Red hat, but I'll sort of a similar scale relative to your overall portfolio. Thank you.\n\nJim Thanks for the question look M&A is extremely important part of our strategy.\n\nI want to just perhaps.\n\nPerhaps reiterate because this has come up on prior calls as well.\n\nWe look at it always in a multi year window. So we've got to look at waters, our excess cash flow over a few years and once we have that window that means we can sort of buy ahead, which means we can sort of lean in or if we don't find a good target like we Didnt for example, I think in 2023.\n\nThen we actually spent much less than we could have.\n\nJust a backdrop to the amount of financial flexibility that we have which if I remember at our Investor day earlier. This year, we laid out that we have somewhere in the mid twenties, perhaps a bit more flexibility over a three year window, that's kind of a way to sort of look at it.\n\nNext.\n\nWe are very focused on.\n\nOn the areas that we have already explained as a strategy a very top level, we say hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.\n\nAt Grand slips into our hybrid portfolio, our automation portfolio, and our data and AI portfolio and you've seen us.\n\nDo acquisitions in there.\n\nFor example, we bought.\n\nA company that does BLM, but it fit into our hybrid portfolio, because it's a direct part of the red hat and portfolios.\n\nWe did.\n\nHershey cough, which fits directly into automation with a data stacks, which fits into data.\n\nWhen I look at the target lists there is I think a pretty rich list of opportunities that are out there in the private markets and the world in the public markets across those opportunities that we think.\n\nWell.\n\nSome of them will be actionable, it's hard to predict upfront, which are and which are not so I think that if I put it that way and just to be clear.\n\nAnything that is of size has to fit three criteria.\n\nIt has to fit with the strategy, we just laid out.\n\nThere has to be synergy.\n\nThe growth rate inside IBM will be above what it was as a standalone entity some of that come from our geography spread we have a sales team in most countries in the world.\n\nIf it comes by the ability to bundle more attractive offerings together and it come from faster deployment for example, leveraging our consulting team or the rest of our sales team all three will be able to add.\n\nTwo more.\n\nFaster growth rate third if it is of size and we are very disciplined also that we like it to become accretive.\n\nSo cash by the end of the second year. So those other criteria, but as you've seen we have found plenty in the last few years that do fit that.\n\nThat all criteria, so I hope that that.\n\nGives you a sense now your question on larger I'll, just use that word larger.\n\nWe will never rule anything out, but it has to meet all the criteria that we just laid out it is not precise alone.\n\nRed hat allowed us to enter a new space.\n\nAccelerate ibm's overall, great growth rate by the way both in software and consulting.\n\nSo that was the start of the synergy piece that was there and you. Many people forget that also had a very attractive free cash flow profile that we have been able to leverage since the acquisition.\n\nGreat Opera.\n\nLater, let's take one final question.\n\nThank you and that question comes from Brian Essex with J P. Morgan. Please state your question.\n\nHi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question Arvind maybe as a follow up as part of Eric's question and I. Appreciate your hard hybrid exposure here, but can you could you generalize what youre seeing with regard to mix as enterprises focus on AI readiness, our cloud native Isps Isd based agenda applications may.\n\nWe targeted a task and point solution automation are those low hanging fruit to prove ROI before pursuing self hosted projects and then maybe.\n\nWithin the it budgets where is the spending coming from what's at risk of getting trimmed as companies focused on and focus on adopting AI based technology.\n\nSo Brian let me address the first part of your question was a bit of.\n\nDeb.\n\nI actually think that these are in and are people going to leverage RSV although.\n\n.\n\nI'll call it SaaS applications, while getting exposure to AI and agents either as part of those entities or as added value onto them and there are hundreds if not thousands of little boutique companies that provide some of those agents that are out there I think they will absolutely do that they'll kick the tires on it they'll get some value.\n\nBut at the end of the day.\n\nTo get real value from AI people have to be able to integrate their existing applications. How do they tie what is happening in the payroll system and HR system to perhaps something that is happening in the CRM system to perhaps something that is happening in their ERP system as people begin to want to build.\n\nMuch more profound agents that is where a lot of the action that we see is happening as people try to build those agents out there and they get deeply concerned about what does that data, whereas the data going and they're going to apply those either in their own data centers or in a private instance.\n\nNot a private instance of the cloud is quite protected and people do deploy a lot of critical applications that are there, but if I think about our clients.\n\nIn the regulated industries banking and insurance still is very much a data center as well as the cloud picture if I look at healthcare.\n\nHealth care data it tends not to go out very much.\n\nTheir own data centers, if I look at telecom most people build their own backbones and their data and obligations reside there, but certain other things like marketing mobile reside in the public cloud. So as we begin to look upon all of that I believe that we are at the very beginning I would actually characterize it Brian.\n\nBut if I was to use a baseball analogy we are still in the first innings of enterprise AI rollout and I expect that we'll be seeing and we will see more.\n\nOur SaaS AI users, we will see more.\n\nPublic cloud usage, and we will begin to see a lot more.\n\nPrivate usage as people begin to get into more critical applications and agents on the .\n\nIt budgets.\n\nSo ivy budgets have been growing ahead of GDP, that's simply an observation.\n\nI think this began four or five years ago, but it budgets are growing typically two to three points ahead of GDP growth.\n\nYou combine that then with inflation because GDP. After all is real not nominal ICI budget stay healthy. So a lot of the growth comes from the fact that the budgets are growing as opposed to other cros or something else that said I think people are getting very very effective at trying to run and maintain.\n\nWith lower costs, and putting more money towards zero projects.\n\n10 years ago that ratio used to be 70, 30 70 on running what is 30 on new I think that is shifting more towards a 60 40.\n\nSpread and where it will go is where we'll get the benefit that is why our automation portfolio and our hybrid portfolio get a lot more growth because people are using that.\n\nIt's sort of substituting for labor and in some cases for services by letting those capabilities moving to software.\n\nGreat Operator, I think we have time for one last question.\n\nThank you and the next question comes from Mark Newman with Bernstein. Please state your question.\n\nAlright, Thanks for taking my question.\n\nGood to see the growing book of business and.\n\nThanks for those comments just now Arvind I don't think you've given any specific breakdown yet on the breakdown between software and consulting.\n\nBook of business is there any.\n\nClarity on that I think it used to be 80, 20, I just wanted to clarify there is any.\n\nOn the clarity you have given on that today.\n\nAnd then a follow up on consulting.\n\nI think that's two quarters in a row now.\n\nWe are seeing the book to Bill ratio a touch below one.\n\nI know you point in the earnings to a book to Bill ratio greater than one if you're looking at the trailing 12 months.\n\nBut I would just like to understand more on the shorter term basis last six months. It seems like the book to Bill ratio is below one and if you could explain kind of.\n\nWhy maybe why that's the case why we shouldnt be worried.\n\nEspecially considering I think around 30% of signings you mentioned, our AI, which I believe are longer duration, so just little bit of clarity around consulting and how plays into the to the book to Bill ratio in that recent number being below one would be appreciate it thanks very much.\n\nOkay. Marc this is Jim I'll take both of those let's start with the second one first and then I'll come back to your Claire for quick clarification question on Gen and in particular around the software portfolio overall, and I want to dive a little bit deeper than that but.\n\nWe take a look at consulting, let's dial back 90 days ago.\n\nWe surprised many just compared to what many other consulting companies have been talking about publicly we talked about green shoots that we saw entering second half.\n\nBut I think at that time, we were prudently cautious about how we were going to monitor client buying behaviors and we didn't expect growth in the second half. Although we saw many green shoots overall now we posted I think a marked inflection point of consulting back to growth up 2%.\n\nAnd it's been driven by what we're seeing is continued opportunity for growth as clients accelerate investment in AI driven transformation, what we've been talking about on many of these questions here why companies are looking to unlock efficiency business model innovation and growth gross growth and AI is accelerating over.\n\nWe're all when we take a look at right now fourth quarter and more importantly, early parts of 'twenty six we again see momentum around those key metrics our backlog position.\n\nOur journey I book strategic partnerships and around productivity.\n\nBacklog $31 billion healthy growing 4% right now.\n\nOur best ever.\n\nErosion and I think multiple years, what does that say clients commitment to IBM consulting the quality of our delivery and the value of our differentiated offerings are doing extremely well now to your point about signings signings were down 5% by the way things went down.\n\nFive of the last six quarters, something like that but as I've said many times before why don't I start with backlog that to me is the most.\n\nCritical component that's closest to the outcome measure the outcome measure is revenue revenue growth revenue growth deserving always likes to say in this conference room with our operating team indicators, our backlog indicators, our signings signings are not all equal in those signings numbers had been driven down.\n\nWe posted down 5% based on lower large deal renewal volume by the way I would argue that's.\n\nFirst no revenue realization and probably worst.\n\nDilutive for revenue because your renewals typically drive more price.\n\nMore productivity, but underneath that what do we see and we're seeing a tremendous improvement in the quality of our signings our net new business penetration again, another quarter in a row up double digits year to year on our penetration over 300, new clients year to date fueling our backlog our backlog realizations up over four.\n\nyear over year.\n\nAnd when we take a look at our backlog run out it's pretty healthy growing at market level growth rates here over the next 369 12 months a lot of work still to do to sell and bill within quarter, but a lot of good indicators in that journey I to your point.\n\nOver 22% of our backlog, 30% of our signings, 12% of our revenue that's what's inflect in the growth overall, so we feel pretty good and that's why we called the market inflection and we said we're going to grow consulting here in the fourth quarter, and we feel pretty good about getting back to market growth levels in 2020.\n\nSix now Gen AI.\n\nOver $9 $5 billion book of business, Arvind already talked about over $7 $5 billion in consulting well over 1 billion and a half dollars.\n\nApproaching $2 billion in software.\n\nSeven eight quarters in here that number might vary quarter by quarter as far as the composition.\n\nBut we're still pretty damn close to that 2080 overall, but the underpinnings behind that of the software in the generation.\n\nYou see that play out and how it's accelerating automation growth, but also red hat I know theres been a lot of questions around Red hat, Let me just spend a minute just to close the call on Red hat Red hat, we delivered 12% growth we were down a couple of points quarter to quarter and year to date, we're at 13% low teens right, let me breakdown.\n\nAnd some of the performance one from a position of strength in Arvin talked about a few points open shift up nearly 40% bookings.\n\nOur , one $8 billion up mid year over year accelerating profile virtualization now we've closed total contract value of bookings over $400 million, we got a $700 million pipeline over the next five plus quarters and.\n\nAnsible, 20% bookings in the quarter accelerating to high teens, so what happened on the sequential decline one as we knew we were facing tougher comparison on the consumption based services that impacted us by about a point and ROE above 50% of our portfolio we have.\n\nTalking about we've been growing ROE abnormally in the mid teens.\n\nWe reverted back to our model growing 6% and had about a point now taken a step back right.\n\nRed hat models mid teens, and when you look at it or 80% subs business, we got to grow low end to that high teens.\n\nConsumption base, we got to grow high single digits. When you look at our year to date in Arvin talked about our bookings year to date, we're well position on that subscription base a business growing high teens already on bookings.\n\nAnd when you look at that six 912 month revenue under contract we're accelerating net growth as we go into 26 that gives us confidence in that acceleration comment that Arvind talked about and I talked about is qualitative statements about confidence in 'twenty six and when.\n\nYou look at fourth quarter, let's put this in perspective, we're going to accelerate red hat growth in 25, it's going to be a nice acceleration on the subs and we got about a two point headwind on consumption based services, we knew about that because last year, we grew consumption based services high teens.\n\nAnd when you look at fourth quarter, we're going to wrap on that we've known about that all year long. So when we look at fourth quarter double digit solid double digit growth in red hat low teen growth for the year nice composition of where that acceleration is but the most important thing we're well positioned for 2026.\n\nSo with that I'll turn it back over to Arvind to close out the call. Thanks, Jim.\n\nTo close out we are pleased with our performance this quarter.\n\nAll of our segments accelerated sequentially.\n\nOur portfolio strength business model.\n\nAnd relentless focus on productivity reinforced our confidence in the trajectory I look forward to sharing our progress as we close out the year. Thank you Arvind operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\n\nThank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended you may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Olympia McNerney, IBM's Global Head of Investor Relations. Olympia, you may begin.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Q2 2025 Earnings Presentation. I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman, President, and CEO, and Jim Cavanaugh, IBM's SVP and CFO. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow to provide additional information to our investors. Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us today. In the Q2 we delivered solid results across revenue, profit, and cash exceeding our expectations. Our performance this quarter was led by software and infrastructure. As demand remains high for technology that improves productivity, reduces costs, and fuels innovation while the operating environment remains dynamic. These results reflect the strength of our portfolio and the resiliency of our business model. Before I get deeper into the results, let me touch on the broader economic backdrop. I'll start by saying that we appreciate the administration's priority on economic growth and focused regulation which will strengthen the US competitive position. We believe this will result in long-term value creation and enable technology to contribute to economic growth.\nTechnology continues to serve as a key competitive advantage allowing businesses to scale, drive efficiencies, and fuel growth, and we saw this play out in the quarter. While not a major factor overall, geopolitical tensions are prompting a few clients to move cautiously. US federal spending was also somewhat constrained in the H1, but we do not expect it to create long-term headwinds. Let me now turn to our execution in the quarter. Our strategy remains focused: hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. This strategy is built on five reinforcing elements: client trust, flexible and open platforms, sustained innovation, deep domain expertise, and a broad ecosystem. Together they form a flywheel for growth, which again played out this quarter in software. We continue to see momentum, including 14% growth in Red Hat.\nHashiCorp is also off to a great start, accelerating performance in our first full quarter since closing and seeing early wins with joint Ansible and Terraform product synergies. Infrastructure was up 11% driven by a very strong start to z17. The new IBM Z is an embodiment of the hybrid cloud and AI capabilities we bring to clients. IBM Z continues to deliver on its core strengths, AI, security, and scalable capacity, driving its enduring nature with clients. These results were balanced by consulting performance, which continues to be impacted by the demand environment.\nAI remains a powerful driver of transformation for our clients and for IBM. We are transforming our enterprise operations using technology and embedding AI across more than 70 workflows, leveraging our own IBM software solutions across hybrid cloud, automation, and AI to drive competitive advantage. What differentiates IBM is the breadth of our AI offerings with an innovative technology stack and consulting business at scale and our Client Zero lens. Our GenAI book of business now stands at over $7.5 billion inception to date. With momentum accelerating quarter over quarter, we are seeing strong demand for our AI agents and assistants, RHEL AI, Granite models as well as an accelerating need for our consulting services to deploy AI. Just last week, IBM was recognized as an Emerging Leader in the first ever Gartner Emerging Market Quadrant for GenAI consulting and implementation services.\nOur client zero experience has resonated with companies like UPS, Verizon, Mizuho, and Nestlé. While using our AI tools to unlock data, drive automation, and reduce operational friction. As clients focus on scaling AI and delivering ROI, our progress on internal productivity is fueling and accelerating our client engagements. We're also expanding our partner ecosystem to deliver AI at scale. This quarter we announced new or deepened collaborations with Oracle, Box, AWS, Salesforce, Microsoft, EY, Finastra, and WPP. Each is aimed at embedding watsonx into core business workflows. At Think 2025 we introduced new capabilities across our portfolio. We launched new features for watsonx Orchestrate, which allows users to build custom AI agents in minutes with no coding required. There are now more than 150 pre-built domain-specific agents in our catalog spanning HR, sales, procurement, and IT.\nOur partners are building on this as well, integrating agents from Oracle, Salesforce, AWS, and others, and Orchestrate supports the full agent lifecycle from building to managing and governing agents across business functions regardless of which AI models they are built with. We expanded watsonx.data to enable our enterprise clients to get easy access and drive value from their trusted unstructured data, and our webMethods Hybrid Integration simplifies how clients connect workflows, APIs, and data across hybrid environments.\nAs Agentic AI matures, we believe it will power over a billion new applications and a massive expansion in code driving a critical need for automation. Our automation portfolio is uniquely positioned to deliver these solutions to clients across hybrid cloud. SAP plans to deploy our high-value automation portfolio including Red Hat Ansible automation platform and HashiCorp, Terraform, and Vault. Highlighting the opportunity we have in product synergies. Innovation also extends to infrastructure. This quarter we launched z17, our most advanced mainframe yet. It features the new Telum II processor delivering more than 450 billion AI inference operations per day with millisecond latency. That means AI models can run directly on transactional workloads and with no external servers needed. The Spyre Accelerator, which will be available in Q4, will enable watsonx Code Assistant for Z and Watson Assistant for Z to run natively on z17.\nAs more than 70% of IBM Z clients continue to expand or maintain capacity, our software stack is bringing even more innovation to IBM Z, including watsonx Code Assistant for Z, watsonx.data, IBM Concert, and HashiCorp Vault. In July we introduced Power11 to deliver the performance, resiliency, and scalability enterprises need to run mission critical data intensive workloads across hybrid environments, and we have announced RISE with SAP on Power11.\nIn quantum, we achieved a major milestone with the deployment of IBM Quantum System Two in Japan in partnership with RIKEN. This marks the first installation outside the United States and underscores our commitment to global leadership in quantum computing. To complement our organic innovation, M&A remains important. We closed the acquisition of DataStax this quarter, adding real-time scalable data capabilities to support AI-driven applications. In closing, we remain focused on consistent execution and long-term growth while the environment remains dynamic. We have a disciplined strategy and a durable business model. Given our H1 performance, we continue to expect accelerating revenue growth to 5% plus and are raising our expectations for free cash flow to above $13.5 billion for the year. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Jim, over to you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. In the Q2, we delivered $17 billion in revenue, $4.7 billion of Adjusted EBITDA, $3.2 billion of operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share of $2.80, and through the H1, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow, our highest H1 free cash flow margin in many years. Our revenue growth mix and productivity drove 200 basis points of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, 16% Adjusted EBITDA growth, and 15% operating earnings per share growth. We exceeded our expectations on revenue, profitability, Adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share, highlighting the strength of our portfolio and resiliency of our business model. Our revenue for the quarter grew over 5% at constant currency. Software grew 8% this quarter as we continue to benefit from our high value and annual recurring revenue base, of which grew to $22.7 billion, up 10% since last year.\nRed Hat growth accelerated one point sequentially to 14%, fueled by another quarter of double-digit ings and demand for our hybrid cloud solutions. We gained market share across each of our key solutions, led by OpenShift growing revenue more than 20% with ARR now at $1.7 billion. Automation grew 14% with HashiCorp off to a strong start. We accelerated ings growth in the first full quarter since closing, fueled by IBM's global go-to-market reach and deepening product and technology synergies that are unlocking new customer value. Data was up 7%, fueled by strength across our AI offerings and transaction processing. Revenue declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting where we are at with our new z17 cycle as clients prioritize hardware spend at the beginning of a new program. As you can see in our strong IBM Z results.\nInfrastructure revenue grew 11% this quarter with hybrid infrastructure up 19% and infrastructure support down 3%. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z was up 67% reflecting early strength in our z17 program as AI use cases are resonating strongly with clients. The success of our launch highlights the enduring nature of the IBM Z platform through the value of our continued innovation around AI workloads, and the realization that hybrid cloud is the dominant architecture. Clients continue to invest in IBM Z because it remains the backbone for mission critical workloads offering unmatched reliability, scalability, security, and performance while seamlessly integrating with hybrid cloud, and AI strategies.\nDistributed infrastructure revenue was down 17% with product cycle dynamics impacting power with the recent announcement of Power11 in July. Power11, our next generation platform, features advancements across the processor, hardware architecture, and virtualization software stack. While storage was impacted by the new IBM Z cycle as clients prioritize hardware spend, our early strength in z17 and the growth in the installed MIPS capacity drives a long-term benefit given the 3 to 4x zStack multiplier.\nConsulting revenue was flat, stabilizing in the H1 and heading into the H2. Our backlog remains healthy, up 4% over last year. Despite the challenging pricing environment in the quarter, intelligent operations revenue grew 2% while strategy and technology declined by 2%. The environment remains dynamic with clients prioritizing cost-efficient, high-impact technology investments, driving good revenue growth in areas like business application transformation, AI operations, and cloud platform engineering and leading to momentum in our consulting generative AI book of business. At over $1 billion in the quarter, this early momentum is important. Engaging with clients as they architect their AI strategies is establishing consulting as the strategic partner of choice, and we are encouraged that through the H1 we are seeing a greater share of GenAI signings tied to new projects.\nDelayed decision making, especially in discretionary projects as well as prior year renewals, impacted our in period signings. However, we're seeing an improvement in strategic wins with new clients and expanding engagements with existing clients. Now turning to profitability during the quarter, the strength of our portfolio mix and productivity execution drove expansion of our operating gross profit margin of 230 basis points, Adjusted EBITDA margin of 200 basis points, and operating pre-tax margin of 110 basis points ahead of our expectations and well above our model. Our productivity initiatives create a flywheel that allows us to invest back in our business both organically and inorganically, increase our financial flexibility, and deliver margin expansion.\nAs we saw this play out again in the quarter, we remain laser focused on driving efficiency and cost savings by leveraging technology and embedding AI in our workflows as well as optimizing our supply chain and service delivery. This quarter we continue to optimize our supply chain by shifting our distributed infrastructure manufacturing to an industry standard strategic partner. This is the next evolution of our supply chain transformation as we pivot to a simpler, more efficient process which helps us optimize cash conversion cycles. Through the H1 we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow up about $300 million, year-over-year, resulting in our highest H1 free cash flow margin in reported history. The largest driver of this growth comes from Adjusted EBITDA up $1 billion year-over-year. Partially offsetting this is working capital.\nGiven global trade dynamics, we continue to prudently protect our supply chain, reflecting the confidence we have in our new innovation cycles across infrastructure, and as we have been discussing, given the closing of HashiCorp acquisition, foregone interest income was another headwind. Despite this, we are a few points ahead of our historical containment levels. Through the H1, our strong liquidity position, solid investment-grade balance sheet, and disciplined capital allocation policy remain a focus for us.\nWe ended the quarter with cash of $15.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the end of 2024, including spending $7.8 billion on acquisitions in the H1, driven largely by the closing of HashiCorp. Our debt balance ending the quarter was $64.2 billion, including $11.7 billion of debt for our financing business with the receivables portfolio that is over 75% investment grade. In addition, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends in the H1.\nNow let me talk about what we are seeing going forward. We delivered strong performance in the H1 across revenue, operating margin expansion, profitability, and earnings per share, and free cash flow. The strength of our portfolio investment in innovation and integrated value drive the durability of our revenue performance and underpin our confidence in accelerating revenue growth of 5%+ for the full year and through the H1. Given the strength in our underlying fundamentals. With our adjusted EBITDA up 14%, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to above $13.5 billion for 2025.\nAs discussed at our Investor Day, our mix shift towards software is a key driver of our growth acceleration. Software is now about 45% of our business with ARR growing 10%. Given the strength of our portfolio investment in innovation and contribution from acquisitions, we continue to expect software revenue growth approaching double digits, too, for the full year. Through the H1, we delivered above-model growth of 15% in automation and in-line model growth of 14% in Red Hat and 7% in data, and these trends should continue, and we continue to expect Red Hat to grow in the mid-teens while transaction processing was flat in the H1 and below our model as clients prioritize spend on our high-value innovation z17. The strength of the new cycle provides future monetization value across the zStack.\nGiven this dynamic, we now expect low single digit growth in transaction processing for the year, with our strong start to z17 infrastructure should contribute about 1.5 points to IBM's revenue growth this year, and in consulting. While we are encouraged by our backlog growing mid single digits, and the continued progress in our GenAI book of business. Given the current demand environment, we continue to be prudently cautious on consulting's growth contribution to IBM this year. As I mentioned earlier, we have been accelerating our productivity initiatives, which is fueling our flywheel for growth and margin expansion. We are early in this Client Zero journey on scaling AI internally to reinvent the way we work and are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us.\nWe exited 2024 at $3.5 billion of annual run rate savings achieved, and we now believe we can achieve approximately $4.5 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Through the H1 of the year, our operating pretax margins have expanded by 90 basis points ahead of our model despite dilution from HashiCorp. Given this performance and increased productivity savings, we are raising our expectations for IBM's full year operating pretax margin to expand by about 1 point, and our tax rate expectation for the year remains in the mid teens. As always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For the Q3, we are comfortable with consensus estimates for revenue and profitability.\nLet me conclude by saying we are pleased with our H1 performance, highlighting the resiliency of our business model, disciplined strategy, and growth opportunities ahead of us. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much. I was hoping you could double click on the software trends. It looks like organic growth decelerated in the quarter to maybe between 3% to 4%. Could you confirm that? And that would imply that it would be the Q3 of software organic growth deceleration. But you just expressed confidence in your approaching 10% guide. So between transaction processing deceleration, maybe Red Hat maintaining it, what are some of the other puts and takes that we should be expecting in the business? And how much should we expect organic software growth to be for the remainder of the year? Thank you so much.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay, Wamsi, thank you for the question. Appreciate it. Let's get right to the heart of this, you dial back to how we opened up the year in January, and then we built on that at our Investor Day in early February. We talked about 2025. We were entering from a position of strength in software. With new innovation we're bringing to market. Strong recurring revenue base, by the way, now $23 billion growing double digits, Red Hat momentum throughout the year, and the opportunity around virtualization and others. GenAI book of business and the M&A growth synergies halfway through the year. Right now we actually feel even more confident about the year approaching double digits. Let me just break this down compared to the Investor Day model around each of our categories.\nOne hybrid cloud, we accelerated our Red Hat performance Q1, Q2 by an incremental point, now growing about 14.5%. By the way, that's contributing about three and a half points of IBM's software revenue growth. All organic, by the way. We continue to see mid-teens growth for the year and contributing about three and a half points. With double-digit growth again in annualized bookings, opportunities around virtualization. By the way, through the first three quarters, we now eclipsed $300 million worth of total bookings around virtualization, and we see that pipeline even accelerating faster in H2. Then you got AI and application hybrid cloud containerization that's going to drive it. So we feel pretty good about Red Hat. Two, automation. Our model on automation is low double digits. We operated through H1 at 15% above model.\nNow underneath that we're contributing about three and a half points of that software growth. We're off to a great start in HashiCorp. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're very excited about the integrated value of that value proposition across IBM + Red Hat + HashiCorp. We 2x the annual bookings in the Q1 underneath IBM, and oh by the way our pipeline in the H2 is 3x last year across our entire automation portfolio with regards to HashiCorp. So we actually expect automation to continue to accelerate throughout the year and we will be well above our model, mid to high-teens against that investor day model. That's going to contribute about an incremental point of growth.\nThird, data. Data, we continue to execute well on GenAI momentum. Now, inception to date, $1.5 billion worth of book of business on software. We're bringing new innovation to market that we showcased at Think. We're building strong pipeline in the H2 that we're confident on, and we have the M&A synergies that are going to play forward both in automation and in data. So we expect that to deliver on model. Now, you come to transaction processing. Transaction processing flat through the H1. That's, by the way, below our model, mid-single-digit, right?\nThat's about a two-point impact through the H1 to software's growth. When you look at it, well, what are we seeing? As we always talk about, transaction processing runs mission-critical software on top of our mainframe platform. We run that mainframe platform as a stack economics play. $3 to 4 a platform multiplier over the cycle. We're off to the strongest ever Q1 start in the history of IBM around mainframe. In a launch quarter, we shipped over 100% MIPS capacity into the marketplace on z17. So while that's having a near-term impact on transaction processing, you saw it down 2% in the quarter. Clients reprioritized their spend to the hardware. Now that will impact near term.\nBut look at what happened on z16. Same thing happened in Q2 last year. And what happened, we accelerated that growth. That's that multiplier effect as we get more capacity in a marketplace, and we expect transaction processing now to be about low single digit. It'll return to growth in H2. So between accelerating growth continued on Red Hat, the automation synergistic value on HashiCorp, transaction processing capitalizing on that multiplier effect of a very strong start on mainframe, we see that organic growth moving forward. And oh by the way, we're comfortable with Q3 guidance and Q3 guidance already accelerates organic growth.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks a lot. Good afternoon everyone. Arvind, I'm hoping you just spend a little bit of time talking about what are you hearing from your customers at this point given what seems to be a very volatile macro tape. And maybe just talk about a few categories where you think customers want to spend more money. They're prioritizing versus things that they might be de-emphasizing a bit. And then very specifically, I'd love to hear your thoughts around Red Hat. Given the strong trajectory you guys are seeing. How do you see virtualization starting to contribute to that growth? Especially given the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom and the price increase. Can you touch on those.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, IBM\n\nI've turned from being, I use the word cautious optimism at the end of the Q1. I would now turn my way all the way to optimism around the macro environment. As you go around the globe, I'll first touch on geography and then touch on some sector or client examples. I think Japan is re-industrializing and they are committed to economic growth for their nation. That implies that Japan is digitizing at rates we have not seen, and digitizing is through the use of technology. If you go across South Asia, they're all booming.\nIn real terms, South Asia is growing at north of 10% because when you think about 6% to 7% GDP growth in India combined with 6% inflation, that means that actual rates, their economies are growing at 10% to 12%. The Middle East, especially Saudi and UAE, they're booming in terms of plowing all of their profits back into their economies, and they're trying to create new diversified economies of which technology forms a strong piece. People have talked a lot about Europe, but Europe has remained remarkably resilient as a technology consumer. I believe the reason for that is that when they look at the concerns around supply chains, they look at the issues around cyber, and they look at their labor demographics. Technology offers them an actual answer against all of those headwinds.\nWe come into North America, and every company is now convinced that technology forms the basis of how do you scale revenue while not spending that much on CapEx and that much on labor expenses. So as you've gone around the globe, those form the backdrops for why enterprise technology is going to remain a strong grower. Somewhere in the 5%, 6%, 7% range, from what we can see. Then if I touch on it in a more client lens, if I think about a bank in Western Europe, they're strongly motivated to begin to use AI on how to improve their customer experience and how to improve their internal risk profiles.\nIf I look at telecom here in the United States, they're looking deeply at how they can have a software-defined backbone for their very high throughput 5G network backbones in order to give themselves more flexibility in how traffic gets routed and to be able to leverage the rate of advancement that comes in standard servers and software.\nAsk me about Red Hat. So Amit, if you'll allow me, I'll go a little bit broader than the virtualization question. First, Red Hat Linux, the core original product of Red Hat, is growing in the high single digits because of extreme demand around people deploying Red Hat in order to be able to leverage AI as well, not just the standard server footprint, which normally I would tell you gives you 6%, 7%, but additional workloads is adding that couple of percent that you're asking about. If we look at OpenShift, it's actually a platform answer. So people are looking for what platform do we use for containers and what platform do we use for virtualization. There were three or four answers in each category. If I look at two of the three competitors on the containerization side, they've taken themselves out of the market in practical terms.\nSo if people are wanting a container platform that goes across public cloud and on-premises, I will tell you that we are the leading answer for that. Every analyst, as an industry analyst, will tell you that if you look at virtualization, there are a few answers, but then there is a set of clients who would prefer a common answer across containerization and virtualization. Then by default we tend to win those that has accelerated the OpenShift piece. Last but not least, as we have brought HashiCorp in and the numbers show through in the HashiCorp product family, but the combination with Ansible is very powerful and is going to boost Ansible as well going forward. So I hope this gives you a bit of color both on the macro and the Red Hat\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey guys, thanks. I wanted to take kind of like. The opposite tack of the first question and. Ask why not, you know, what is causing you not to raise guidance if you feel better about the economy? It looks like free cash flow. Is above your pace; it looks like you're already at 5% plus constant currency. I know that includes an acquisition, and it looks like TPP and a bunch of others may accelerate. So just wondering, is it conservative to say that you're comfortable with the street for the Q3 when all that is looking actually better, and you're already at your 5% plus and already ahead of pace on free cash flow? Thanks a lot.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Ben. I appreciate the question. Overall, let's just ground us in what we're actually saying both in the prepared. Remarks here tonight. Coming off of a H1 which we feel very good and pleased about our performance. I think it talks to how we have fundamentally changed and repositioned this company around a portfolio, a business model, and an execution engine that actually reflects itself in the diversified business model and a durable and resilient business model.\nSo today, number one, we beat street expectations and our own expectations in the quarter on revenue, on operating margin, on profitability, on earnings, and on free cash flow. What are we saying about the full year here now? Tonight, number one, since January, the average analyst estimates have taken up the IBM revenue by well in excess of $1 billion. We've been taking up the year already. We live in an actual world, yes, FX is moving our way.\nBut also in the quarter, our $400 million beat. About $375 million of that was pure business performance in constant currency. So by definition we have confidence entering Q2, and I'll come back to revenue. But we're also then number two, we are taking up the year on our productivity initiatives. We exited last year. We talked about $3.5 billion of productivity that we've been able to fundamentally drive out of this business. This is what Arvind keeps talking about, this productivity mindset that we spent time with all of you at our Think conference about reimagining and reinventing how we run our company. How do we leverage technology, digitization, embed AI across our workflows. We are seeing extreme penetration around that, and that's given us guidance and confidence to raise that to $4.5 billion. That flows to operating margin.\nWe're taking our operating margins up from a half a point to now roughly a point. We're taking our Adjusted EBITDA up because it's all high quality earnings profit that Adjusted EBITDA is now going to be low teens growth. By the way, dollarize that, that's over $2 billion year-to-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA. And then we're flowing that all the way down through to cash flow, high quality, sustainable cash flow generation.\nNow, with all that said, we got a half a year to go. Free cash flow, we got 2/3 of our free cash flow to go. Revenue, we still got, you know, $40 billion worth of revenue to go. We feel confident about the position we're in, the strength of our portfolio, and software double digit annuity revenue around $23 billion book of business. We feel good about infrastructure in the start, and by the way, we took infrastructure up for the year. This is not a pull ahead. A mainframe cyclical demand in that quarter. We took the entire year up. So I would tell you we feel very confident, even more confident than 90 days ago. And yes, we have upside and conservatism, absolutely. But that's what you would expect of us.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please state your question.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you step back and look at the holistic software portfolio. There are a lot of questions on what we're doing for this year. But maybe going forward, heading into 2026, given the impact of some of the businesses and positive tailwinds you talked about, do you think there's potential for improving both organic and overall software growth heading into 2026 from the current 10% levels this year? I mean, I wonder if you think that's possible and then maybe secondarily if you could just address the consulting business and what you're seeing right now in terms of the duration of the bookings you're seeing and whether there's any kind of change in the time to commencement of some of the consulting contracts you're signing. Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, IBM\n\nJim. Thanks for the question, though I did, I think, count three parts in there. Let me address the first part on the software macro going into 2026, and then I'll give it over to our Jim, Jim Cavanaugh, for some of the details there. On consulting, look, I think the question you're asking is one that we spend a lot of time on and one that I'm incredibly confident about. If I look at the underlying macros, all the parts we talked about, Red Hat, I see them maintaining themselves into 2026. This is not unique to this quarter or a month. So I would expect to see that same growth carry on there.\nIf I look at automation that is really driven by the complexity of our clients' technology environments and then them wanting to run them at extremely high resilience, they want to run them at much lower labor cost expense, and the amount of compute to their environments is increasing. So the neat technology we label that automation to go run all that. We can see that the desire to unlock value from all of the data, to unlock data for AI as well as to deploy AI inside the enterprise, which is where we are focused, is going to only accelerate, not decrease. So all those three parts of the portfolio, I would give you equal or higher growth rates going into 2026. Now you come to TP and Jim addressed that TP tends to be slightly lagging with the capacity that is being deployed on mainframes.\nSo as that capacity gets deployed, I would fully expect TP to return to its long-term model, which is in between low and mid single digits. So if you put all that together and then if you add what other M&A we might do, because since you raised that, let me just organic and inorganic. I'm very optimistic about the current M&A environment. Of course all regulators will always watch for misbehavior and for areas where they see too much consolidation. That said, what we've seen over the last four months has made us optimistic that we are now in a rational regulation environment where M&A that makes sense will get approved in reasonable timeframes. So with that, Jim, let me give it to you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah, Jim, thank you for the question overall. Just let me put a bow on Arvind's point about software and bring it up a level to IBM, and then that will lead right into your consulting question if I remember the question overall. But when you look at it, first of all, way too early, we have a lot of work to do. Team is extremely focused on disciplined execution here and delivering and unlocking client value with all the new investments and innovation in the H2 this year. When you look at 2026 at a big picture, I'll reiterate what we said in Investor Day. We feel good about the software portfolio, and Arvind just gave you some of the key KPIs underneath that about how we feel even more confident heading into 2026 with that.\nBut the other big drivers are one GenAI not only software but we've now got north of $7.5 billion book of business and it's generating increased penetration across our portfolio, both software and consulting, which I'll talk on too, our M&A growth synergies. You know we accelerated some opportunistically into this year. We're very excited about the portfolio that we've been able to acquire and the synergistic value of what that's going to bring to automation. To Wamsi's question, that is going to fuel H2 and that's why H2 pipeline is so strong in automation and data around that synergistic value of IBM, Red Hat, and HashiCorp together. So that synergistic play of M&A is going to play out in 2026. Three, the integrated value of that multiplier effect of having a mainframe platform.\nWe have taken up the year on infra on mainframe. We see a very strong start, and that $3 to 4 platform multiplier plays out in 2026 and 2027. Then finally, consulting backlog, $32 billion. Which leads me to your last question, and let me take a little bit of a moment to talk about this because there's been a lot of competitors that have come out already in the marketplace. Our consulting overall revenue was flat. We stabilized coming off of Q4, down 1%. I would tell you we're still operating, as we said in prepared remarks, in a very dynamic environment. Clients are reprioritizing that spending; they're focused on cost efficiency and deploying GenAI to really drive not only the operating leverage in their own business, but, to Arvind's point, leveraging technology for what it's done for a century.\nThat is create scale and create new businesses and new markets and opportunities and we're capitalizing on that. But even with that dynamic environment, I might surprise you right now, but we're actually seeing some good green shoots. One, I would put it in four buckets: backlog, two GenAI, three our strategic partnerships, and four the fundamentals of our business. Regarding that, productivity backlog $32 billion at spot rates, which is what's going to play out over the history of that backlog, up over 8%, stable erosion. And Jim, to your question, our duration is actually down six months from last year, so we're seeing much more higher revenue realization, higher quality overall, and our trailing twelve-month book-to-bill is 1.14. Now our signings in the quarter, before someone else asked the question, we were down 18%. That was entirely driven by last year's large early renewals.\nAs we've talked about over the years, I've been very clear: all signings are not the same. Renewals by definition are low to no revenue realization. They're typically revenue and margin compression, and that's what's playing out here in the H1. Underneath that though, our net new business penetration was up 13% year-to-year. In the H1, up 7 points. We added 200-plus new clients we acquired already in our consulting business year-over-year, and that's fueling actually an accelerated backlog in the H2 on what that backlog run out looks like in the H2.\nBut, again, as you all know, that's only about 70% of the revenue in the H2. We still have to sell and bill new business starting in July through the rest of the year. But encouraging green shoots: GenAI $6 billion plus, by the way, 17% of our backlog now, growing substantially over 20% of our bookings, and for the first time in the Q2, we eclipsed 10% of our revenue now coming out of GenAI, at, by the way, over a three-point margin. Differentiating strategic partnerships, great momentum in SAP, Microsoft, AWS, Palo Alto; by the way, we have a lot of headroom.\nAnd productivity and business model. Our margins are up over 200 basis points through the H1. So while a lot of green shoots, I think to Ben's question, we're prudently cautious in this environment, and by the way, as those green shoots play out in the H2, it's upside to our guide.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. Arvind, I wanted to direct this to you, and it kind of builds off of what Jim was just talking about. It's been, I think, only six quarters. You've reached a $7.5 billion cumulative AI book of business. Incredibly impressive in such a short period of time. And I'm just wondering if you could provide us with color on how that's impacting customer spend in the non AI parts of IBM. And really what I'm trying to understand is how are customers prioritizing AI over non-AI? Is there cannibalization in other areas of client spend or is it incremental to client spend?\nAnd how might that change as you look at these engagements out over the next, call it, one to three years? Does it become more incremental? Just would love some flavor on incrementalism versus cannibalization. Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Eric, for the question. I'm going to sort of maybe dive down to the components of what is called a full AI stack to answer your question. So let's look at it across hardware, which includes semiconductors. Then look at it in the enabling software layers, in software applications, which actually leverage AI to make themselves much better. And then finally into consulting. So if you look at it first from the semiconductors and the infrastructure level, I would tell you that this is completely incremental. And you can see that in the market when you look at CPU vs. GPU, the CPU rates maintain, yes, who they are provided by changes all the time. But the total volume of servers is not decreasing. So that tells you that is maintained what could happen.\nBut I would put that in the very tiny percentages of maybe 1%, 2%, 3% is that people will put a little bit more pricing pressure on the item they believe to be commodity versus the item they believe to be high innovation. But that is just the way technology has always played out. That is where you're seeing it, and you can see that reflected in the market right now. Next, when you get to the enabling software layers, that is purely incremental. There is no cannibalization there with alternate forms of technology. I will tell you that the cannibalization is going to come from the fourth part. People are looking at their own internal labor expenses, and people are looking at their third party labor expenses, and they are looking to decrease those to make room for what they are doing around.\nWhen you look at AI coming into software products, whether it's ours, for example in our case, in Apptio, in HashiCorp, in Turbonomic, so the known direct AI products, it actually makes those products better and compete better against others. So it's not a cannibalization because that would apply to ourselves. That is more a market share question that it takes market share from those who are unable to do that, and you can also see that play out in the market with other players. If I look at consulting, yes, there is a big piece of the AI book of business which is coming because people are directing their dollars towards that kind of consulting as opposed to alternate forms of consulting.\nThat is why it's really important to be focused on what we call transformative projects, which includes AI, but also include some of our partners, be it the cloud partners, or SAP, or Oracle, or Palo Alto Networks, et cetera, because that kind of project is far more robust and less likely to be cannibalized. But some other parts of customer application development do tend to get cannibalized toward AI. So hopefully that gives you some color on both parts of your question where our clients prioritizing and also where it's incremental.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, Arvind, for you. I appreciate your public sector related comments at the beginning of the call, and it seems like we're starting to see a more aggressive competitive stance regarding IT investment from the current administration. I guess based on conversations you may have had, could you frame out how you think IBM is positioned to address the shift in spending priorities of the administration or public sector in general? And how much visibility do you have there? Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah, thanks Brian. Look, I'll use the word federal as opposed to public sector because just because in some of our written documents public includes healthcare, life sciences, and others. So I'll use the word federal and government to, to be more precise in what this is from my conversations direct as well as public statements from various members of the administration. They had a very strong focus in the first six months to focus on cost cutting and efficiency to get to what they believed was the right size. They have been very, very clear. Their focus is now shifting to number one, we need to modernize the agencies in how they leverage technology to provide a better service to citizens and to leverage technology to also reduce waste as opposed to just cost cutting.\nTwo, I was very pleased to see the AI action plan that came out this morning. They are very clear that AI has to be used by government agencies against the goals I just laid out then. While these have not concluded the conversations we've been having with a number of agencies on leveraging our capabilities across both software as well as consulting to help them go on their path towards modernization, towards better services for citizens, towards reducing waste, and towards more effective overall systems kind of coming all the way into the 21st century. I'm actually quite enthused by their ability to begin to make progress in the next few months. So that's kind of what we're observing.\nAnd so the visibility, I would tell you, when they are willing to make time and they're willing to meet at the highest levels in the various agencies, that's a positive statement that they are serious about it and they do take us. And the visibility I get then is that I think we are a credible player because of our track record and having delivered for the government in the past many years.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC. Please state your question.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nDirector of Equity Research, RBC\n\nAll right, yeah, thanks for taking my question, Arvind. I want to double click, I think on the $1.5 billion of software bookings in the GenAI space. Specifically on some of these watsonx products. The data, the governance, and Orchestrate. So I guess one would be, are you starting to see any of these really differentiate themselves in terms of customer demand? Specifically on the Orchestrate layer. That seems to be a space that. A lot of companies have started to. Talk about whether it be model orchestration or agentic orchestration. If you can just talk a little. More about your right to win in. That space and how you're positioned.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, IBM",
    "content2": "Matt, thanks for the question. First, I have been really pleased by both the uptake and the overall adoption of our GenAI products. We put most of them under the watsonx umbrella, so that's kind of where they show up in our internals first. There's a few that you did not mention that I think are very unique to us, both because of the knowledge we have as well as the capabilities that our engineers bring to the table. The watsonx Code Assistant for Z, which helps people modernize their mainframe environment, helps you understand and, if you want, translate your COBOL code into Java, is really taken off and has got very wide adoption.\nWe thought people would use it to just modernize COBOL to Java, but actually in the vast majority of the cases, people are also using it to understand the tens of millions of lines of code that they have and then decide what makes sense to modernize versus what makes sense to keep now that you can document it and know what it does. The second one that is very exciting that we are bringing out in this Q3 is watsonx Code Assistant for Z, which helps you have an AI administrator that manages your mainframe environment in addition to the people you have who manage it. These are, I think, somewhat unique to us. If I think about watsonx AI, people need an AI runtime, whether that's going to come from watsonx AI as a place that they can get the models.\nWe are very focused on domain specific, smaller models as opposed to the very, very large models. That becomes a carrier for those. I think you're going to see a lot more of those under the watsonx AI and OpenShift AI umbrella, because that is where some of those capabilities are going to migrate. People need to get their data ready for AI. That's where watsonx.data plays. We believe with the upcoming integration of the DataStax capabilities into that, that will then become an even stronger offering. The last part of your question, and not to avoid your asking, what gives us the right to win in Orchestrate? Look, IBM has always been about being in a heterogeneous space. It cannot be about just our own agents, of which we have about 70 to 80 of them.\nIt cannot be about bespoke agents only because we believe many of our clients are going to build bespoke agents that are unique to them. We also integrate in about 70 agents from third parties that come in there. This is going to be won based on how easy is it if it is only about your own agent? I actually think that those are our partners, those are not people we compete with. Plenty are going to focus primarily on their own agents. Great. There are going to be agents that come from different places, and people want their own bespoke agents. That is the client where we are going to win and orchestrate. That is what our pipeline and our early discussions with clients show. That is what distinguishes us from those who are kind of focused on primarily their own agents.\nSo. Look, to close the call out, we are off to a great start in the H1. Our portfolio strength, the resilience of our business model, reinforces our confidence in our growth trajectory. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Arvind. Operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Olympia McNerney, IBM's Global Head of Investor Relations. Olympia, you may begin.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Q1 2025 earnings presentation. I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain Non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other Non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our Investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us today. We are off to a strong start in 2025, exceeding our expectations for the quarter, driven by solid revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow generation. While sentiment and the operating environment have been rapidly shifting, our performance reflects the continued success of our focus strategy around hybrid cloud and AI, especially where clients are looking for cost savings, productivity gains, and trusted partners to help them move fast and scale. Those needs remain front and center in today's market. Before going deeper into our results, let me start by saying that we appreciate the administration's focus on economic growth and rational regulation, which will strengthen the US competitive position. We believe this will result in long-term value creation and make it easier for technology to contribute to economic growth.\nI'm going to now talk about our results for the quarter and then address the macro and how we are positioning within these conditions. Our performance this quarter reflects the flywheel for growth we discussed at our Investor Day. It all starts with client trust, with a 100-plus year history of delivering mission-critical solutions and navigating different operating environments. Trust is complemented by the flexible solutions we offer in hybrid cloud and AI, the innovation value we provide, our domain expertise to help clients digitally transform and scale AI, and our partner ecosystem to broaden our reach and impact. We saw these play out in Q1. Our growth was led by software, up 9%, with strength across Red Hat, automation, data, and transaction processing.\nOur early leadership in generative AI and the Consulting Advantage platform, using digital assets to deliver client value, have positioned us well in today's evolving market. In infrastructure, z16 is our most successful program in history, highlighting customer adoption and the value proposition of the mainframe. In generative AI, we continue to see strong traction. Our book of business is now over $6 billion inception to date, up over $1 billion in the quarter. Approximately 1/5 of this book of business comes from software, and the remaining 4/5 is consulting. This is similar to last quarter. The AI portfolio we have built is designed to give clients a comprehensive set of tools to deploy AI within their enterprise. In software, the ability to deploy our AI assistants and agents, as well as AI middleware in a hybrid environment, leveraging multimodal capabilities, is resonating with clients.\nAI agents will accelerate the ability of many enterprises to turn the promise of generative AI into real value. Consulting is helping clients design and deploy AI strategies and use cases. We continue to see our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients bring AI to their data. Our clients will see these solutions at length at our client conference, Think, in early May in Boston. We remain focused on accelerating innovation, speed, and impact. Earlier this month, we announced the upcoming launch of z17, which delivers enhanced AI acceleration through multimodal AI capabilities, new security features to protect data, and tools that leverage AI for improving system usability. z17's value proposition particularly resonated with clients, given significantly lower power requirements, higher capacity growth, and increased performance over z16.\nIn quantum, we are proud to partner with the Basque Government to deploy Europe's first IBM Quantum System 2 in Spain, a milestone in global quantum leadership. M&A remains a key enabler of our strategy. This quarter, we closed the acquisitions of HashiCorp and AST. HashiCorp brings leading automation and security tools that integrate with our hybrid cloud strategy, and we're excited about the synergy opportunities ahead. Let me now touch on the macro environment. Technology remains a key competitive advantage, allowing businesses to drive cost efficiencies, productivity, and preserve their balance sheets. In the near term, uncertainty may cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach. However, the value of hybrid cloud, automation, data sovereignty, and on-premise solutions becomes even more critical in volatile windows. Recent conversations that I've had with clients reflect this view of the current environment. These conversations vary by industry, business, and geography.\nFor example, our containerization and virtualization pipeline continues to grow, with clients focused not only on near-term costs but also longer-term savings driven by our modernization capabilities. There are also areas of our business where volatility acts as a catalyst for demand, driving increased capacity requirements, particularly across our mainframe environments. This played out over the last couple of weeks amongst our financial services clients. However, for clients with a more direct impact from current policy, the slowdown may be more pronounced. Consulting is also more susceptible to discretionary pullbacks and DOGE-related initiatives. While no one is immune to uncertainty, we enter this environment from a position of relative strength and resiliency. Our clients run the world's most essential processes. Our diversity across businesses, geographies, industries, and large enterprise clients positions us well to navigate the current climate.\nWe have an experienced team that is focused on areas we can control around our supply chain, accelerating our productivity initiatives, and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. With this backdrop, let me touch on our outlook. For the last several years, we have been strengthening our portfolio and building on our track record of execution, and our outperformance this quarter was another proof point. While it is still very early in the second quarter, we have not seen a material change in client buying behavior. With the caveat that the macro situation is fluid, based on what we know today, we are maintaining our full-year guidance for accelerating revenue growth to 5% plus and about $13.5 billion of free cash flow.\nOver the longer term, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our model presented at Investor Day for sustainable higher revenue growth and strong free cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to walk through the financials. Jim, over to you.\n\nJames Jim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. In the first quarter, we delivered $14.5 billion in revenue, $3.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, $1.7 billion of operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share of $1.60. We generated $2 billion of free cash flow, our highest first-quarter free cash flow in many years. Our revenue growth, scale, and accelerating productivity drove 240 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and 12% adjusted EBITDA growth. We exceeded our expectations on revenue, profitability, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Our revenue for the quarter was up 2% at constant currency. As we discussed at our Investor Day, our mix shift towards software is driving growth. We saw this play out in the quarter with software up 9%, driven by growth of 15% in automation, 13% in Red Hat, 7% in data, and 2% in transaction processing.\nThis performance reflects demand for our focused portfolio that provides end-to-end hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. Red Hat delivered another strong quarter, driven by bookings growth in the high teens. OpenShift is now at $1.5 billion ARR, growing about 25%. About 6 points of our growth in software was organic, with contribution from our generative AI products like our AI assistants, agents, and watsonx platform. We also benefited from our high-value recurring revenue base, which comprises about 80% of our annual software revenue. Software's annual recurring revenue grew to $21.7 billion, up 11% since last year. Consulting revenue was flat, and a sequential growth improvement quarter to quarter with solid backlog growth of mid-single digit. Strategy and technology revenue declined 1%, and intelligent operations revenue was flat for the quarter.\nWhile we are seeing clients delay decision-making, especially in discretionary projects, which impacted our in-period signings, we had good growth in transformational offerings like hybrid cloud and data, as well as application management and cloud platform engineering services. We also continue to build our consulting generative AI book of business, which is now over $5 billion inception to date. Infrastructure revenue declined 4%. Hybrid infrastructure was down 7%, driven by IBM Z, down 14%, as we wrapped on the 12th and final quarter of the Z16 program, which delivered strong performance in both revenue and capacity. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 4%, with product cycle dynamics impacting power, while storage delivered another quarter of double-digit growth as our latest innovations continue to address the rising data demands of our clients. Now turning to profitability.\nIn the current environment, we are focused on taking action to control things we can to protect supply chain, margin, and free cash flow. IBM has been driving a productivity mindset for many years. In this quarter, margin performance reflects that intentional discipline and our flexibility of our operating model. During the quarter, operating leverage and yield from accelerated productivity initiatives drove expansion of operating gross profit margin of 190 basis points, adjusted EBITDA margin of 240 basis points, and operating pre-tax margin of 50 basis points. Excluding year-over-year divestiture dynamics and net year-to-year workforce rebalancing, operating pre-tax margin was up 180 basis points, ahead of our expectations and well above our model.\nWe delivered very strong segment profit margin expansion in software and consulting of over 370 basis points and 280 basis points, respectively, while infrastructure was down about 150 basis points, reflecting product cycle dynamics and continued investments in innovation. Let me give you some more color on our productivity initiatives. As discussed at our Investor Day, we remain laser-focused on accelerating our productivity initiatives. We are transforming our enterprise operation, leveraging technology and embedding AI across more than 70 workflows, such as HR, IT support, procurement, finance, quote-to-cash, and more. We have built a best-in-class enterprise IT platform, leveraging our own IBM software solutions across hybrid cloud, automation, and AI. We decreased our vendor spend by more than $1 billion by optimizing our supply chain and service delivery, and right-sized our physical infrastructure.\nWe exited 2024 at $3.5 billion of annual run rate savings achieved, and we continue to see these efforts play out in our margin performance this quarter. These actions create a flywheel that allows us to invest back in our business, both organically and inorganically, increase our financial flexibility, and deliver margin expansion. Our ability to toggle these actions up or down, depending on the operating environment, adds significant flexibility to our financial model. The combination of our revenue scale and productivity enabled solid contribution to Free Cash Flow generation. In the quarter, we generated $2 billion of Free Cash Flow, up $100 million year-over-year, resulting in our highest first quarter Free Cash Flow margin in reported history. The largest driver of this growth comes from Adjusted EBITDA, up over $350 million year-over-year.\nPartially offsetting this, given global trade dynamics, we proactively took actions to bolster our supply chain ahead of our Z17 launch, resulting in higher inventory levels. Despite these actions, we are a couple points ahead of our three-year average attainment levels through Q1. Let me briefly address our supply chain dynamics. As Arvind mentioned, IBM has a long track record of operating globally and managing supply chain complexity. Over the last several years, we have strategically diversified and streamlined our supply chain. Goods imported to the US represent less than 5% of our overall spend, and under current US tariff policy, the impact to IBM is minimal. While we have limited direct exposure outside the United States, we are tactically evaluating alternative sources and other strategies to mitigate tariffs. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, solid investment-grade balance sheet, and a disciplined capital allocation policy.\nWe ended the quarter with cash of $17.6 billion, which is up $2.8 billion from the end of 2024, including spending $7.1 billion in acquisitions, driven largely by the closing of HashiCorp. In February, we accessed the debt markets, raising over $8 billion on attractive terms. Our debt balance ending the quarter was over $63 billion, including $10 billion of debt for our financing business, with a receivables portfolio that is over 75% investment grade. In addition, we returned just over $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Now, let me talk about what we see going forward. As everyone knows, there is a level of macro uncertainty that exists and is hard to predict. That said, we are operating from a position of relative strength.\nThe combination of our repositioned and focused portfolio, investment in innovation, and our diversity across businesses, geographies, industries, and large enterprise clients positions us to perform in a variety of macro scenarios. Our flywheel for growth begins with the incumbency and trust we have with clients from decades on the ground in over 175 countries, which is a real point of differentiation in the current environment. Our client base is diverse, operating across almost 20 industries, spanning 95% of the Fortune 500. Based on what we know today, we are maintaining our full-year guidance for accelerating revenue growth of 5%+ and about $13.5 billion of free cash flow. Let me go through the drivers of these key metrics. As discussed at our Investor Day, our mix shift towards software is a key driver of our growth acceleration. Software is now about 45% of our business, with 80% recurring revenue.\nAs a reminder, in Q1, we generated $21.7 billion of ARR, growing 11%. The combination of our portfolio strength, investment in innovation, and contribution from acquisitions to drive our full-year performance in software. We continue to expect mid-teens growth for Red Hat, underpinned by six-month revenue under contract, which is growing in the mid-teens. In consulting, we are encouraged by this quarter's sequential growth in revenue, our solid backlog up 6%, and our book of business in GenAI. But given the current environment, we are appropriately more cautious on consulting's contribution to IBM this year. With our new mainframe launch, innovation across the portfolio, and capacity dynamics that could benefit our mainframe environments and storage needs, we expect infrastructure to grow.\nWhile we feel good about the core growth drivers of our business, there are areas of our portfolio that could see greater variability in the event that the macroeconomic environment deteriorates. This includes consulting, which is more sensitive to discretionary pullbacks, and DOGE-related initiatives, consumption-based services, and software, including in Red Hat, and areas of distributed infrastructure. We continue to expect IBM's full-year operating pre-tax margin to expand by over a half a point, driven by productivity initiatives, revenue scale, and mix, mitigated by the impact of dilution from acquisitions. Our tax rate expectation for the year remains in the mid-teens. As always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For free cash flow, we expect to generate about $13.5 billion in 2025, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nThe headwinds I discussed last quarter of higher cash taxes and higher CapEx remain the same. As I mentioned earlier, we have been accelerating our productivity initiatives to plan for various scenarios and to protect our profitability and Free Cash Flow. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we will remain disciplined about managing our costs. The strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position allow us to make investments in our business for the longer term. As Arvind mentioned, while still early, through the first three weeks of Q2, we have not seen any material change in client buying behaviors. We expect revenue growth of at least 4% at constant currency. Given the increased currency volatility, a revenue range of $16.4 billion to 16.75 billion.\nSecond quarter operating pre-tax margin expansion should be consistent with the full year, with our tax rate in the mid to high teens. Let me conclude by saying that we have a durable and differentiated business model that positions us well to navigate a range of economic environments. While there is uncertainty, we remain laser-focused on taking actions to control what we can and executing our strategy to accelerate revenue growth and free cash flow. We believe our focused portfolio, disciplined investments in innovation, diverse set of businesses and clients, relentless focus on productivity, and strong liquidity drive the durability of our performance. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation.\nAnd then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And at this time, we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we could maybe start off with sort of framing the macro impact that you're seeing on both software and consulting.\nYou talked about some of the potential drivers, but I'm sort of curious at this point. Are you seeing any kind of significant softening in, say, the consumption portion of the portfolio, either Red Hat or otherwise? And do you see any slowdown in specifically transaction processing for the year that would allow you to not sort of hit the target that you laid out at the Investor Day? Similarly, on consulting, are you seeing the DOGE impact sort of significantly impacting the near-term results, or is this more of an expectation of a slowdown in a broader sort of enterprise mix of business? And then just broadly speaking, if you could address the sort of subsegment guidance you had provided at Investor Day approaching double digits in software and low single digits in consulting, and whether we'd expect either of those to change very much. Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nOkay.\nJim, I'm hoping I can remember. I think it was five parts to your question. Let me address the macro pieces, and then I'm going to ask Jim Kavanaugh to address the last piece on the subsegment guidance. So if we look at what happened in Q1, and then if you project forward, there's a difference. We did not really see much of a slowdown in Q1 on the consumption parts of the software business, whether it's in TPS or whether it's in Red Hat, just to be straightforward. We are projecting, though, that if there is a slowdown in global GDP, there could be a small slowdown, not a big slowdown, in the Red Hat part of the consumption business, which, just to remind you, is only between 10% and 20% of the total business.\nIf I look at transaction processing, if anything, we see tailwinds right now, not headwinds. So we expect that part of the portfolio to remain strong unless we approach a recession or negative GDP, which we are not projecting from everything that we can see and read. Going to consulting and DOGE, yes, we are not immune from all those activities, just like everybody else. We had a couple of contracts that were impacted in Q1. You would expect USAID, where we did some work, was impacted, but not really in most other cases. The work we tend to do is much more mission-critical, is much more about building the government systems, which makes them more efficient, and so we see them carry on.\nNow, it's hard to predict where that goes over the rest of the year, so I'm not going to try and make that prediction on DOGE and consulting, except to caution, as Jim said in his prepared remarks, if there is pressure in the economy, consulting tends to see headwinds before other parts of the business. I think there were three or four of your five parts and subsegment compared to Investor Day. Jim, I'll leave it to you.\n\nJames Jim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nAll right. Thanks, Jim, for the question overall. If you go back to Investor Day, what did we talk about? We talked about the strategic repositioning of our portfolio and our company overall to a much more software-centric, platform-centric model. We laid out a financial investment thesis.\nWe called it our shareholder value creation thesis that said we would take this business from a no-growth profile to the last three years, kind of low single-digit profile, to an accelerating revenue growth profile of mid-single-digit plus. And that's how we guided 2025. Underpinning that was an accelerating revenue growth profile of software. And right now, when you look at us maintaining our guidance in 2025, we are right on path to that. And I'm sure we could talk about the underpinnings of software a little bit later. Second, what was a big change we made? We said with the new innovation investments and the repositioning of infrastructure that we were moving that business from a cyclical business to a secular grower.\nIn our guidance for 2025 of the 5+% , we are the first instantiation in 2025 of a secular grower, as we're very excited about the new innovation of our mainframe that was just launched here in the beginning of April. Then we said consulting, over time, the market, which we have confidence in, that's been growing on average 5, 6% over a decade-long. Yeah, are there some years up and down? Absolutely. But we have confidence in a long-term growth factor of consulting and, more importantly, the integrated value of what consulting brings to our portfolio, the tip of the spear, driving and pulling our technology and driving that attractive economic multiplier effect. So you look at 2025, we started the year out this year and we said, given the demand environment, we were prudently cautious at the low end of low single digits.\nWe started out Q1 here, we stabilized the business flat. We see that pretty much the same. There's a lot of dynamics going on in the year, but we're kind of confident in that stat, flat, stabilized area overall. So hopefully it gives you some perspective.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take the next question.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThe next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question. Yes, thank you so much. Maybe just to follow on in terms of just the way to get to your 5%+ guide for the full year, it'd be helpful if maybe it'd be helpful if you could maybe just give us some sense both on Red Hat, which is going to face tougher comps, and transaction processing, which is starting off at 2%, how we get to sort of this double-digit software or approaching double-digit software contribution.\nJim, you noted maybe it's prudent to be a little more cautious on the contribution from consulting. Is that largely going to be offset maybe by better expectations on infrastructure as well? Thank you so much.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, thanks, Wamsi. I'll take this. Let's take a step back. You go through what we talked about in January, and then we played out to Jim's question around our strategic investment thesis for a long-term perspective, which aligned overall about how we accelerate this company and leverage all the work we've done on building a durable, sustainable, inflecting higher growth business. We talked entering the year. One, we were coming into the year with a position of strength that was centered around our software portfolio, our high-value recurring revenue, and our investment in innovation. Two, Red Hat momentum. The opportunity in front of us on virtualization, AI, was going to grow mid-teens.\nThree, our next-generation mainframe that was coming out late in the first half that would fuel second half. Four, our early leadership position in GenAI. And five, our disciplined capital investment allocation and what we've seen with regards to M&A growth and synergies. I would tell you right now, coming out of first quarter, I'm actually feeling more confident on each one of those five. And let me put some numbers to it. We just exited it as a strong 2% growth here in the first quarter. We maintained our full year at 5-plus%. How do you get there? Well, embedded in that 2%, we got about four points of contribution from software. We had a one-point headwind given we were at the last 12-quarter cycle of our infrastructure business, and consulting stabilized was flat. Looking forward.\nNumber one, that new innovation in our infrastructure turns a point headwind in Q2 to a point tailwind for the full year. That's a full two-point change. So you go from 2% already to 4%. Number two, we are very excited. We closed HashiCorp at the end of February. Our actual contribution around inorganic in the first quarter, give or take, was about a point and a half. To IBM for the full year of 2025, it's going to be north of two and a half. We get another point of M&A. So now you're up to 5% growth. Now you get to, okay, how do we get north of that 5% growth, which is what our guide is? Three, Red Hat, seventh consecutive quarter of high teens ACV bookings. We are seeing great demand around virtualization, around automation, around our Linux capability.\nBy the way, all three grew double digits here in the quarter, pervasive and grew share. Our acceleration in Red Hat coming off of roughly 13.5% in the first quarter, we're going to commit and we maintain mid-teens for the year. We get another half a point out of Red Hat. I haven't even went to our annuity profile, which is in a strong position with strong renewal rates, etc. We'll see how the consulting backlog plays out. But I think to your question, we are being very prudent on cautiously prudent on consulting and not expecting any contribution. So that's kind of a walk from a first quarter to full year.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks a lot. I guess I was hoping you'd talk a bit more on the consulting side.\nYou've talked about there's a lot of noise happening on consulting, especially from the federal and DOGE exposure. So I'd love to understand how big is the federal business for you folks, and how do you think about the discretionary part of your consulting business stacking up in the back half of the year, given some of the macro noise? Just anything on the consulting side would be really helpful. And then, Jim, if I could just follow up, you folks normally don't give a quarterly explicit revenue guide. You're doing it this time around for June quarter. So I'm just curious, what led to the decision to give a more explicit June quarter guide other than you were afraid we were all going to mismodel it?\n\nJames Jim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah. First of all, thanks, Amit.\nLet me take the second question first, and then I'll go into the DOGE specifics to ground us in numbers. Then if Arvind has any of the client pieces back, as we've been actively engaged with the administration, as you can quite imagine. But let's take a look at currency in particular and given a quarterly guide. Why did we do that? Full transparency, we feel obligated with our credibility on what we see in the near term, given we're operating, as we talked about, in a very dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Our best visibility right now is probably in the next 90 days. And given that credibility and transparency to investors, and also in light of the significant US dollar devaluation that's happened over the last three weeks, let's put that in perspective.\nThe rate, the magnitude, and the breadth of the US dollar depreciation we have not seen in quite some time, like 8% to 9% devaluation. So what did we do? We gave you both. We always guide on constant currency, and we guided on constant currency. We could talk about the underpinnings a little bit later. Second, just given the extreme volatility in the market, we guided on an absolute dollar range all in. Why did we do that? Because at 4% constant currency growth, if you just dial back to where the FX rates were as we entered 1 April, that would put you at $16.4 billion. If you actually take that same 4% and you look at today's actually today's spot rate devalued or actually appreciated about a point, so we already gave a point back.\nBut if you look at it from yesterday, we'd be at $16.75 billion. So we're not in the business of predicting the FX volatility. We're giving you a range, but we're saying, as always, what we can control, which is the underlying dynamics of the operational performance of our business, we feel confident of at least 4%. So hopefully that gives you that on DOGE. Let me ground some data and facts here. One, as Arvind said, no one's going to be immune from this. But our US federal business is less than 5% of IBM's total annual revenue. About 60% of that is consulting, which is more susceptible to discretionary efficiency-type programs. 40% of it is technology, which is all high-value annuitized revenue under contract. Let's put that off to the side. In consulting, our US federal is less than 10% of the total.\nBy the way, we have less than 3% market share overall. Now, when you look at it, Arvind indicated, and by the way, all this data is public. We've had a handful of contracts, either statement of work that have or canceled. And on our annualized backlog of over $30 billion in total consulting, this is like less than $100 million of backlog over a duration of multiple years. So while no one's immune, we are absolutely focused on monitoring the dynamic process. And I think back to Wamsi's question, we're prudently cautious around consulting for the year.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nSo, Jim, I think the best thing for you to understand, Amit, federal consulting is less than 10% of consulting. I think that's statement number one. Within that, the vast majority is critical work. We actually process veterans' benefit claims. We help process how the GSA does procurement.\nWe help implement payroll systems. I don't think of these as optional. Now, are there some areas around the edges which could be viewed as discretionary? Yes. But in our case, that is the minority of our business, not the majority.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question. Ben Reitzes, your line is open. Please unmute yourself.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nYeah, thanks. Sorry about that. If you can hear me now, I wanted to talk about the Red Hat business. It decelerated, I guess, 300 basis points sequentially. And I was wondering if we could just talk a little bit more about the dynamics, why that occurred. I think you said the consumption business didn't get hit. And then it looks like it's going to re-accelerate because of the great bookings. And then you mentioned virtualization.\nI don't know if you've mentioned that before in the conference calls, but wondering how much of a driver that is for Red Hat, given some of the changes going on at VMware. So thanks a lot for that.\n\nJames Jim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Ben. Let me take some of the numbers around Red Hat, and then Arvind can add some of the color around the portfolio, etc. I would tell you we're very pleased with our Red Hat performance entering the year. Very different profile than where we were a year ago, by the way, when we were trying to accelerate to get the double digits for the year. Yes, it decelerated, but let me unpack some of this for you. One, we grew 13.5%. I think well within our guidance range of where we wanted to start the year.\nUnderpinning that, the most important thing, as you called out, Ben, thank you, our seventh consecutive quarter of strong ACV signings bookings, high teens overall. The way I like to look at this business, you've got to break it out between the different compositions. One, 80% of our portfolio is subscription-based businesses. We continue to see strong performance, high mid-teens level overall. Pervasive double-digit growth across the portfolio, as I stated earlier, in gaining share. Rell up 13%. Red Hat OpenShift up 23%. Oh, by the way, $1.5 billion ARR business overall, capitalizing on virtualization, hybrid cloud application modernization. Ansible up strong mid-teens overall, capitalizing on clients, cost efficiency, productivity agenda. And oh, by the way, very strong synergistic value of the IBM portfolio overall. So a very healthy profile. And within that, as we always do, we give you a CRPO next six months.\nWe only see that actually accelerating overall. Now, to Arvind's earlier point, the 20% of the business on consumption-based, we did not see a decline. We saw a moderation. Remember, 90 days ago, we actually were surprised to the upside. We grew our consumption-based services, low mid-teens. In Q1, that moderated to high single digits. By the way, our model can take high single digits. It's just when you look at the quarter-to-quarter growth, that had about a point and a half plus deceleration overall. But growing high single digits on consumption, given the acceleration of our Red Hat portfolio overall, we feel pretty good. And to your point, excited about the portfolio and growth process around the growth factor of virtualization, around AI, around automation, around containerization, and the moderations happening there.\nJust to put some numbers to it, virtualization already, just the last couple of quarters, we've already notched in over $200 million of annualized bookings. We've been building a pipeline that is well north of $500 million worth of virtualization. That gives us the confidence as we go through the remainder of 2025 and why we feel confident in guiding mid-teens.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah, so thanks, Jim. Let me just add a little bit of color on the portfolio. OpenShift has become the leading platform, which clients were using for both containerization, but also how you run a collection of servers on-premise and in private clouds. Now, as they look forward, it's not just containerization.\nThey're saying, If I'm doing containerization, why wouldn't I also do virtualization on that environment? Since that set of products is sold by the number of cores or processes managed, then as they add virtualization, that adds to the footprint. Now, of course, as we all know, once they make a platform decision, then most new applications, most migrated applications tend to come onto that infrastructure. Their skills around that platform grow, and you get a flywheel that over time will then, we believe, include both HashiCorp and Ansible that will come in there. That is the way I think you should think about virtualization, not so much as vis-à-vis competitors only. It's going to be much more about a platform, and people are making a decision, Which platform can I depend upon for the next 10 to 20 years?\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nEquity Research Executive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Jim, I just wanted to dig into your free cash flow guide. You reiterated the full-year revenue guide and constant currency, but FX just went from a two-point headwind to a one and a quarter point tailwind. So an incremental, call it 2 billion of rev from FX alone, you maintained your full-year PTI margin expansion target. So obviously, really strong flow through to the bottom line. And so I guess my question is, why aren't we seeing that necessarily show up in a higher free cash flow guide for the year? Are we just being conservative because it's early in the year, or are there any new kind of incremental free cash flow offsets that we now need to think about? Thanks so much.\n\nJames Jim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYes, thanks, Eric. I really appreciate the question. As we talk about, we've got two key measures in this company. One is to continue to accelerate the top-line growth profile of this company, which we committed to 5%+. And second is that Free Cash Flow generation engine. We're very pleased about the start to the first quarter, $2 billion Free Cash Flow print, highest Free Cash Flow margin in a first quarter in the history of our company overall. And by the way, historically, compared to where we're at attainment-wise, we're a few points ahead. Now, to your point, we're 15% of our Free Cash Flow attained through first quarter. I think it's prudent for us right now. We feel even stronger about our position around the $13.5 billion. But why take that up right now in this environment? Doesn't benefit us at all.\nWe're focused on the durability, resiliency, and driving the discipline execution overall. Now, with regards to currency overall, as you know, we spent a lot of time both through the last recession of COVID about when we see fundamental unprecedented rate magnitude and breadth changes in currency. It's always good to refresh our investors about how we handle currency. Number one, per GAAP, you can't hedge revenue. That revenue is going to flow whether the dollar is appreciating or devaluing. But I think a couple of important points overall. We have a very robust hedging program. But around that, we hedge only cash flows as a proxy for earnings. That's all you can do. We don't hedge all 100-plus currencies we operate in today. We only hedge about 30 because it's not economically viable to hedge more than 30.\nSo when you take a look at it today, we don't also hedge out more than 12 months because we don't speculate. So when you look at it, the interesting thing is we have to overcome an operating pre-tax margin headwind when the dollar actually devalues because we have to wrap around on the hedges from last year. Right? You'll get absolute profit dollars, yes, but it's mitigated because we try to hedge as much as we can in quarter. We're at about 100%. In outer quarters, we hedge about 75%. So around that, do we have some tailwinds on free cash flow? Absolutely. But the biggest driver of our free cash flow continues to be the same thing we talked about 90 days ago.\nThe driver of high-quality Adjusted EBITDA, which, by the way, we grew 12% in Q1, up 240 basis points of margin and Adjusted EBITDA in Q1. Our Free Cash Flow is going to be driven by double-digit EBITDA for the year, and it's going to be driven by a 100-plus basis point margin overall. That hasn't changed. So nothing changed overall. I would say net more conservative, but prudently given we have 85% of our Free Cash Flow to go.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question.\nArvind, I know it's super early here with regard to the mainframe cycle, but given the experience that you have with previous cycles, what do you anticipate from a macro perspective for an impact on the mainframe cycle? And would you consider taking on more balance sheet risk, maybe to ease the pain of any customer CapEx for that business this year?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nOkay. Brian, thanks for the question. Actually, the last part of the question, Jim can add more, but it's actually pretty straightforward. We've been happy to lease our own hardware and software where a client wants it for decades. And so if they don't want to spend the CapEx, if they prefer to lease it, that is in our financing business. It's in the model.\nAnd it is surprising on how many people, even those with great balance sheets of their own, often choose to do that in order to maximize it. It doesn't really impact our balance sheet because in that case, we have a receivable against the debt that we take on to do that. So we would happily do that for any credit-worthy client. Let me just put that one caveat. That's it. And that is across all countries that we operate in. We don't do this only in the United States. Okay. The other part of your question, as you can imagine, we start testing very early with our clients, a good six to nine months in sort of more private, confidential gatherings on what their reaction is going to be.\nGiven what we showed them around security, around AI, and around increased capacity, almost all of them resonated very positively to the mainframe. The ones I would expect to be early have already come and said to me that, \"Yes, we are extremely interested.\" So I actually expect the volatility plays in our favor because those who are thinking about capacity expansion in the end of the year are wondering whether it's more advantageous to them to do it earlier because there is a financial benefit if you have it as opposed to pay for overages, which is certainly possible. I expect that through this year, 2025, and H1 2026, it will be a very strong cycle.\nIf we see any weakness at all compared to the previous cycle, just one-to-one, maybe it'll be in late 2026 or early 2027, where some clients in smaller geographies, smaller countries, may choose to say, \"Should I wait another six months or nine months?\" I don't expect that. Let me be clear. But I think that is the only caution I would put. So in the first year, I expect this to be very much like the previous cycle.\n\nJames Jim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah. And Brian, on your question on the balance sheet and capital structure, let me take it up a level.\nYes, mainframe is an integral part of our business portfolio overall, and it is an enduring platform that we are going to ensure that we prudently but aggressively manage both the client value equation, which is very important because remember, we run 45 of the top 50 banks around the world, nine of the top 10 retailers, four to five top 10 airlines of the world. We are going to protect those clients and what the mainframe brings to the table. But I want to take a step back. We are confident in our capital structure overall and our liquidity position. And I think over the last four or five years, hopefully all our investors agree, we have a proven track record around being disciplined allocators of capital. We take that very seriously in this company overall.\nIn times of uncertainty around dynamic macro environment, which is what we're operating in today in a very fluid environment, I would tell you as a CFO, as I tell Arvind all the time, our job is to preserve the balance sheet, is to make sure we have enough liquidity. Why? Because we have to continuously invest in bringing new innovation, both organically and inorganically, to this business to create long-term sustainable competitive advantage. I would tell you we are very comfortable. We have over $17.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We got a free cash flow engine we just talked about. What Erik's question, we feel very confident in $13.5 billion of free cash flow. We got the capital structure and a solid investment grade that gives us optionality to ensure we continue that durability and resiliency of our performance going forward.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Thank you guys so much for taking my questions. Arvind, across 2024, every time we had new GenAI product announcements, it was always really centered on this ROI-focused approach, and that was in a much better macro. Now we're in a more challenging macro. I'm just interested, are you seeing in any spaces, whether it be through the consulting arm or just more customer interest in this ROI-driven approach, whether it be to hybrid or to GenAI? And does that make your product set a bit more defensive?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nSo Matt, thanks for that question. If you don't mind, I'm going to go up a few feet and then come back to answer your question explicitly. Every time there's a new technology, you kind of see three waves.\nThe first wave typically lasts one, two, or three years, which is around the semiconductors that enable that new wave. Think PC and the microprocessor was, think mobile phone and the hardware was. You then switch to the system. So pretty quickly, if I think about the PC, people stop caring about the microprocessor. Yes, it was Intel as the winner, but they cared about a Compaq, a Dell, an HP, or take your favorite pick of PC. You go to the system. That kind of lasts a year or two. And then you get a long tail of 20 years where people worry about the application because that is what gives them value. I think we're exactly at that point in AI.\nSo the client conversations have shifted from, \"Well, which GPU, which cloud, which model?\" I think of that all as the lower two layers too. Is this going to improve customer experience? Is this going to improve enterprise operations? And I'll reflect on one yesterday from a mid-size client. They're a $4 to $5 billion client. They're not a massive so-called mid-size. And their question was, \"If we believe that we can get 30% savings in our back-office finance process,\" and they meant procurement, payments, and receivables, we're all in. So I think it is right at this moment it is shifting to those conversations. And I believe that that is where the next two to three years of success in AI is going to go.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay. Operator, let's take one last question.\nThank you. And this question comes from Param Singh with Oppenheimer & Company. Please state your question.\nParam Singh, your line is open. Please unmute yourself. Param Singh, your line is open. Please unmute yourself. No response from that caller.\nI think we can end. Let me turn it back to Arvind to close.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you, Olympia. Look, as I mentioned earlier, the diversity across our business positions us well to navigate the current climate. Our portfolio and track record of execution reinforce my confidence on this next chapter of our growth. I look forward to sharing our progress as we move through the rest of the year. Thank you all for listening.",

Olympia, you may begin.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation. I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us today. Let me start by reflecting on our strong close to 2024 and performance over the midterm model, then get into more detail on the execution of our strategy. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2024, delivering revenue growth of 3% and $12.7 billion of free cash flow. We saw continued acceleration in software and our highest level of cash flow generation in many years. As we close out the midterm model we laid out at the end of 2021, I am proud of our achievements. We met or exceeded our target metrics for revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow growth. We set out a plan for mid-single-digit growth, and we delivered on it, growing our revenue by a 6% CAGR over this period. All of our segments delivered revenue growth in line with our model over the last three years.\nSoftware grew ahead of our goal of mid-single digits, and this momentum continued with 9% growth in 2024. We committed to accelerate the growth of Red Hat, and we delivered double digits for the year. Infrastructure performed in line with our model as we invested in innovation and transformed the business model. Consulting met the model for high single-digit growth, although we acknowledge 2024 was below model. We are confident that our investment in partnerships and skills, as well as our early leadership in GenAI, position us to accelerate consulting growth as we move forward. Overall, our technology momentum and consulting signings bolster our confidence in our future performance. Before getting deeper into our execution, I'll make a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. As we look at the broader environment, IBM's mission to help businesses leverage technology to both scale revenue and grow profitably is more critical than ever.\nGeopolitical tensions, interest rate volatility, supply chain vulnerabilities, demographic shifts, evolving cyber threats are creating headwinds for businesses worldwide. In this context, technology is key to drive sustainable growth. IBM's combination of advanced technology and deep consulting expertise positions us to uniquely deliver end-to-end business transformations. We entered the year intent on enhancing our portfolio. Software is now about 45% of our business, with more than $15 billion of ARR growing at double digits. We delivered strong and accelerating revenue growth of 11% in the fourth quarter, which includes 8 points of organic growth and strength across the portfolio. This growth was led by Red Hat, up 17% in the quarter. Our early leadership in generative AI and the Consulting Advantage platform have positioned us well in today's evolving market. In infrastructure, Z16 is our most successful program in history, highlighting customer adoption and continued reliance on the mainframe.\nWe see more opportunities ahead as our infrastructure solutions play a crucial role in helping clients bring AI workloads closer to their data, and we will launch Z17 in the middle of 2025. Let me now address our progress in generative AI. We continue to gain momentum, with our GenAI book of business growing to over $5 billion inception to date, up by about $2 billion quarter over quarter. Approximately 1/5 of this book of business comes from software, and the remaining 4/5 is consulting. Our AI portfolio is tailored to meet the diverse needs of enterprise clients, enabling them to leverage a mix of models: IBM's, their own, open models from Hugging Face, Meta, and Mistral. IBM's Granite models, designed for specific purposes, are 90% more cost-efficient than larger alternatives. Additionally, RHEL AI and OpenShift AI provide clients with a consistent and scalable AI foundation built on open-source technology.\nThis quarter, we saw strong traction in our What's Next middleware solutions and AI assistants, including What's the Next.gov, What's the Next.ai, What's the Next code assistant for Z, What's the Next Orchestrate, as well as products embedding AI such as Concert. Consulting remains key to designing and implementing AI use cases, driving What's the Next deployment. Through the year, we introduced key innovations that are resonating with clients. This quarter, we launched OpenShift Virtualization to meet growing virtualization demand. In infrastructure, the Telum II processor enhances IBM Z's AI capabilities and performance. We just announced RISE with SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server, offering the fastest and easiest migration from on-premises to cloud for the 10,000-plus clients who use SAP on IBM Power. The Consulting Advantage platform is integrating our technology and industry expertise to drive business transformation.\nWith more than 75 quantum systems deployed worldwide, our focus on emerging innovation is clear. This quarter, we announced a collaboration with the State of Illinois to establish the National Quantum Algorithm Center in Chicago. M&A remains a key enabler of our strategy. The acquisition of Neural Magic strengthens our AI solutions with advanced model optimization. Clients worldwide trust IBM to lead transformations. Notable examples this quarter include NatWest and Lockheed Martin, leveraging our Granite models for advanced AI applications. L'Oréal is partnering with IBM to use our AI consulting and research capabilities to develop foundation models for cosmetic formulation. We also collaborated with UFC and Ferrari, helping them tap into IBM's AI and consulting expertise to drive operational efficiency. Announced earlier this month, IBM and the UK Home Office will partner on the emergency services network, supporting more than 300,000 emergency responders in Great Britain.\nOur ecosystem continues to expand as we strengthen our partnerships with leading technology providers, including AMD, Palo Alto Networks, SAP, Amazon, Microsoft, and CoreWeave. These partnerships allow us to co-innovate and deliver greater value to clients. Before I conclude, let me touch on our outlook. We see continued momentum in our business, driven by our focused strategy, enhanced portfolio, and culture of innovation. For 2025, we expect revenue growth inflecting higher to 5% plus and about $13.5 billion of free cash flow. I look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Investor Day on 4 February 2025. I will now hand over to Jim to walk you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. For the full year, we delivered about $63 billion in revenue, $11.2 billion of operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share of $10.33. We generated $12.7 billion of free cash flow, our strongest level of free cash flow generation in many years, and our highest reported free cash flow margin in history. Revenue growth, combined with 120 basis points of operating pre-tax margin expansion, drove 9% operating pre-tax profit growth, 14% free cash flow growth, and 7% operating diluted earnings per share growth. We are pleased with these results, delivering durable revenue growth in our repositioned business and exceeding our expectations on profitability, free cash flow, and earnings per share. Revenue performance for the year was led by software, up 9%, with strength across our portfolio. We achieved Rule of 40, driven by the combination of accelerating growth and margin expansion throughout the year.\nConsulting revenue was up 1% and continued to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritized spending. While infrastructure was down 3%, reflecting product cycle dynamics, we delivered more than 120% program-to-program growth for Z16, our most successful program in history. Our portfolio mix, operating leverage, and yield from productivity initiatives generated strong operating gross margin and operating profit performance. For the full year, we expanded operating gross profit margin by 130 basis points. Our operating pre-tax margin expanded by 120 basis points, ahead of our expectations and well above our model. These results represent our highest level of operating gross margin and operating pre-tax margin in many years. Now, turning to a deeper dive on the quarter, we generated $17.6 billion of revenue, up over 2% at constant currency and ahead of our expectation.\nSoftware growth accelerated to 11%, with strength across our key categories of Red Hat, automation, data and AI, and transaction processing. Consulting was down 1%. This quarter, we achieved record levels of signings and strong sequential growth in our generative AI book of business, reflecting our early leadership in the areas our clients are prioritizing. Infrastructure was down 6%, reflecting product cycle dynamics in our 11th quarter of Z16. Looking at our profit metrics, in the fourth quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 50 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 40 basis points. We are pleased with this strong performance, driven by our portfolio mix, operating leverage, and ongoing productivity initiatives, similar to the full year. This allowed for continued investments to drive innovation in our portfolio, which you can see in our higher R&D expense, up 13%.\nOur operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year, and our operating earnings per share of $3.92 was up 1%. For the full year, we generated $12.7 billion of free cash flow, up $1.5 billion and growing 14%. The largest driver of this growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $900 million year over year. We realized $500 million in proceeds from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, which was a small contribution to free cash flow, given the payout of structural actions and foregone profit. We also delivered sustainable lower cash requirements through changes in our retirement plans.\nAs we close out the midterm model we introduced in 2021, we've grown free cash flow faster than revenue in each of the last three years, have exited 2024 with our highest free cash flow margin in reported history, and our free cash flow run rate is above our midterm model. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested over $3 billion on acquisitions, and we returned just over $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with a strong liquidity position with cash of $14.8 billion, which is up $1.3 billion year over year. Our debt balance ended the year down $1.6 billion at $55 billion, including approximately $12 billion of debt associated with our financing business.\nTurning to the segments, software revenue growth accelerated to 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by strength across the portfolio, with growth of 17% for Red Hat, 16% for automation, 11% for transaction processing, and 5% for both data and AI, and security. We are pleased with how we finished the year, exceeding the Rule of 40 and the growth driver expectations we set back in January. Let me dive in a little deeper on each of these growth drivers. We continue to see momentum in Red Hat, with fourth quarter revenue growth of 17%, fueled by six consecutive quarters of double-digit bookings growth. This performance reflects the continued demand for our hybrid cloud solutions as clients are prioritizing application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spend and reduce operational complexity.\nOpenShift is now $1.4 billion ARR business, growing about 25%, and we continue to see increased volume in OpenShift virtualization engagements. In addition to the strength in subscriptions, we saw a recovery in the consumption-based services business. Looking forward, Red Hat's six-month revenue under contract, a reflection of the strong bookings performance mentioned, continues to grow in the mid-teens. We delivered strong results in our recurring revenue base and are seeing momentum from innovation across our portfolio. Our hybrid platform and solutions ARR was $15.3 billion, up 11%. Transaction processing delivered another strong quarter, driven by growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates, and increasing contribution from our generative AI product, What's Next code assistant for Z. We continue to introduce new products, which are making a meaningful impact on software's results. We have confidence in our portfolio with our market-leading businesses centered around hybrid cloud, automation, data, and transaction processing.\nIn the quarter, about eight points of our growth was organic, led by demand for our generative AI products like Concert and our AI assistants. We launched new products such as next generation of watsonx Code Assistant that provides coding support for multiple languages and Guardian Quantum Safe that helps organizations monitor and manage their cryptographic security to fix vulnerabilities. These investments in generative AI are paying off, with the software AI book of business reaching about $1 billion inception to date in the fourth quarter. Our performance continues to benefit from our recent acquisitions. We are seeing growing contribution from the StreamSets and webMethods assets acquired in the second quarter. At the end of 2024, we closed the acquisition of Neural Magic, which strengthens our AI capabilities in performance engineering and model optimization.\nWe are looking forward to the opportunities that the pending HashiCorp acquisition will bring. Looking at software profit for the quarter, gross margin expanded and segment profit was up over 220 basis points year to year, reflecting operating leverage driven by our revenue performance. In consulting, revenue was down 1%. Throughout the year, we have operated in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to see clients reprioritizing their IT spending towards digital transformation and AI initiatives for cost optimization and operational efficiency as we wrap up a strong above-market performance in 2023. Our focus remains on rapidly evolving our offerings and enhancing investments in skills and capabilities to align with these priorities. Our ability to address client demands drove signings growth of 23% in the quarter, our highest fourth quarter signings in recent history.\nGenerative AI contributed about $1.5 billion of new bookings in the quarter as clients see the value our extensive industry and enterprise AI expertise can bring to accelerating their digital transformations. The strong signings performance takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.21 over the last 12 months. Our overall backlog remains healthy, up 8% year over year, and our backlog erosion levels remain stable. Our Red Hat practice delivered another record-breaking quarter of signings and double-digit revenue growth, and we now have an annual revenue of nearly $3 billion. In the quarter, strategic partnerships were a growth contributor, both in signings and revenue, with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. We are actively investing to enhance our skills and capabilities to address our clients' top priorities with acquisitions like Accelalpha, a global Oracle services provider, which closed in the fourth quarter.\nEarlier this month, we announced our intent to acquire Applications Software Technology, a consultancy known for driving business transformation with Oracle Cloud applications. Turning to our lines of business, business transformation revenue grew 2%, driven by continued strength in transformational projects for data, finance, and supply chain. Both technology consulting and application operations declined in the quarter. Similar to last quarter, there was strength in cloud-based application services across modernization, development, and management. But we continue to see clients reprioritize spending away from on-prem customized services. Looking at consulting profit, we delivered segment profit margin of nearly 12%, a sequential expansion of almost one point as we continue to realize the benefits of our productivity actions. Moving to the infrastructure segment, revenue was down 6%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Hybrid infrastructure was down 8%, and infrastructure support was flat.\nWithin hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z revenue is down 20% in the quarter. This is the 11th quarter of Z16 availability, and the combination of resiliency, reliability, and security continues to resonate with clients. Nearly three years in, this product cycle has outpaced prior cycles, and program-to-date installed MIPS have increased over 30% as clients' capacity needs continue to grow. IBM Z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving not just hardware adoption but also the related software, storage, and services. Distributed infrastructure revenue grew 2%. This performance was fueled by double-digit growth in storage as we introduced new innovation in quarter designed to give clients the ability to scale storage capacity to meet growing data demands to support the next generation of AI workloads and projects. For infrastructure profit, we expanded gross profit margin nearly two points sequentially.\nOur segment profit margin was down 320 basis points in the quarter, reflecting where we are in the product cycle and continued investments in innovation. For the full year, our segment profit margin was 17.5%. Now, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. As Arvind mentioned, we met or exceeded our midterm model target metrics for revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow growth, and we have fundamentally repositioned our business to a software-led integrated platform. Let me now turn to 2025 guidance on our two key measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. We expect constant currency revenue growth inflecting higher to 5% plus, and we expect to grow free cash flow faster than revenue growth with about $13.5 billion of free cash flow.\nGiven the continued strengthening of the dollar, we expect currency to be about a two-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. Our revenue expectations are underpinned by accelerating growth across our businesses. In software, given the strength of our portfolio, investment in innovation, and the contribution from acquisitions, we expect revenue growth approaching double digits. We continue to see the strength in Red Hat with mid-teens growth for the year. In consulting, the combination of our backlog levels, record signings in the fourth quarter, and our book of business in GenAI support an acceleration in growth to low single digits. With our new mainframe launch in mid-2025, we expect infrastructure to be about a point contribution to IBM's overall revenue growth. For the full year, we expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by over half a point.\nPortfolio mix and ongoing productivity initiatives continue to drive margin expansion, mitigated by the impact of dilution from acquisitions. Our tax rate for the year should be in the mid-teens, and as always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For free cash flow, we expect to generate about $13.5 billion in 2025. Given the strong fundamentals of our business, we expect double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, which is the primary driver of our free cash flow. This will be offset by cash tax headwinds and higher CapEx. Our productivity initiatives have enabled investments in innovation, skills, and go-to-market capabilities, including our ecosystem. We have accomplished this while simultaneously growing our operating profit margin and free cash flow, which in turn has increased our financial flexibility.\nThis remains our playbook going forward, having executed on $3.5 billion of annual run rate savings exiting 2024, supporting our strong free cash flow growing in excess of revenue. Looking to the first quarter, I expect our constant currency revenue growth rate to be similar to the fourth quarter. We expect workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with prior year. We are also wrapping on the $241 million gain from the divestiture of The Weather Company. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the gain, we expect about 50 basis points of operating pre-tax margin expansion. It is hard to predict discrete events, but our best view is that the first quarter tax rate could be a few points lower than the full-year rate, but still a headwind over last year. In summary, we have delivered durable growth over the midterm model and expect to drive an upwards inflection.\nWe have repositioned our business and are excited about 2025 and beyond. We look forward to discussing more details at our upcoming investor day on 4 February 2025. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue.\nFor participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYep. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping we could just talk a little bit about when I think about the calendar 2025 guide you folks just provided, if you could just provide some context around linearity and how that could play out. Maybe we can talk about H1 versus H2 perspective, given, I think, some of the consulting and mainframe tailwinds could be a bit more back half, I would say. If you could just touch on kind of first half versus second half, or anything on the linearity, that would be helpful as you think about 2025.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, IBM\n\nHey, Amit. Thank you very much, and appreciate the question overall.\nObviously, we're very pleased, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, about how we finished on a strong note, over-delivering on revenue, profitability, earnings per share, free cash flow. That gives us the conviction and the confidence as we guided in 2025 with above-street revenue growth at 5% plus at constant currency and a very strong free cash flow engine of $13.5 billion growing nicely and continuing to grow that free cash flow margin. But if you look underneath it, linearity. When you get to that point, yes, first half. I would tell you, you got to answer this by segment. We've got a very strong portfolio, which is executing extremely well on software. We see a pretty normal history as we move through our first half, second half.\nObviously, you do have seasonality between Q1 and Q2, or Q3 and Q4, but we got a very hot hand, and we're going to continue to invest in innovation. Second, on consulting, we feel pretty good about how we concluded the year with our highest recorded ever signings quarter, up 23%. We entered the year with a backlog of +8%, a strong book-to-bill at 1.21. We're still dealing with a very dynamic environment around client prioritizing spend, and I think it's prudent for us right now, although we call low single-digit for the year, to see that accelerate as we move through the year. So I would see more of a second half play than a first half play. Then you get to infrastructure. We did extremely well at the end of a three-year cycle.\nOur most promising program and mainframe, I think, ever overall, delivering 122%. Yes, Q1, we expect again about a similar point impact to IBM's growth, but Q2 on, we're back to growth above our model through the year, and that's what gives us confidence in the guide that we called for the year. So a little bit of a mixed shift, definitely strength in software, which is going to drive this business being 45% IBM. But when you bring it all together, maybe it's a point less H1 on revenue versus history versus H2, but from a free cash flow perspective, we're pretty similar to history overall.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much, and congrats on the really strong free cash flow performance.\nArvind, I would love to get your thoughts around M&A, particularly as we may be entering a period of relatively low regulatory overhang. At the same time, you are delivering record cash flows. And if I could, would love to get some of your thoughts on DeepSeek and any implications that you see either for the industry broadly or for IBM in particular. Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. Look, we are looking forward to a regulatory environment that is a bit more rational and a bit more pro-competition. So I think what that implies for us is that we think reasonable deals have a very good chance of getting through in a reasonable amount of time and not being held up for years. So with that context, that means obviously we are going to lean in more, which is reasonable.\nIf you look at our free cash flow and you look at what we are setting out for the year, that could leave as much as $7 billion or a bit more than that during the year after accounting for the dividend. We always look at a three-year flexibility. I think that's the best way of looking at it, Wamsi. So if you look at a three-year flexibility, you can kind of borrow ahead, but we do kind of want to live within sort of what we can afford. If we find targets that meet our criteria, we are going to lean in and get things done. I'm going to just finish that by saying HashiCorp has been waiting out there for almost a year.\nWe certainly hope that with a friendlier environment, that gets done soon, and that then begins to open up the aperture for getting more deals done. So I think hopefully that addressed both the cash flows and the regulations around M&A. Look, DeepSeek, I think, was a point of validation. We have been very vocal for about a year that smaller models and more reasonable training times are going to be essential for enterprise deployment of large language models. We have been down that journey ourselves for more than a year. We see as much as 30x reduction in inference costs using these approaches. As other people begin to follow that route, we think that this is incredibly good for our enterprise clients. And we will certainly take advantage of that in our business, but I believe that others will also follow that route.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat.\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you maybe highlight two topics, one on consulting and one on the AI software side. On the consulting side of things, it's good to see the bookings that you're seeing, but can you maybe give us, historically, the context? Is IBM tends to lag the consulting business relative to some of your peers? But what is the level of confidence you have in the revenue yield and revenue recovery you talked about for the back half of the year? And how do you feel about the sort of revenue yield today versus, say, a year ago? And then secondly, on the AI software side, you mentioned the billion-dollar book of business purely within software. That's pretty substantial.\nWhile there's been some moving parts in terms of which products have gotten traction, which are the products of the ones you mentioned that you think are really going to be sort of standouts in the next couple of years from a software performance perspective? Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. I'll take the first one, and then Arvind can handle the second one around the products and software overall. When we take a look at it from a consulting perspective, we've been talking about we have been operating along with every other consulting company in a very dynamic macroeconomic environment. As with any technological shift, there are going to be reprioritization of spending that is occurring. Clients, similar to IBM, we are cutting back on discretionary-based spend so we can fuel investment into digital transformation and GenAI overall. We've been seeing that play out throughout 2024.\nBy the way, on top of above-market performance and gaining significant share over the last six quarters starting in 2023, now why have we been so maniacally focused on the GenAI ramp and our greater than $4 billion book of business right now coming out six quarters in, which we believe, by the way, we're in a very early leadership position around that? We're so maniacally focused because enterprise clients are making their strategic provider of choice decisions. We are feeling very good about that greater than $4 billion book of business, which, by the way, is already north of 5% of our total backlog, which is, as I told Amit in the first question, up 8% coming into 2025. Why is that important?\nBecause that is going to be a long-term future vector of growth for consulting for us to win that has a multiplier effect that will drag our software component of our business going forward. So we feel pretty good. While right now, early in the cycle, it has less yield. It has higher durations, but we think the TAM opportunity and that multiplier effect are going to grow into each other. And that's one of a couple of components on why we have conviction of inflecting back to growth in 2025 with consulting overall.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Jim. So let me take the question, Jim, on the parts about the software products, which I think will be standouts. I got to begin with our What's Next family. Our What's Next family encapsulates our primary products that incorporate LLMs and AI technology.\nOur What's Next code assistant on how we help our clients modernize their COBOL infrastructures. Our code assistant on how people leverage it for Java or Ansible have been absolute standouts and have been in market for almost a year. The rest of the What's Next family also, whether it's about deploying models using AI or getting the data ready and governance, have also been very strong drivers. The piece that most people have not been paying attention to, I want to point out, is in the Red Hat family. Both Red Hat for getting models deployed on a single server with GPUs, as well as what we are now going to be doing with our Neural Magic acquisition on how do you optimize and get the most effective use of the hardware using Red Hat.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, IBM\n\nAnd then when you have large deployments leveraging OpenShift for AI deployment are the final rounding out of the products. Look, to be candid, LLMs will infuse many, many other things, but the products I called out are the ones where we counted as direct AI products and directly driving the business, and that's what is counted in the numbers that Jim laid out.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks a lot. A couple of the questions were asked, so I'm going to ask about infrastructure. I also wanted to congratulate you guys. Your mixed shift towards software is really resonating. I'm going to ask about infrastructure. Two aspects, one is tied to it within software, is TPP. It's super profitable and growing 11%.\nI wanted to see where that fit in in terms of your guidance for the year and how sustainable that is. And I think that the AI assistant is having a big impact on that and so changing the way we may be thinking on that. And then with regard to infrastructure, which is a little bit tied to that segment, maybe I'm wrong, in terms of the mainframe and the delta in growth, if you could just be a little more prescriptive there and talk about why you have confidence that this will be a well-received cycle. Really appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay, thanks, Ben. This is Jim. I'll take this. First of all, thank you for the compliments. The team has worked extremely hard. We laid out a very ambitious three-year roadmap a few years ago when we spun off Kyndryl to reposition IBM.\nAs we talked about in prepared remarks, the team has executed and met or exceeded every single one of those targets that we put out to the street. So a lot of hard work here, but the beauty is we got a lot more to go, which we're extremely excited about. And we'll talk about that next week at Investor Day. But let's talk about TPP. First of all, you can't talk about TPP to the heart of your question without talking about the absolute tremendous execution of what's been happening with our mainframe cycle. This has been one of the longest programs and most consistent in terms of revenue growth that we've ever seen. And I think it's an instantiation of the value of our enduring platform in a hybrid cloud and AI era overall. 120+% prior program, 70% of the clients on mainframe are growing MIPS.\nThat is a very different profile than where we were 10 years ago. The installed MIPS are up 3x over the last few cycles. Now, why is that important? We run mainframe, yes, mission-critical workloads for, what, 97% of the mission-critical transactional processing around many of the different industries, banking, retail, and airlines, you name it. But we run it as a stacked economic platform play. TP is the mission-critical software on top of that. It's a key growth contributor capitalizing on those mainframe stacked economics. High source of revenue, high source of profit to fuel investment flexibility of us continuing this engine of innovation and software. It also provides a solid incumbency base for the multiplier effect. We grew our transaction processing 10% in 2024, exiting at 11%.\nThe underlying dynamics of that, I would say about four points of that growth is due to the capitalization of the underlying workloads that are driving mainframe. About three points of that is the investment in the new innovation that we've been bringing to the mainframe platform called watsonx Code Assistant for Z and how we're monetizing value of GenAI. And then about three points of that is back to historical price optimization. If you look at 2025, our guidance, where we called software continuing to accelerate, approaching double-digit, I would say prudently right now between Arvind and I, a consistent mid-single-digit growth in TP, and we'll see how that plays out with the new cycle of mainframe in '25.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please state your question.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks. This is Bo on for Brent.\nArvind, it would be great to get your view of the business climate, more specifically on the software side, but also more generally across business segments. What are you hearing from customers, and how are they thinking about their software budgets in 2025?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks. Look, I've been quite public and quite vocal around this topic, but let's acknowledge many of the things that occupy media headlines and then, as a consequence, that do occupy business leaders' heads. Geopolitical tensions, maybe on a better track right now, but certainly not solved. Interest rates, inflation, demographics, lack of skilled labor, supply chain. I think these issues all carry over into 2025.\nThat said, and I did spend last week in Davos, where you get to meet a few hundred of your colleagues from around the world, I would tell you there is more optimism in the business climate, and there is more optimism on the growth that is possible in 2025 compared to 2024. And we know all the reasons for that. Is it pro-innovation? Is it pro-growth? Is it pro-regulation, reducing friction? All those things, I believe, are going to result in a better environment in 2025. That then translates into how are companies going to grow. To a person, everybody believes technology is now essential for helping them grow. How can you service customers better? How can you market better? How can you reach people more? How can you get things done in minutes instead of hours? So software is the basis for all of those capabilities.\nI think to a person, the budget that they will touch last, if there is ever an issue, is their software budget. So that is what is giving us confidence also, as Jim talked about approaching double digits in software, is that software is essential to how people are going to achieve their business goals. And if you can get ahead in this year, it'll probably keep you ahead. So it becomes kind of a gift that keeps repeating for our clients.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions and congrats on the really strong free cash flow performance and guide. One clarification quickly was just, Jim, just want to make sure when we think about the 2025 outlook, is that inclusive or excluding HashiCorp?\nAnd then my broader question again for you, Jim, is just if you could walk through and quantify a bit more detail some of the free cash flow puts and takes as we go into 2025, just between the cash taxes, the CapEx, the EBITDA growth, any more detail would be super helpful just as we think about our model. Thanks so much.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Eric. And again, thanks for the compliments to the team here collectively around the world. Means a lot. Yeah, short answer on Hashi, as always, we guide all in. So we fully expect to close the Hashi transaction in a relatively soon period of time, as we saw in the K that was issued by HashiCorp overall. We fully expect that in this new administration environment.\nSo all-in revenue growth, profit margin guidance that we gave, and free cash flow, which, by the way, is growing faster than revenue. When you take a look underneath, we're extremely pleased with how we finished the last couple of years overall. Highest free cash flow margin in the history of our great company for 115 years. And oh, by the way, we exited 2024 with a free cash flow run rate above our mid-term model of what we laid out three years ago, consistently growing free cash flow well in excess of revenue overall. So that's what gives us the confidence and the conviction that all of the tough work on our portfolio optimization that has shifted much more to a software-centric, led hybrid cloud platform company, the productivity, which, by the way, executing north of $3.5 billion exit run rate, we got out in front of that.\nI would call that discipline. I would call that execution of a company gives us the conviction and confidence in our guide in 2025 that takes into account that dilution effect. HashiCorp in and of itself is probably about a point of revenue growth to IBM in the year. And it's probably many of you have done the math, $300 million, $0.30, give or take, of dilution. By the way, still a very attractive financial model coupled with the strategic fit and synergy because we do believe Adjusted EBITDA. We're well on our path of, within 12 months, accretive and free cash flow, within two years, accretive overall if you've been following HashiCorp's results. But the underlying dynamics of our free cash flow drive, over 100% of it's going to be delivered by high-quality, sustainable Adjusted EBITDA growth.\nThat is driving this company to a sustainable, durable, mid-single-digit growth, now 5+% . The underlying operating leverage we continue to generate in this business will drive double-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2025. That, just to put some dollar amounts around it, that's probably over $1.5 billion in and of itself. Now, mitigating some of that, one, we are going to continue to invest in this business. That CapEx number is going to go up a couple hundred million dollars as we invest in our software, our GenAI, our next-generation mainframe, et cetera. Quantum, by the way, we continue to invest in. Two, with that incremental profit dollar, we're going to pay more cash tax. That's a couple hundred million more there.\nAnd three, to the heart of your question, the net interest opportunity loss overall will probably be another $200 million overall. So when you put those pieces together, the way I would kind of qualify it, high-quality, sustainable free cash flow generation engine that's going to deliver faster in revenue growth.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman, President and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Olympia. Look, we do apologize from all of us. We were looking forward to your questions, but we will get multiple hours with the team, as Olympia said, on 4 February. So I do hope that those of you who couldn't get your questions in will come that day and ask your questions. Look, just to wrap up, as we have wrapped on our midterm model and Jim explained some of this, we executed on our strategy to deliver sustained revenue growth and cash.\nThe changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years and our performance reinforce my confidence in this next chapter of our growth. I look forward to continuing this dialogue and through the year.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Olympia McNerney, IBM's Global Head of Investor Relations. Olympia, you may begin.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Q2 2024 Earnings Presentation. I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our Investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us today to discuss IBM's Q2 earnings. We delivered a strong quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by solid revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow generation. We had strong performance in software and infrastructure above our model, as investment in innovation is yielding organic growth, while consulting remained below model. Our results underscore the continued success of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and the strength of our diversified business. Let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. Technology spending remains robust, as it continues to serve as a key competitive advantage, allowing businesses to scale, drive efficiencies, and fuel growth. As we stated last quarter, factors such as interest rates and inflation impacted timing of decision-making and discretionary spend in consulting. Overall, we remain confident in the positive macro outlook for technology spending but acknowledge this impact.\nIt has been a year since we introduced watsonx and our generative AI strategy to the market. We have infused AI across the business. From the tools clients use to manage and optimize their hybrid cloud environments to our platform products across .ai, .data, and .gov, to infrastructure and consulting, you can find AI innovation in all of our segments. For example, in software, a broad suite of automation products like Apptio and watsonx Orchestrate are leveraging AI, and we expect to do the same with HashiCorp once the acquisition is complete. Red Hat is bringing AI to OpenShift AI and RHEL AI. In transaction processing, we are seeing early momentum in watsonx Code Assistant for Z. In infrastructure, IBM Z is equipped with real-time AI inferencing capabilities. In consulting, our experts are helping clients design and implement AI strategies.\nOur enterprise AI strategy is resonating as we evolve to meet client needs. Let me start by discussing IBM models. Choosing the right AI model is crucial for success in scaling AI. While large general-purpose models are great for starting on AI use cases, clients are finding that smaller models are essential for cost-effective AI strategies. Smaller models are also much easier to customize and tune. IBM's Granite models, ranging from 3 billion to 34 billion parameters and trained on 116 programming languages, consistently achieve top performance for a variety of coding tasks. To put costs in perspective, these fit-for-purpose models can be approximately 90% less expensive than large models. Hybrid cloud remains a top priority for clients, as flexibility of deployment of AI models across multiple environments and data sovereignty remain a key focus.\nWe believe in the power of open innovation and recently announced at IBM Think that we open-sourced IBM's Granite family of models, now available under Apache 2.0 licenses on both Hugging Face and GitHub. We see parallels to Linux becoming dominant in the enterprise server space, thanks to the speed and innovation offered by open source. We are confident that the same dynamic will play out with AI as we benefit from developer mindshare and community innovation. We also recently launched InstructLab, a tool for more rapid model tuning through synthetic data generation, allowing our clients to more efficiently customize models using their own data and expertise.\nThe last 12 months of AI pilots have made it clear that sustained value from AI requires truly leveraging enterprise data. In summary, our AI strategy is a comprehensive platform play. RHEL AI and OpenShift AI are the foundation of our enterprise AI platform.\nThey combine open-source IBM Granite LLMs and InstructLab model alignment tools with full-stack optimization, enterprise-grade security and support, and model indemnification. On top of that, we have an enterprise AI middleware platform with watsonx and an embedded strategy with our AI assistants infused through our software portfolio and those of our ecosystem partners. In addition, our consulting services are critical in helping clients build their AI strategies from the ground up. We also continue to see our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Our book of business related to generative AI now stands at greater than $2 billion inception to date. The mix is roughly one-quarter software and three-quarter consulting signings. We believe these strong results highlight our momentum and traction with clients.\nOur early leadership positions us for long-term success, and this transformational technology, which is still in the initial stages of adoption. As clients build out AI strategies, the IT landscape is becoming increasingly complex. Labor demographic shifts further emphasize the importance of optimizing IT spend and automating business processes. We continue to innovate and invest and have created a leading automation portfolio to capture this opportunity, which you can see in our results. This includes Apptio for cost management, capabilities for observability and resource management, and with the announced acquisition of HashiCorp, the automation of cloud infrastructure. The powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible and Terraform will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. The latest addition to this portfolio is IBM Concert, also announced at Think, a GenAI-powered tool which helps clients get end-to-end visibility across business applications.\nWe also recently completed the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management, and data ingestion. Let me now spend a minute on the continued strength we are seeing in infrastructure. IBM Z, our mainframe solution, is an integral part of our clients' hybrid cloud environments, driving their most secure and mission-critical workloads. Our latest cycle, z16, is uniquely tailored to offer clients security, scalability, and resilience, which help clients address both cybersecurity threats and complex regulatory requirements. z16's Telum processor is a unique differentiator, driving real-time, inline AI inferencing at unprecedented speed and scale for applications like real-time fraud detection. Our storage offerings are also benefiting from generative AI, as clients address data readiness and need high-speed access to massive volumes of unstructured data.\nWe continue to invest in innovation and make great progress in emerging technology like quantum computing. This quarter, we expanded Qiskit, IBM's quantum computing software, into a comprehensive stack aimed at optimizing performance on utility-scale quantum hardware. These updates aim to enhance the stability, efficiency, and usability of Qiskit, supporting advanced quantum algorithm development and fostering broader adoption across various industries. The strong momentum and innovation across the portfolio manifest itself in client adoption. In virtually all industries and geographies, clients leverage IBM's solutions to help them transform their operations and create better experiences for end users. Names like Virgin Money, Crédit Mutuel, and Panasonic all turned to IBM in the quarter. We also continue to strengthen our ecosystem. At our Think event, we announced a series of new AI partnerships with industry leaders like Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Mistral, Salesforce, and SAP.\nIn May, IBM and Palo Alto Networks announced a partnership to deliver AI-powered security solutions using watsonx. As part of this, Palo Alto is acquiring IBM's QRadar SaaS assets, and we are partnering to offer seamless migration for QRadar customers to XSIAM. IBM will train over 1,000 security consultants on Palo Alto Networks products to drive a significant book of business with them. In summary, we are excited to continue delivering strong results. Given our first-half performance, we are raising our expectations for free cash flow to greater than $12 billion for the year. I will now hand over to Jim to walk you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. In the Q2, we delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion of operating pre-tax income, and $2.43 operating diluted earnings per share. Our 4% revenue growth at constant currency, combined with greater than 200 basis points of operating pre-tax margin expansion, drove 17% operating pre-tax income growth and 11% operating diluted earnings per share growth, highlighting our strong execution. Through the first half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow generation is the strongest first-half level we have reported in many years. We are pleased with these results, exceeding our expectations for revenue, profitability, free cash flow, and earnings per share. Revenue growth was led by software and infrastructure. It is clear that our investments in innovation are yielding results and driving strong organic growth across these segments.\nSoftware grew by 8%, with solid growth across hybrid platform and solutions, transaction processing, and strong transactional performance. Infrastructure had great performance, up 3%, delivering growth across IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. Consulting was up 2% and continued to be impacted by a pullback in discretionary spending. Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 190 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 220 basis points over the last year, inclusive of about a 30-basis-point currency headwind to pre-tax margin. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix, and ongoing productivity initiatives. Driving productivity is core to our operating and financial model. This includes enabling a higher-value workforce through automation and AI, streamlining our supply chain, aligning our teams by workflow, and reducing our real estate footprint.\nThese actions allowed for continued investment in innovation, with R&D up 9% in the first half. This includes investments in both AI and hybrid cloud, as well as infrastructure ahead of our next Z program in 2025, which we expect to accelerate our organic growth profile over time. Our results this quarter reflect broad-based growth and the strength in the fundamentals of our business, with revenue up about $300 million, operating pre-tax income up about $400 million, adjusted EBITDA up more than $350 million, and free cash flow up about $500 million. For the first half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this first-half growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $550 million year-over-year, and timing of CapEx.\nWe are a few points ahead of our two-year average attainment levels through the first half. In terms of cash uses, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position, with cash of $16 billion, up $2.5 billion since year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the Q2 was flat, with year-end 2023 at $56.5 billion, including $11.1 billion from our financing business. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals remain solid, with continued revenue growth, margin expansion, cash generation, and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business.\nTurning to the segments, software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing grew as clients leveraged the capabilities of our AI and hybrid cloud platforms. This performance reflects the investments we've been making in software, both organically, which drove more than 6 points of the growth, as well as acquisitions. As mentioned in January, the software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, the combination of innovation, recurring revenue, and transaction processing, as well as acquisitions.\nLet me spend a minute on each of these elements. In Red Hat, annual bookings growth accelerated to over 20% this quarter. Within that performance, OpenShift annual bookings were up over 40%, and RHEL and Ansible growth was double-digit. The strength reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions, including app modernization, management automation, generative AI, and virtualization. In a subscription-based business, the majority of revenue is under contract for the next two quarters. Think of it as our cRPO for the next six months.\nThis metric is growing in the mid-teens and accelerating more than 5 points versus the first half of the year. We continue to bring new innovation to our portfolio, and it's contributing nicely to our software performance. Our new innovation includes generative AI offerings like watsonx, our AI middleware, watsonx Assistant, the recently announced IBM Concert, and others, which contributed about $0.5 billion to our AI book of business inception to date. We delivered good growth across our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of the annual software revenue. This is evident in hybrid platform and solutions, where our ARR is now $14.1 billion and up 9% since last year. Transaction processing delivered 13% revenue growth. This performance demonstrates the innovation and value of our mission-critical hardware stack across IBM Z, Power, and Storage.\nThe combination of growing demand for capacity, good client renewals, and strong large-deal performance fueled our results. And notably, our new generative AI portfolio innovation, watsonx Code Assistant for Z, is resonating well with clients. Together, these dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue performance this quarter also benefited from our focused M&A strategy, including synergies realized across the portfolio. This included the recent Apptio acquisition. Less than 12 months since closing, we have accelerated annual bookings and are seeing an uptick in ARR growth, already in the mid-teens. The synergy between Apptio's FinOps offerings and our broader automation portfolio helps clients manage, optimize, and automate technology spending decisions. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG and expect the HashiCorp acquisition to close by year-end.\nLooking at software profit, gross profit margin expanded and segment profit was up over 350 basis points year to year, with the latter reflecting operating leverage driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter. Our consulting revenue was up 2%, consistent with last quarter and largely reflecting organic growth. In April, we discussed that we were seeing solid demand for our large transformational offerings as clients continue to prioritize driving productivity with AI and analytics. At the same time, we saw a pullback on discretionary projects as clients prioritized their spending.\nThe Q2 buying behavior played out much in the same way. Signings for the quarter were $5.7 billion, driven by solid demand for large engagements across finance and supply chain transformation, cloud modernization, and application development. This contributed to backlog growth of 5% year-over-year and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remaining over 1.15. Meanwhile, continued discretionary spending constraints impacted our small engagement performance and backlog realization in the quarter.\nAs Arvind mentioned, our book of business in generative AI inception to date is greater than $2 billion, and about three-quarters of it represents consulting signings, with strong quarter-over-quarter momentum. Our extensive industry and domain expertise has placed us in an early leadership role, which is crucial at the onset of a technology shift. IBM has both technology and consulting, which is a unique and powerful combination to help clients navigate this technology transition. Similar to previous technology shifts, such as the advent of the internet, globalization, and cloud computing, generative AI is driving the next wave of growth. In a human capital-based business, signings represent clients reprioritizing spend on this technology transition, while there is some potential for lift as the total addressable market expands.\nWe are delivering value in two ways. First, partnering with our clients to design and scale AI solutions, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners, or a combination. Second, we are developing new ways of working, driving productivity and improving delivery, all with our consulting advantage platform. In summary, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to grow revenues, cut costs, and change the ways they work, creating a significant opportunity for us. We are seeing this already as IBM is the strategic partner of choice for clients using this technology, including WPP, Elevance Health, and the UK's Department for Work and Pensions.\nTurning to our lines of business, business transformation revenue grew 6%, led by finance and supply chain transformations. Data transformation also contributed to growth. In technology consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth was driven by application modernization services.\nApplication operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. Looking at consulting profit, we expanded gross profit margins by 40 basis points, driven by productivity and pricing actions we have taken. Segment profit margin was modestly down, reflecting continued labor inflation and currency. Moving to infrastructure, revenue was up 3%. We're capitalizing on the strong and broad-based demand for our hardware platforms, especially IBM Z. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z revenue was up 8% this quarter. We're now more than two years into the z16 cycle, and the revenue performance continues to outperform prior cycles. Our clients are facing increasing demands for workloads, given rapid business expansion, the complex regulatory environment, and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks.\nIBM Z addresses these needs with a combination of cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe security, energy efficiency, and strong reliability and scalability. Increasing workloads translates to more Z capacity, or MIPS, which are up about threefold over the last few cycles. IBM Z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving both hardware and related software, storage, and services adoption. In distributed infrastructure, revenue grew 5%, driven by strength in both power and storage. Power growth was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10, led by SAP HANA. Storage delivered growth again this quarter, including growth in high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and solutions tailored to protect, manage, and access data for scaling generative AI.\nLooking at infrastructure profit, we delivered solid gross profit margin expansion, and segment profit accelerated quarter to quarter to the high teens. Segment profit margin was down 230 basis points in the quarter, reflecting key investments we're making in the business across areas like AI, hybrid cloud, and quantum, and almost a point of impact due to currency.\nNow, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our performance in the first half, with revenue growth reflecting the investments we've been making, both organically as well as acquisitions. Our focus on execution and the strength in the fundamentals of our business resulted in strong performance in the quarter across revenue, margin expansion, and growth in profitability and earnings. Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on revenue. We see full-year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end.\nFor free cash flow, given the strength in our performance in the first half, we feel confident in raising our expectations to greater than $12 billion, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. This also includes a modest contribution resulting from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, largely offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. We continue to expect the QRadar transaction to close by the end of Q3. On the segments, in software, we had solid first half performance, up more than 7%. This performance reflects strength in our recurring revenue base and early traction in GenAI. With this performance, we are raising our view of growth in software to high single digits for the year. Given ongoing productivity initiatives and operating leverage, we now expect software segment profit margin to expand by over a point.\nIn consulting, given the continued pressure we have seen on spending related to discretionary projects, we now expect low single-digit growth for the year and segment profit margin to expand by about a half a point. Given the strength in infrastructure in H1, we now expect it to be about neutral for the year, with segment profit margin in the mid to high teens. With these segment dynamics, we are raising our expectations of operating pre-tax margin expansion to over a half a point year to year. We are maintaining our view of operating tax rate in the mid-teens range, consistent with last year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 100 to 200-basis-point impact to revenue growth for the year. For Q3, we see revenue growth consistent with the full year.\nFor profit, we expect our net income skew through the Q3 to remain a couple points ahead of the prior year, driven by the strength of our business. Again, we expect the gain of the Palo Alto QRadar transaction will be offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. In closing, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and for the first half, driving confidence in our updated expectations. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit, and grow free cash flow for the year. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. Then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.\nAnd our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much. Your long-term model on transaction processing is low single digit, and you just posted a very strong quarter with 13% growth in the quarter. How should we think about the trajectory of that in 2024 and maybe in 2025? I know, Jim, you noted a few different things, including solid client renewals, and some strong large deal performance. Was there anything very episodic or unusually large within that mix as well? Thank you so much.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question overall. Very important. If you take a step back, we continue to be very pleased with our transaction processing performance overall. If you dial back to when we laid out our midterm model, we said we converted this to a growth factor, low single digit overall. And if you look at the last couple of years, we've been averaging mid-single digit or better overall. We shifted this now to a growth contributor. And why is that important? One, high source of profit and cash, the fund investment flexibility. And two, it provides a very solid incumbency base for the IBM multiplier effect.\nBut if you take a look at it, we are capitalizing on the strength that we've seen over the last three programs of our mainframe cycle. It's really instantiating the enduring value of that platform. Our MIPS over the last few programs are up 3x from an install perspective. And over 80% of our clients are growing MIPS on the mainframe. I think that was a very different picture when you dial back five, seven years ago already. We've taken that portfolio. We've invested now significantly, which I'll come to around watsonx Code Assistant for Z. But we've taken that from a down mid-single digit portfolio to now capitalizing on the stack economics of our mainframe execution and moved that to a low single digit. Now for the year, as you heard, we are taking up our guidance, just given the strength of first half, to mid-single digit.\nWhen you get into 2025, we'll talk about our guidance going forward. But we feel very confident that we can continue growing this. And that's why we're investing and bringing out new capabilities like watsonx Code Assistant for Z, which is resonating extremely well.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYes, thank you for taking the question. I'm wondering, maybe you can discuss how you think about AI signings and whether you believe they're really incremental or just a shift in client spending. And part of the reason I asked the question is if it looks like your AI book of business was up about $1 billion sequentially. You're saying three quarters of that is consulting, so it's $700+ million in consulting signings in the quarter.\nIf I take that out, your book to bill and the rest of your business is actually down. And despite the strong signings, you're lowering your consulting expectations for the year. So I'm just wondering, do you think AI investments in consulting are a shift in spending, or do you think they're accretive, or do you actually think they could even be cannibalistic to consulting spend and more broadly IT spend?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah. So Toni, let me start, and then Jim will add more color on this topic. First, it's a great question, and you laid out some of the dynamics that were going on in there. If we just step back and just look at our comments on the macroeconomic environment, we kind of stated that there is discretionary spend pressure in consulting.\nWhen you do have that pressure, but there is a demand for AI, I would look you in the eye and say, probably the bulk of that demand, not all, but the bulk, is indeed a shift from other areas of consulting. We don't actually believe it's cannibalistic to the point you're pointing out. Now, as time goes on and as people move from early experimentation and proving out the value to wanting to scale and really get the full benefits of generative AI, we do actually believe at that point, even for consulting, these will turn into accretive and additive. But we are still some time away from when that will happen. That is just to give you some color and acknowledging that the bulk, but not all, is a shift. Jim?\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah. Thanks, Toni, for the question. Just building on what Arvind said, I mean, first of all, we're very pleased with the early momentum that we've gotten with our book of business around GenAI, both on the technology side with our watsonx platform and now with our open innovation strategy around RHEL AI, OpenShift, Granite models, and InstructLab, etc. Let's just dive a little deeper into your question about consulting. Because I think when you look at consulting, first of all, why is it so important right now in an early part of a cycle? It's important because it's got to establish IBM Consulting as the strategic provider of choice for enterprises as they're going through what we like to call digital transformation 2.0 with GenAI. Everyone is looking for who is going to be their strategic provider and partner.\nI think $1.5 billion, over $1.5 billion book of business in the first 12 months, which, by the way, is in excess of the ramp we saw play out with hybrid cloud and Red Hat. We're off to a pretty good start. Now, to Arvind's point, in every technology shift, very different dynamics between a human capital-based business and a product IP business. Human capital-based business, we do see, and we expect it, clients will shift and reprioritize spending. They're doing that now as they're driving large enterprise transformation projects, which is what our portfolio has been able to capture. And that's why you see nice acceleration and growth in our backlog, healthy at 5%.\nBut to Arvind's point, we do think once you get through the early cycle, this is an incremental expansion of TAM that drives a long-tail growth vector over time that has multiplier opportunities for us. So when you look at our consulting book of business, let's dive into the subsegments. You see business transformation services, which a lot of the GenAI plays out to early right now. That is how do you transform the way you operate HR, finance, and supply chain. We've doubled and accelerated our growth quarter to quarter. What you're seeing is a reprioritization and dynamic spending decisions by clients because our AO, where we have a lot of short-term discretionary staff augmentation work, there's a lot of trade-offs between those two. So it's important for us strategically with our client base, but I think you see how it plays out.\nNow, just to wrap up the full picture, software, I think, is fundamentally different. Our software book of business now, half a billion dollars through the first 12 months. I think inception to date right now, we're about two-thirds subscription, SaaS, one-third perpetual. I think that's contributing nicely about a point of growth. And by the way, that's one of the two components of why we took our software up for the year. So I think that's predominantly all lift.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question's really on the consulting side. When I think about this business growing low single digits for 2024, if I take out some of the M&A contribution, also some of the revenue from the AI book of business that you have at $1.5 billion, is it fair to think that maybe the non-AI consulting piece actually gets worse in H2 versus H1 for you? If you just talk about the puts and takes on the back half consulting expectations versus front half, that would be really helpful. Then I'm curious, as you talk to your customers, what is your sense on the duration of this weakness in consulting, and when do you think it's tough to come back? Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nHi. So Amit, let me just start and maybe address the second part of your question first and then. I actually do not believe there's any secular macro trend around weakness.\nI think that this is temporal, based on a number of factors we have. The geopolitical uncertainty has gone longer than most people expected, and that weighs into people's heads about what might happen, and specifically the war in Europe as well as the war in the Middle East. Second, inflation has gone longer than people expected, which has the unfortunate consequence of higher interest rates, and that begins to bear on people. If I look at those two altogether, and then the moment you have higher interest rates and inflation, you have wage inflation, which does impact the bottom line of our clients. You put all of that into perspective, and is this going to go on for another six months? Likely. Is it going to go on for another year?\nI'm not so sure, but we got to get through the second half to be able to go there. So that is why we are optimistic about the medium and long-term vector on consulting. And as Jim answered in a prior question, we do see that this is going to become a tailwind over time, at least for us. Now, in the short term, for the next six months, we do think it holds up a little bit. In terms of answering the specifics and sort of decomposing some of the numbers that you laid out in the first part of your question, I'm going to turn that over to Jim.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah. Thanks, Arvind. And thanks, Amit, for the question overall. Let's put this in perspective, right? You go back 90 days ago. How did we see the year kind of playing out with consulting?\nWe said at that point in time, we had backlog growing nicely mid-single-digit, albeit we did talk about the ratios going up because large-scale transformations were really where the spend was moving to. But we had a solid book-to-bill trailing 12 months over 1.15. We had GenAI momentum that was going to continue throughout the year early in the cycle. We had strategic partnerships, Red Hat growth profile. And we had future acquisitions as we're going to continue to be opportunistic around our M&A criteria and the synergistic value of how consulting plays to our portfolio. If you look right now, 90 days later, as we look to the second half, many of those are still playing out. You got GenAI, which arguably we're above our own expectations right now, doubling, by the way, in consulting.\nOur GenAI book of business quarter to quarter, strategic partnerships, especially hyperscalers, Red Hat, still growing nicely. What you're seeing at the end of the day, those are large-scale transformations, lower yield. That's why Arvind and I are saying these are longer-term growth vectors and tails that will play out into 2025, 2026, and beyond as we get that strategic provider of choice. But in the interim, what you're seeing is that spending reprioritization around short-term discretionary, that I think everyone in the industry is talking about. We're all dealing with this. The key is we have to win that strategic provider of choice in GenAI. And I would argue we're off to a great start. You look at competitor numbers overall, we got $1.5 billion over $1.5 billion book of business, doubling quarter to quarter right now.\nI think we're in pretty good shape. That's what we're focused on because that will provide the future revenue multiplier effect as we move forward.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking my question. Maybe if I could just ask on a different topic for a second, can we maybe talk about the environment you see right now for M&A and your intention to continue to drive through acquisitions? And do you believe you have sufficient scale in open source and DevOps software in particular? And can you maybe comment on the attractiveness of multiples in the public market today relative to the private market?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nHey, Jim. Great question. And thank you for asking this. Look, on overall M&A, I just want to begin with that our strategy has not changed. We are disciplined, and we are focused. By focused, I mean we stick to the areas that we are investing in, hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. And by discipline, I mean it has to be not just aligned to our strategy, but we expect synergy from the acquisition, especially the multiples are higher, as you pointed out.\nAnd it has to be accretive to free cash flow. If it's larger, definitely within two years at the outer end of the range. Having said that, if I look at it right now, we have HashiCorp out there. We got to get through that. We expect that to happen in the second half of this year. We just finished StreamSets and webMethods, and we've done a couple of smaller ones in the consulting space and in other technology tuck-ins. All right. What do we see going into the space? Our valuation's rich. They're reasonably rich.\nThey're not outrageous, I would say, like they had become in parts of late 2020 and 2021. So I would say that they're more reasonable than then, but they're richer than they were about 18 months ago. There are different dynamics in both the public and the private markets. Public markets are quite variable. I mean, as we can see, some of the multiples, and if you look at multiples to revenue, which is not a great metric, let me just acknowledge that, but it is one that's out there. If you look at six, seven, eight, maybe nine or 10 times, we can see our way there for a large deal as long as we have sufficient synergy. Now, for very small deals, that's not even a fair multiple. Very small deals are all about technology and people.\nIn the private market, we were very pleased with what we got done on StreamSets and webMethods. I would call that a private market deal, not a public market deal. And there, I think it all depends upon what's the property, what is its growth profile, what is the attractiveness of it to the seller versus the buyer, in this case, us. All of that plays into those multiples. I do expect that on the private side, valuations will be slightly less, but then the risk of going public or some other exit is also taken away. And in some sense, you get a discount for taking that risk off the table. For people who are venture-backed, that's different. They're looking at IPO versus a strategic exit, and those are different multiples. But putting all of that together, we remain in the market.\nM&A is an important part of our growth methodology. We maintain a strong balance sheet for that purpose, and we've kind of been clear of that. All that said, this year, we got a big one coming. So we want to wait and get that done because part of the discipline is also making sure that we kind of digest them at the right rate, pace, and put them into our global go-to-market distribution engine.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Hey, thank you. Appreciate it. Jim, and Arvind, I wanted to see if it sounds like the margin progress is sustainable for the year. While I appreciate that you guide to free cash flow and you've raised it a little bit, do you anticipate us being able to flow through the $0.25 of upside on the EPS line? And does that mean earnings are sustainable in the back half? And then I was just wondering if you have any more info on HashiCorp in terms of the revenue contribution? Street was looking for about $750 million in revenue next year. And on the dilution, there should be a loss of around $0.30 in interest income. Just wondering if you have any further views on the net effect to 2025 on that deal. Thanks so much, guys.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nHey, Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Very good question overall. But let's take a step back on your first part of the question around free cash flow.\nYes, we're very pleased with the start of the year. Free cash flow, $4.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year to year, four points above historical attainment. It's our largest first-half free cash flow generation as far back as I can go and count. So we're off to a pretty good start. And that gives us the confidence overall of how we're positioning second half. But the second half and why we took the guidance up is entirely driven by the strength of the fundamentals of our business and flowing through the adjusted EBITDA overachievement. So read that, although we don't guide on EPS. The strong overachievement of the $0.25 of EPS, we're flowing that through to adjusted EBITDA, and that flows through to our guide take-up on free cash flow.\nThe rest of the free cash flow dynamics we've been talking about all year long around, yes, we got benefits, the change in retirement plans and cash tax that's going to be a headwind, and other balance sheet items. None of that changes. One thing I will bring up, and we said in the preparatory remarks, but just so there's absolute clarity, we do expect to close the Palo Alto Networks transaction here in Q3 around certain assets of our QRadar business that will obviously generate a gain. We're excited about the new strategic relationship between our two great companies overall, but we will take structural actions to offset that gain to address stranded cost, and oh, by the way, to your second part of your question, to accelerate our productivity initiatives in 2025. You get to HashiCorp. First of all, the strategic transaction stands on its own.\nArvind went through our M&A criteria. I think there's a very compelling strategic fit around an end-to-end leadership hybrid cloud platform. There's a lot of synergistic value both on product technology and go-to-market. But there's a very attractive financial profile that we talked about 90 days ago: higher revenue growth profile, adjusted EBITDA accretive in 12 months, free cash flow accretive to Arvind's point by two years. And we do see potential significant near-term cost and operating synergies that lead to about 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business over a handful of years. Now, when you look at dilution, we understand dilution. I mean, M&A has been an integral part of our financial model for decades. Underneath that, we understand the purchase growth of those transactions, the synergies of those transactions, the balance sheet capital structure implications of those.\nWith all that said, our model is to grow mid-single digit revenue and grow operating leverage so we grow free cash flow quicker than revenue. We don't see that changing in 2025. We see growth profiles around revenue, around operating leverage, and around free cash flow overall. That speaks to the diversity or diversification, I should say, of our business model around productivity. We entered the year, raised it to $3 billion. We're getting out ahead of that again. And you see that play out in our margins through the first half, what, up 180 basis points on pre-tax. So we've got many levers to deal with this overall, and we know how to handle it.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Arvind or Jim, I'd love if you could just dig into the Red Hat business a bit more. Over the last few quarters, you've talked about some very healthy bookings growth numbers ranging anywhere between, call it, 15% and 20%. But we did see growth obviously decelerate by about a point this quarter despite expectations that it would be flat to maybe increasing for the rest of the year. So can you just kind of double-click on exactly what you're seeing with the Red Hat business today? What's kind of the offset to the strong bookings numbers? And how should we think about Red Hat growth now in constant currency for 2024? Thanks so much.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nGreat question, Erik. So let's just look at the Red Hat business in terms of how the dynamics function between our clients and ourselves. So clients come in, create demand. We fulfill that. That shows up as bookings, not as revenue, because the Red Hat business model is a pure consumption business model.\nClients pay for what they're consuming, and so the bookings then play out. Now, those bookings are a signal of further demand, and typically, they're anywhere from one to three years' worth of revenue that the client is pre-committing to. So when we enter a year, about half the revenue, we can look at the bookings of the previous year and say that that gives us. The other half has to come over the quarter. Now that we have a year, not longer, but a year of the double-digit demand that you're talking about, if I remember right, it was 14%, 17%, 14%, 20% in terms of those demands. Now that that full year is there, that points to that for the portion that we can see.\nAs we get into a quarter, it climbs up from that 50% to 60% to 70% to 80%. Jim mentioned in his preparatory remarks what he called cRPO, or the revenue performance obligations. We see those sitting around mid-teens for the second half of the year, to answer your question. Now, if that's about 80%, then that will translate into low double-digit, is what we can look at and feel quite comfortable on. By the way, we see these early signs of the demand continue into this quarter and likely the half, which means that we expect to continue now in the low double digits going forward. So I hope that that gives you a sense. But I'm also excited by the underlying product capabilities. We see OpenShift, which is extremely important. It plays into containerization. It plays into virtualization.\nIt's an important element of how our clients exercise hybrid. It has been growing, and the demand there grew again at about 40% this past quarter. But we also saw acceleration in Linux and in Ansible, where both of those demand vectors grew into the low double digits. That, given the size of the Linux business, is very good news for us going forward. So I hope that that gives you some color on those pieces. And a vector that we have not talked about that will play, but probably into 2025 and 2026, we are very excited by our two open-source AI projects inside the Red Hat business, RHEL AI, as well as OpenShift AI.\nAs people begin to deploy at scale, but not only on public cloud, but also on-premise, leveraging their hybrid environments, we expect that both of those will also contribute into the Red Hat business, but that will take more time.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Yeah. Arvind, if we could pick up right where you left off there, can you just give us a little more color on the decision to open up the Granite models and the code base? Then really kind of what you're seeing in the market that makes you feel like taking maybe a more developer-focused approach to those, I think, as you put it, fit-for-purpose models is the right long-term strategy?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM",
    "content2": "So Matt, thank you for asking that question. And there was actually a question on developers before also, so I'm sorry we didn't get to it fully.\nWe'll get to it now in this question. Look, the whole question comes down to there was a thesis out there about a year and a half ago that maybe one, maybe two extremely large models are going to run away with the bulk of the market share. We always felt that was both technically and economically infeasible. And I'll describe why. If you run an extremely large model on public cloud, the model by its nature is going to be expensive because a very large model needs a lot more compute, a lot more network, a lot more storage, and a lot more memory. And we can see some of those dynamics play out. If you can drop the model size, you can drop all of that by 90%.\nI would actually tell you 99% reduction in the compute, memory, and network costs, but let's call it 90% just for the sake of argument. So if you are running, like one of our clients was describing to me, they run a couple of billion transactions through their internal systems each day. If they had to go service those out to a large public cloud, the bill per day would have come back to be a couple of hundred million dollars. You multiply that by 250, that's kind of an infeasible cost. If you can drop it by 90%, you're now bringing it down to the $10 to 20 million a day. If you can actually run it using some of our Red Hat technologies on-premise, you can drop it by another 50%. You're now talking $5 to 10 million.\nFor what it can do, that is a very attractive proposition. So now getting back to the models. If you have no idea what you're going to do, if you have no idea what you might be looking for, you go to a very large model because it contains all the possible elements. If you have a sense of what you need to do, I need to summarize emails. You need an English-language model if you're sitting here in the United States. If you are going to go change your Java or C++ or Python programmers to be more productive, you don't need a model that can write poetry and draw images. You need a model that understands programming languages. So we are very, very proud of what our team has done. We can produce models that can do these things.\nSo these are two distinct models, one for programming, one for business language. They are one-tenth or less than that of the size of the extremely large models. But you can look on the leaderboards. They perform quite as well as the largest models. So that is kind of what our strategy is. However, if our clients want other models, we are also happy to work with other models, and we have had that perspective. So why open source since that was part of your question? Why open source is because often we find that clients want to increase the model's efficacy by adding their own unique language. People might want to write emails in a certain way. They might want to program in a certain way. They like comments in a certain style. I call that refining the model. We have a technique called InstructLab.\nBut then clients get concerned. Wait, if I add my data, I don't want to give that away and back into a more public format. Can I keep that to myself? So open sourcing our models under the Apache license gives our clients the freedom that what they add onto our underlying open model, they can keep to themselves. Now, to the developer point, putting all of that machinery into Red Hat Linux now gives us an avenue to open it up to developers that they can go experiment and play. By the way, I'll turn around and tell you that for a developer who's not running production, who's just playing with things like our people do it on a MacBook, you can begin to play around with models that are in the low tens of billions of parameters.\nThat's a massive market that opens up. They get the freedom and flexibility that they don't have to give it back to us unless they want to. I am not actually concerned about this gives away the IP. As we have found through whether it's Red Hat Linux or whether other people have found through Mongo or other people have found through Hadoop. Enterprises do look for, and the last few days have certainly shown us, people look for patching, people look for security, people look for backward compatibility. There's a lot of enterprise reasons why people will still do business with us.\nBut the open-source nature of what you asked, and I'm so glad you did, allows us to expand that market into the millions of developers who do run Linux on their home machines or their corporate machines or their laptops, and they can go experiment, add their innovation, and either give it back to the community or actually reserve it for their enterprise. So that's how we kind of tap into the whole developer ecosystem.\nSo let me now wrap up the call. In Q2 2024, we executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation. We saw strong performance across our portfolio. We're excited about our early traction in generative AI. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year. Thank you all.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Arvind. Operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Olympia McNerney, IBM's Global Head of Investor Relations. Olympia, you may begin.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Q1 2024 earnings presentation. I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jame Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our Investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us. In Q1, we had solid performance across revenue and cash flow. These results are further proof of the quality of our portfolio and our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We had good performance in software at the high end of our model. Continued strength in infrastructure above our model, while consulting was below model. On a relative basis, consulting outperformed the market. Our cash flow generation is the strongest Q1 level we have reported in many years. This performance speaks to the strength of our diversified business model. Before we get into more detail on the quarter, let me address the announcement of our agreement to acquire HashiCorp, a company we have partnered with for a long time and believe is a tremendous strategic fit with IBM.\nEnterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure applications across public and private clouds, as well as on-prem environments, making this the ideal time to pursue this acquisition. As generative AI deployment accelerates alongside traditional workloads, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic, and complex infrastructure strategies. HashiCorp has a proven track record of helping clients manage the complexity of today's infrastructure by automating, orchestrating, and securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp is a great strategic addition to our portfolio, extending Red Hat's hybrid cloud capabilities to provide end-to-end automated infrastructure and security lifecycle management. HashiCorp's technology is foundational to enabling the transition to hybrid and multi-cloud, and Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure automation for these environments. With security top of mind for every enterprise, Vault is a powerful secrets management offering to automate identity security across applications.\nThe combination will also bolster our leading IT automation platform to address the sprawling complexity of AI-driven application and infrastructure growth. HashiCorp's products have wide-scale adoption in the developer community, highlighting the pervasive nature of their technology, used by over 85% of the Fortune 500 and downloaded over half a billion times. The acquisition of HashiCorp builds on IBM's commitment to industry collaboration, the developer community, and open-source hybrid cloud and AI innovation. Today's acquisition is consistent with our M&A strategy. We have taken a disciplined approach to M&A, and HashiCorp aligns well across all our key criteria to continue to focus and strengthen our portfolio on hybrid cloud and AI, deliver synergies with the rest of IBM, and be near-term accretive to free cash flow. I will now turn it to Jame to discuss the financial implications.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThank you, Arvind. Let me start with the details of the transaction. We have agreed to acquire HashiCorp for $6.4 billion in enterprise value to be funded by cash on hand. The transaction was approved by HashiCorp's Board of Directors. Closing is anticipated by the end of 2024, subject to approval by HashiCorp's shareholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. We have been executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and the acquisition of HashiCorp meets all of our criteria, including strategic fit, as Arvind just walked through, synergies across IBM, and financial accretion. Let me start by addressing synergies. We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp. Product synergies span across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation, and consulting.\nFor example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible automation platforms, configuration management, and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. We are well positioned to drive growth for HashiCorp by leveraging IBM's enterprise incumbency and global reach. With 70% of the revenue today coming from the U.S., the opportunity to scale HashiCorp across IBM's operations in 175 countries is significant. We also believe we can accelerate HashiCorp's adoption with IBM clients. To put this in perspective, only about 20% of the Forbes Global 2,000 are HashiCorp customers, and just a quarter of HashiCorp customers result in more than 100,000 annual recurring revenue, underscoring the opportunity to better monetize and upsell their products. Bringing it all together, the acquisition allows us to deliver a more comprehensive hybrid cloud offering to enterprise clients, enhancing IBM's ability to capture global cloud opportunity.\nThis will drive a higher growth profile over time. Finally, we expect to realize operating efficiencies and expect the transaction to be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA within the first full year post-close and to free cash flow in year two. Significant near-term cost synergies underpin the financial profile of the transaction, while product synergies represent further upside. We are very comfortable with our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile, and solid investment grade rating, and remain committed to our dividend policy. I'll now turn it back to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nNow, turning back to the quarter, let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. We expect the global economy to behave similarly to last year, albeit with some uncertainty due to persistently high interest rates. There are reasons to believe technology will be even more important in 2024 as clients focus on productivity improvements and customer experience. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. I will now provide some details on the execution of our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI. Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. This year, we anticipate more clients moving from experimenting to deploying AI at scale to unlock productivity. We are pleased with the solid progress of our AI offerings. Each quarter, we are winning more clients, expanding partnerships, and introducing new innovations.\nInception to date, our book of business related to watsonx and generative AI is greater than $1 billion, with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Similar to last quarter, this remains weighted towards consulting. We believe our comprehensive AI strategy is well positioned to help clients scale AI. We developed our watsonx platform for clients to build their AI solutions, spanning from foundation model training to data preparation, and governance. This includes both IBM Granite models and third-party models, giving our clients variety as well as the efficiency, and focus on enterprise domains that IBM brings. We have leveraged watsonx to build AI assistance through our software portfolio. Our consultants are helping clients navigate the AI landscape. And finally, we are seeing our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Let me touch on these infrastructure dynamics briefly.\nAs AI becomes widely adopted, IBM Z is uniquely advantaged. We believe a lot of AI inferencing will happen where the data is for security, efficiency, and latency reasons. Our full-stack focus, from on-chip AI processing to AI accelerator cards to watsonx platform support, allows models to be built and trained on any platform and easily deployed on IBM Z. The Telum chip is a unique differentiator, enabling real-time AI inferencing. Generative AI is also driving lift for our storage offerings, where industry-leading performance and scalability are utilized for data curation, model building, and fine-tuning. For enterprises to deploy AI at scale, AI is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It requires tuned, domain-specific models trained with quality data to maximize its impact. Clients value the flexibility of our approach.\nThey appreciate having the ability to leverage a combination of AI models, whether they are IBM's, their own models, open-source models such as Llama from Meta, and Mixtral from Mistral, and they can deploy these AI models across multiple environments. The flexibility we offer is resonating as there are use cases for both large and more efficient models. We are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. We see early parallels to Linux in making open-source AI models performant for enterprise use. We believe that IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open-source AI. As you know, we have done a lot of work with AI models and recently released a family of state-of-the-art open-source code models from our Granite series.\nRed Hat and IBM also recently launched InstructLab to evolve and improve AI models through incremental community contributions, much like open-source software. This open strategy is resonating around the world. We recently announced a collaboration with the Spanish government to leverage IBM's investments across the entire AI stack and open-source to build the world's leading suite of foundation models proficient in the Spanish language. Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service, and digital labor remain top of mind for our clients. This quarter, we signed a multi-year contract with Providence Health to reimagine talent and HR workflows with AI from IBM and partners. We are also providing data-driven insights and enabling Spanish language narration for this year's Masters Golf Tournament. Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth.\nThis quarter, we progressed strategic partnerships with a number of industry leaders, joining forces with NVIDIA to accelerate clients' AI journeys. ServiceNow will embed watsonx AI capabilities into the ServiceNow platform to accelerate enterprise digital transformation. We also expanded our relationship with Adobe around OpenShift and watsonx as it relates to the Adobe Experience Platform. We continue to invest in emerging technology as well, bringing new innovations to the market. Since we put the world's first Quantum System on the cloud in 2016, we have deployed over 80 Quantum System, and our users have run over three trillion programs to date. We just installed a Quantum System One at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This is the first IBM Quantum System on a college campus anywhere in the world. This installation will advance research in critical areas such as energy storage, material science, and financial modeling.\nAs always, focusing our portfolio remains a key priority. We closed the sale of The Weather Company in Q1 and expect to close the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG by mid-year. Overall, we had a positive start to the year, which gives us confidence in our next quarter and fulfill your expectations. Jame will now take you through the details of the quarter. Jame, over to you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. In the first quarter, we delivered $14.5 billion in revenue, $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, $1.7 billion of operating pre-tax income, and $1.68 operating earnings per share. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up approximately $600 million year-over-year. Our revenue for the quarter was up 3% at constant currency. We saw an impact to our top-line performance from the closing of The Weather Company earlier than expected in the quarter. Software grew by 6% with growth across hybrid platform, solutions, and transaction processing, and continued strength in our recurring revenue base. Consulting was up 2%, reflecting organic growth. We continue to have solid signings performance and a trailing 12-month book to bill of over 1.15. Infrastructure had strong performance, delivering growth across all of our hardware offerings.\nLooking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 130 basis points over last year, inclusive of about a 100 basis point currency headwind to pre-tax margin. At the end of January, we closed on the divestiture of The Weather Company, generating a pre-tax gain of $241 million in the quarter. Mitigating that benefit, we took charges of $374 million to address workforce rebalancing. Operating pre-tax margin was up 50 basis points, excluding the year-over-year impacts of workforce rebalancing and divestiture dynamics. We are pleased with this performance, in line with our guidance of roughly 50 basis points of operating pre-tax margin improvement in 2024. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix, and ongoing productivity initiatives. This allowed for continued investments to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense.\nThe timing of discrete tax items this quarter resulted in an operating tax rate of about 6%. We are still expecting a full-year operating tax rate consistent with last-year. Overall, the combination of our revenue and operating margin performance resulted in 7% growth in our adjusted EBITDA. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash-flow, up $600 million year-over-year. This growth reflects the performance of our underlying business, with adjusted EBITDA up $200 million year-over-year, and about $400 million from timing of balance sheet dynamics and CapEx. Over the last 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $11.8 billion. This puts us on track to deliver about $12 billion of free-cash flow for the year, with the growth largely driven by adjusted EBITDA.\nSince our acquisition of Red Hat, excluding 2021 when we spun off Kyndryl, our operating net income to free cash flow realization averaged 120%. Two factors drive this. One is stock-based compensation, which today represents 15 points of realization. And two, given the shift in our portfolio to a growing software business, deferred income also contributes to our realization. In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position, with cash of $19.3 billion, up from $13.5 billion at year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was $59.5 billion, including $9.9 billion from our financing business. Turning to the segments, software revenue grew 6%, with good performance across both hybrid platform and solutions, and transaction processing.\nAs mentioned in January, the software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, acquisitions, strong recurring revenue, and transaction processing. This is just how the first quarter played out. Hybrid platform and solutions revenue was up 7%. Let me spend a minute on the various elements. Red Hat revenue grew 9%, reflecting solid performance across the three key solutions: RHEL, OpenShift, and Ansible. Annual bookings growth was again in the mid-teens, with OpenShift up over 40% this quarter, and RHEL and Ansible each up double digits. Beyond Red Hat, recent acquisitions contributed to the growth profile of hybrid platform and solutions, as did new innovation areas, including watsonx. The combination of Apptio, acquired mid-last year, and our IT automation portfolio has delivered strong results, unlocking the full benefits of a FinOps solution for technology investments across hybrid cloud environments.\nIn fact, just this quarter, we partnered with Microsoft to bring Apptio to Azure and will co-sell to our joint customers. And Microsoft has agreed to adopt Apptio's capabilities in parts of their organization. Our revenue performance continues to reflect growth in our high-value recurring revenue base. Our ARR, after removing The Weather Company and security services, is now $13.9 billion, up over 8% since last-year. Transaction processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms. And there's an increasing interest in generative AI application modernization capabilities, like watsonx Code Assistant for Z. Software segment profit was up 80 basis points, while absorbing both key investments and innovation, and about a point of currency impact in the quarter.\nWe continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance this quarter. Our consulting revenue was up 2%. We continue to see clients prioritizing large data and technology transformation projects focused on driving productivity with AI and analytics. These results reflect the organic performance of our business. Solid demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 4%, our highest absolute Q1 signings in recent history, and our trailing 12-month book to bill ratio remains over 1.15. Our overall backlog remains healthy, up 7% year-over-year, and backlog erosion levels remain stable. At the same time, we saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large-scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tightened discretionary spending.\nContributing to growth across the business this quarter, our strategic partnerships continue to make up over 40% of our consulting revenue, with both AWS and Azure practices growing double digits. Additionally, our Red Hat practice grew revenue double digits. Expanding upon our partnerships, we are leveraging Microsoft Copilot to drive productivity for our clients. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful book of business around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are ahead of pace at this stage with our generative AI book of business. Turning to our lines of business, business transformation revenue grew 3%, led by supply chain, and finance transformations. Customer experience transformations also contributed to growth. Technology consulting revenue was also up 3%, with double-digit growth in cloud modernization projects, and both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements delivered double-digit growth.\nApplication operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management projects, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. Moving to consulting profit, we delivered over 8% segment profit margin, which is flat year-to-year. Our segment profit margin was impacted by about a point of currency, offsetting improvements in pricing and productivity actions we have taken. Moving to infrastructure, revenue grew, reflecting growth in hybrid infrastructure of 6% and declines in infrastructure support of 7%. Within hybrid infrastructure, growth was broad-based, with strong demand from our hardware offerings across IBM Z, Power, and Storage. In IBM Z, revenue was up 5% in the eighth quarter of z16 product availability. Now, two years in, this product cycle continues to resonate with clients and surpass z15 revenue performance. IBM Z is uniquely positioned for AI, with the first processor designed with on-chip acceleration for real-time AI inferencing.\nIn fact, we're working with over 100 clients on the application of AI on z16. Use cases range from fraud detection, anti-money laundering, and anomaly detection. This remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption, but also related software, storage, and services. Distributed infrastructure delivered 7% revenue growth, which strengthened both Power and Storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads. Storage delivered strong double-digit revenue growth, including demand for high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle. Clients are also looking to our storage offerings for data curation, model building, and fine-tuning in support of generative AI. Looking at infrastructure profit, we deliver both gross profit and segment profit margin expansion. Segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing about a point of impact from currency.\nNow, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. More than two years into our midterm model, we are a more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue and free cash flow growth. Over this time, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem, and drive productivity across our business. Our first-quarter performance is another proof point of this progress, with constant currency revenue growth, operating gross margin, operating pre-tax margin expansion, and the strongest first-quarter free cash flow in many years. Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on our two primary metrics: revenue and free cash flow. We see full-year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end.\nFor free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. On the segments in software, we had a solid start to the year and continue to expect growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations, though, as I said, we are seeing some pressure on smaller, more discretionary projects. We now see mid-single-digit revenue growth in consulting, with acceleration throughout the year. Given our ongoing productivity initiatives and investment in innovation, we expect to see about a point of segment profit margin expansion in both of these segments. In infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect revenue to decline, driving about a half a point impact to our overall growth. Given IBM Z cycle dynamics, we expect segment profit margin to be lower year-over-year.\nWith these segment dynamics, we continue to expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about a half a point year-to-year, consistent with our view 90 days ago. We are maintaining our view of operating tax for the year to be consistent with last year in the mid-teens range. We took a workforce rebalancing charge this quarter, and as I mentioned 90 days ago, we continue to see the overall amount this year consistent with last year. We expect this to pay back by the end of the year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 150 basis-200 basis point impact to revenue growth for the year, which is about one point worse than 90 days ago. For Q2, I expect our constant currency revenue growth rate to be consistent with the full year.\nOur tax rate is expected to be in the high teens. For profit, we expect the first-half skew of net income will remain a couple points ahead of the prior year. In closing, we are pleased with our performance to start the quarter. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit margin, and grow free cash flow for the year. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jame. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. Then, second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please state your question.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYep. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess I was hoping you could talk a bit more on the consulting side of the business because revenues did decelerate rather notably in March quarter, but I think on the other side, your AI-centric backlog at over $1 billion is doing extremely well. So I'm hoping you could touch on the near-term side. What are you hearing from your customers? What are they telling you around the duration of this pause? Because I think the expectation of mid-single-digit growth would imply this business will recover rather quickly. So I'd just love to get a sense on what are customers for you in consulting in terms of the duration of the pause.\nThen longer term, what does the opportunity look like given the AI-centric backlog appears a lot more robust versus what I think folks would have expected beyond 2024? Thank you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Amit. I appreciate the question. Let's take a step back because I think you're seeing some interesting dynamics in the consulting industry overall. And let's bifurcate it between how you asked the question. Let's look at real demand that's being measured in bookings, and then let's talk about what's happening with the revenue realization. On demand, we continue to see and capitalize on solid demand in key areas around digital transformation, application modernization, and GenAI. Our signings in the quarter, up 4%, were the strongest absolute first-quarter signings we've had as far back as I can go. We have a strong book to bill, over 1.15 on a trailing 12 months. Our backlog dynamic is in a very strong position, 7% overall, with stable erosion, but our duration has been going up the last two quarters. It's been up a couple months.\nBut let's talk about the underpinnings of what's driving demand because I think that's what's most important around the key growth focus areas. You talked about GenAI. GenAI for IBM, Arvind indicated, inception to date, over a $1 billion book of business. Consulting in the first quarter, the book of business on GenAI was 2X all of last year. So I think we're winning in the marketplace. We're taking share. And by the way, we're well above that ramp we saw with regards to Red Hat. Our strategic partnerships still have great velocity. Book to bill, well north of 1.2. Our Red Hat book of business is now $2.8 billion ARR around hybrid cloud. And we're seeing very nice acceleration in GenAI and digital transformation around core workflow use case areas of finance, supply chain, HR, and talent.\nSo I think in the key focus areas, our demand profile still continues to be good. Now, let's translate that to revenue. Revenue, first of all, in Q1, as we indicated, was all organic. We wrapped on our acquisitions. We continue to operate a very disciplined M&A process, and we continue to be opportunistic. But that 2% revenue growth was all organic, quarter to quarter. Second, in this marketplace, you look at competition, we're taking share still. So when you look at it, 90 days ago, we talked about the year. We talked about the year was going to play out accelerating throughout the year. Why? Because, one, we knew we had a strong backlog, and that backlog realization showed us that it was going to play out throughout the year with sequential improvement. But second, Easter.\nEaster, we knew, calendar was there, was at the end of March. That does impact a human capital-based business on the number of billing days. So when you looked at Q1, that backlog duration extending out a couple months, we also saw, though, less revenue backlog yield. And that really played out if you look at our subsegments and application operations. That's centered around custom AMS applications, which, by the way, many of that, as you know quite well, is volume-based business. And that volume, like I said, backlog is stable overall. We're not losing the business. That is moving out to the right. So with all that said, what are we focused on? We're focused on capturing new client demand in areas around our key growth areas. Two, we're continuing to focus, and we are gaining share in the marketplace.\nThree, we're driving that economic multiplier of consulting and technology across our hybrid cloud and AI platform. So in light of all that, that's why you see the mid-single-digit growth. I think that's prudent, just given what every other consulting competitor has come out with. By the way, that still drives one and a half points of growth to IBM for the full-year. And as I stated earlier, we see an accelerated growth profile as we move through the year.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. Arvind would love to get a little bit more of sort of a macro demand backdrop. I mean, I know Jame mentioned the tightened discretionary spending in some areas. How do you think about the risk of that sort of filtering more broadly as you go through the course of the year, especially given your guidance calls for an accelerating trend here? And if I could quickly, Jame, the synergy is relative to HashiCorp on the cost side. Is there any way you can dimensionalize that given that when you're defining accretion on EBITDA basis, I get that, but can you also help on the net income basis or from a free cash flow, how much it might be diluted in year one and accreted in year two? Thank you so much.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks, Amit. So let me address your part about the demand profile globally. So if I look at where we are right now and where we project for the rest of the year, demand is actually quite strong. I would put it as very similar to 2023. This is backed up by IMF GDP estimates, which are now north of 3% for the global business. If I look at it by geography, Japan remains very strong. I think that they're taking this opportunity to refresh the technology across their enterprise and government base. We look at South Asia, extremely strong. Even the Middle East, UAE, Saudi, very strong. Europe has remained consistent to last year. North and South America. So on a geography basis, you're seeing very, very strong demand. Now, interest rates are higher than people were expecting. I think we should acknowledge that.\nThat means you get two effects going on. One, there is even stronger demand for software and infrastructure because people believe technology helps you in those environments and helps in an environment of increased labor costs and increased supply chain costs. Then when you look at the discretionary side, Jame answered this in the previous question, we are seeing a little bit, not across the board, not in all of the offerings in consulting, but where there is a little bit of discretionary labor, that is where we sense that pressure. What we are going to do is pivot into the areas around helping people become more productive, take more cost out, digital transformation, work with our partners where there is very strong demand in the market. As you pivot there, we believe that our growth rate in consulting will continue to accelerate.\nSo I hope, Wamsi, that that gave you a flavor on the demand vectors we have, both in software and infrastructure, and in consulting, and on a geography basis. Jame, over to you for part two.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As Arvind indicated in preparatory remarks, we couldn't be more excited about the powerful combination of HashiCorp with IBM and Red Hat together. We talked about in the preparatory remarks, we've been very disciplined in our set of criteria around M&A. And this fits strategically. It has tremendous synergistic value to our hybrid cloud and AI portfolio, and it has an attractive financial return overall. And Hashi meets all three. One, it's a higher revenue growth profile company, so it accelerates IBM's revenue growth over time. Two, to your question, adjusted EBITDA accretive in the first 12 months.\nAnd three, levered free cash flow accretive by the end of year two. We think there are a potential for meaningful synergies overall. And when we look at it, significant near-term operating efficiencies, cost synergies, and put that in perspective, we see this business profile moving from about a mid-single-digit free cash flow margin business to about a 30%-40% free cash flow margin business in a handful of years. Free cash flow accretive by the end of year two. Now, the multiple we paid on that, fully supported by one, the standalone revenue growth and the cost synergies that come out. All of the IBM revenue synergies around Red Hat, around data security, around watsonx, around consulting, and IT automation are all upside potential. So let's talk and conclude on the cost synergy. Cost synergies are where you would fully expect.\nIBM runs a global operations in 175 countries. We run a very disciplined G&A efficient structure. We see significant G&A operating efficiencies that we're going to go capitalize on. Second, running the playbook on how we expanded globally our go-to-market model that we did with Red Hat. And that has both global incumbency, global scale, global breadth, and ecosystem leverage overall. And when you look at that, those significant synergies allow us to invest in product R&D, innovation, and capability that's built into our case and also deliver our financial return. So we feel pretty good about it.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please state your question.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nYes. Thank you and good afternoon. Jame, just to clarify, you've taken down your consulting outlook for the year from 6-8-5. I think that's about 60 basis points to company growth. Is there anything offsetting that, or is that just kind of rounding error in the low single-digit guidance? And then my question is, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on the AI book of business, maybe just help clarify exactly how you define that. I think it's both revenue recognized and your bookings and maybe partner bookings. Maybe you could just help define that. And last quarter, you said it doubled sequentially. This quarter, you just commented that it grew sequentially. Maybe you could add a little color with that: double digits or 20%, 30%, or 40%.\nAt least when I do the math, it sounds like it's less than 5% of your consulting backlog, AI backlog. Could you help to mention that as well? Thank you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay, Toni. Many questions here. Let me see if I can get through them quick. You look at full year. Full year, as Arvind indicated, we're maintaining our guidance on our model, mid-single digit. I think prudently, just coming out of a first quarter, we got a lot of work to do in the next three quarters, but I think prudently at the low end of that model. And by the way, that was very consistent with what we said 90 days ago. Now, let's unpack that. When you take a look at full-year, first of all, we are dealing with a stronger U.S. dollar. So we've given you a supplemental chart. Now, we've lost basically about a point more of headwind on currency. But let's talk about the underlying fundamentals of our business across our segments because I think that's at the heart of your question.\nWhen you take a look at our growth at mid-single digits, one, we said software would grow slightly above the high end of our mid-single digit model. We are very pleased with our software performance in Q1. We've accelerated growth from Q4 to 6% overall. We have a very strong recurring revenue base. We accelerated Red Hat to a very strong 9% with our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens booking growth, which positions our business extremely well for double-digit growth for the full-year. We're getting nice scale leverage on acquisitions. Software for the year will deliver over three points of that IBM mid-single digit by itself based on that Red Hat momentum, acquisitions, solid recurring revenue, TP—by the way, nice start, up 4%—and new innovation like watsonx.\nConsulting, we said for the full year, appropriately in light of the market and still gaining share, would be mid-single digits. That will deliver about a point and a half of growth to IBM. Why did we feel good about that? One, solid book to bill, winning in key focus areas, strategic partnerships, and GenAI scale overall. But like Q1, we're going to continue to monitor that backlog realization to see how that plays out. But between software and consulting, over three points in software, about a point and a half. Now you get to infrastructure. We started out well above what we expected here in Q1. Mainframe, eighth quarter in, grew 5%. Our distributed infrastructure, power and storage, both grew double digits as we're capitalizing on distributed infrastructure and demand requirements for GenAI.\nFull year, that's a little bit better than what we thought 90 days ago off our first start. So we expect about a little bit less than a half a point impact to IBM. You throw on top of that, we executed the closure of The Weather Company. That'd be about a half a point. So that's kind of how we build up our full year overall. So AI book of business, I think you nailed it in your question. It's one on a consulting perspective. It's our signings book of business overall. And on our software, it's our subscription, our SaaS, and perpetual licenses. Again, as you know, we offer clients flexibility on how they want to purchase that overall. And consulting backlog, yes, 5% overall. I would tell you, let's put it in perspective.\nIt's probably mid to high single digits, but we've got, give or take, about a $30 billion book of business on backlog with consulting. So coming from where we started less than nine months ago, I think that's a very good ramp. And let's put it in perspective. When we drove the hybrid cloud platform-centric play with consulting, which has done extremely well, over the first four quarters, we did a billion-dollar book of business. Right now, through less than three quarters, we're very damn close to that billion-dollar book of business. So.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask about Red Hat. You accelerated it to 9% in the quarter from 7%. What is your confidence level you get to the mid-teens, which kind of equals your bookings growth? And then on Red Hat, the follow-up would be, how much can HashiCorp augment that growth rate? And can you clarify the synergies a little bit more between Red Hat and Hashi? And was Hashi needed to help grow Red Hat, or is it a bonus? How do you see that? Thanks very much.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nBen, let me take the first part of those questions. We are very, very pleased with Red Hat. If I look at Red Hat now, we have had mid-teens or better bookings growth for the last three quarters, third quarter, fourth quarter, and first quarter. That, combined with the growth we are seeing in OpenShift as well as in both Ansible and RHEL, OpenShift growing almost 40%, gives us a lot of confidence. So bookings growth plus OpenShift plus what we're seeing in the revenue now at 9% tells us that we should see that Red Hat growth continue or accelerate through the year. Two, let me just address a macro point. Hashi is a nice add for the Red Hat portfolio, but it's not inside Red Hat. Let's just be clear.\nSo when we talk about Red Hat growth numbers of nine and accelerating, that is Red Hat as is. Hashi will be measured in software, but in IBM software, not in Red Hat. Where the synergy comes is we believe there will be added demand because of a combined portfolio, is more interesting. We think even more clients will talk to us. That is how Hashi will help Red Hat. It's not that the Hashi revenue counts at all for the numbers we just mentioned. So we kind of want to be clear on that. Hashi, to us, is an accelerant for IBM strategy and for software strategy. And Hashi helps in being offensive in terms of giving us an overall better portfolio so even more clients want to do business with us in the environments they're going to. That's kind of how I would pitch it.\nPeople know Hashi really well for their infrastructure management, but the security pieces of Hashi are also very, very interesting and really important as people navigate these very complex environments with all the worries about people losing secrets and keys, and that resulting in ransomware or hacking attacks. That's kind of how I would paint the picture on that side.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah. I would just add one other point, Ben, as you and I and many of the investors have talked about since Q1 earnings. We've kind of bifurcated this business when we saw the slowdown happen in H2 last year between our subscription-based business within Red Hat versus our consumption-based services and offerings, the former being about 80% of our portfolio, the latter being about 20%. If you look at Q1, as Arvind indicated, we're very pleased.\nComing off of a 2-plus point acceleration positions us extremely well and even more confident in that double-digit for the year. But the reason why we're even more confident is that 80% of that portfolio, that subscription business, we accelerated three points quarter to quarter in revenue, and we were above double digits. On the consumption base, we finally saw stabilization. We didn't see acceleration. We saw stabilization. But remember, we start lapping on that in the second half. So that provides us a tailwind on the second half. But our subscription business today, the 80%, three points acceleration, double-digit in Q1, all three major lines, broad-based, double-digit bookings, Red Hat OpenShift over 40% booking strength, $1.3 billion ARR book of business, grown 25 plus percent, Ansible taken share. We feel even more confident, as I said.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Arvind, maybe this one's for you. If we include the Software AG assets and now HashiCorp, I think you spent about $16 billion on acquisitions since your 2021 analyst day. Back then, you talked about kind of having $20 billon-25 billion of M&A firepower you could leverage through 2024. Just curious, as we sit here today, your willingness or desire to go after more M&A for the rest of this year? Would you be willing to go kind of above and beyond that total that you had laid out almost three years ago? And just as we think about the potential targets in the future, where do you believe you have gaps that you can still fill within your portfolio? Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nEric, let me just maybe address some macro points in it, and I'll let Jame talk to some of the numbers here. We are going to remain incredibly disciplined on our M&A strategy. We kind of said it, but I just want to repeat. We've got to find things that meet our strategy. We've got to have some synergy opportunities at IBM, and it has to be financially accretive within the second-year. So if we find things that meet that and we are committed, I'll say, to both our dividend and our investment-grade ratings, then that is kind of the picture we go in. Now, within that, we believe we have some level of flexibility, and that is what we will operate in. So that gives you a sense there. By the way, one-year, but these two yet to come.\nWe've got Software AG that we hope to close mid-year and HashiCorp, which will come near the end of the year. We also have to look at what is our overall internal dynamics of making sure that we can succeed on these businesses as we proceed down the path. We need to build consulting practices. We need to have synergy plays in other parts of the portfolio. We have to enable our sales teams globally. As we say, a big part of our synergy is getting the amplification from our global footprint that is there with clients all around the world. Jame?\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah. Arvind, just building on your point. We are very confident in the capital structure of this company. We are committed to maintain a very solid investment-grade balance sheet.\nWe are focused on debt leverage, obviously, but our primary capital allocation is to invest in our business both organically, inorganically, and to maintain the attractive return-to-shareholder program with our dividend policy. So with all that said, just to reaffirm what Arvind indicated, we will remain in the market, prudently evaluating complementary tuck-in opportunities that fit our M&A strategy, and we've got the capability of doing that.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please state your question.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nArvind, on the software business, I mean, even ranging somewhere between 3%-8.9% growth, many have asked. It seems like the overall market's growing faster. What's it going to take to unlock this incredible portfolio you've built to effectively maybe monetize at the rate the industry's growing out? Is there something that's causing friction to unlock that true potential of the software business? Are we just being too focused on the short term? What do you think unlocks that value in getting you to your closer TAM of the growth?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nSo Brent, as you can imagine, we are very, very focused on that question. If I just want to lay out a four-year trajectory, if you'll indulge me for just a minute, we began with a software portfolio that was, let's call it flat, would be a kind way of putting it, about five years ago. We've gone from flat to, as you said, some volatility, but we are now seeing that we can be north of 6% for this-year, whether you want to call that 6.5% or 7%, and we are very confident in that. As we both do organic innovation and as we do M&A, we will find that that number will keep improving year-over-year. And I'm pointing to our very consistent four-year trajectory of having achieved that.\nBy the way, within that, we do find there are a couple of slower-growing pieces, but they're incredibly important to our overall profile, both for incumbency with clients and for the cash flow that they produce. We would never expect our mainframe software, the TPS piece, to be growing in the high single digits or in double digits. So as that mix also changes over time, then we find that we're going to get closer-and-closer, and we do want to, over time, get software to grow above where we are right now. So right now, we are at the upper end of the mid-single-digit model. I think you can conclude what would be the next step we will go at, and then we'll go from there.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian Essex with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan",
    "content2": "Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Another Red Hat one. Maybe Arvind, if you could maybe give us a little bit of sense of what's going on in the pipeline there and whether or not you're seeing a substantial benefit in the Red Hat pipeline from the VMware acquisition, both on the consulting side as well as the software side. Are you seeing a lot of migration, and how much of an opportunity do you think might be there longer term to capture more share of that market?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nBrian, great question. So can we talk to some of the Red Hat dynamics? It's not so much directly related to VMware per se, but clients are all beginning to say they're asking the question, which is the platform they want to bet on for the next 10-20 years on which they will write their applications, deploy them both in their own data centers and on public clouds? We find an incredible amount of interest in that question. And as we have built out the Red Hat portfolio, not just for containers, because many people know OpenShift as a great container platform, but also for virtualization with both container-native virtualization and with the KVM hypervisor, we're finding a lot of interest around those topics.\nThen as we layer in by the end of the year the HashiCorp advantages of managing the infrastructure across all these environments, we do believe that that will be an accelerant to the Red Hat portfolio. So first, RHEL has kind of got its place as the primary place where people want to deploy. OpenShift as a platform for both containers and virtualization. Ansible and HashiCorp for helping increase automation and reduce the complexity. We think all of this plays in. And Brian, I think the best number is the mid-teen bookings growth on the subscription side of the business. That speaks to the demand in terms of not only is there demand, but we are realizing that demand in the book of business that we are getting clients to commit to on Red Hat.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat. Operator, let's take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nDirector Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Thank you so much for taking the question. I think I might try a qualitative version of an earlier question around GenAI. And I think just we see so much of the news feed being around kind of the hype cycle, and obviously growing a billion-dollar book of business shows you monetizing it. Can you just talk about maybe the pain points that enterprises are looking to address when they first come to you or when those consulting relationships start? How much of a plan is in place versus how much they're looking for you to kind of hold their hand in terms of this GenAI journey?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nI think, Matt, that's a great question. So let me maybe take that, and I'll address it from both the consulting side and the software side.\nIf we were 12 months ago, I would say that there was a lot of excitement, and there was a lot of experimentation that was starting, and people were not thinking through what does this mean for my overall ROI. What are the economics of running GenAI? How do I get the people changes done so that the ROI can actually be realized? What is happening in all of my conversations this-year in Q1 2024 is a lot of people have woken up that those issues need to be addressed as well. So when they talk to our consulting team, they are spending energy on but can you help my people also do the transformation it takes. What is the change process through which you can recognize those things? They then go to immediately asking, in these models, how expensive is it to run them?\nThey begin to do the math. Wait, if I run this model just for this one business process, the infrastructure cost alone could be $300 million a year. That doesn't close the ROI. Can I do it in a much more cost-effective way, but at an equally good answer? And that is where you begin to see some of the models that IBM has produced, our Granite series, play very strongly into helping them recognize their ROI by reducing the economics. And then lastly, and this is advice that I give to the C-suite usually, and it resonates, is don't pick lots of little experiments. Try to pick a few use cases which can scale.\nBy scale, meaning that they actually do impact a large fraction of the employees or their clients, customers, and they begin to have a large impact in how business is done by either improving revenue or by making the enterprise significantly more productive. That's kind of a conversation shift from simply, oh, this is a neat new tool. Let me try it out to see what I can do, not what I should do, but what I can do. I think that that is a big change in terms of helping the organization scale. So let me now wrap up the call. In Q1 2024, we have executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation, allowing us to invest organically and through strategic acquisitions like HashiCorp. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us.\nI look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Arvind. Operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you all for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us. We had a solid close to 2023 with growth across our businesses and strong cash generation. Our Q4 and full-year results demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and sustainability of our revenue growth. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2023, delivering revenue growth of 3% and over $11 billion of free cash flow. 2/3 of the way through our midterm model, I am proud of our achievements. Since 2021, we delivered average revenue growth for IBM and for each segment at or above our model. The overall trends we are seeing reinforce our views of the future. We are confident in achieving our midterm revenue model, and the strength of our diversified business model allows us to make progress each quarter. We entered the year intent on enhancing our software portfolio and strengthening our consulting position. We have done both.\nMid last year, we launched watsonx, our flagship AI and data platform, and we are excited by the traction we are seeing. Consulting has delivered durable revenue growth through the year despite an uneven macro environment. Our expanding ecosystem, skills, and technical expertise, global reach, and co-creation approach not only set us apart but also contributed to our consulting performance outpacing that of our competitors. This year also underscored the enduring nature and relevance of our zSystem platform. Before getting into the execution of our strategy, I'll make a few comments about what we see in the current environment. I expect many macro trends to be similar to 2023. Technology demand will continue to be strong and serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth. It allows businesses to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies, and seize new market opportunities.\nEvery client I speak with is asking about how to boost productivity with AI and how to manage their technology stack, much of which is deployed across a hybrid environment: public, private, and on-premises. These trends continue to fuel demand for both hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy, starting with AI. Our approach to AI for business is resonating. Earlier in 2023, we introduced watsonx, IBM's core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate, and deploy AI models. We believe AI will be multimodal, with our clients leveraging a combination of models: IBM's, open-source, their own proprietary models, and those of other companies. Flexibility of deployment is key. Simply put, we meet clients where they are and allow clients to deploy AI models across multiple environments.\nIn Q4, we released watsonx.governance to help clients and partners govern and instill trust in generative AI. This toolkit helps organizations manage and monitor their AI and prepare for compliance with future AI-related regulations. IBM was recently named the leader in generative AI for governance platforms by IDC. As I have mentioned before, IBM was one of the first companies to announce the indemnification of all our models. Additionally, IBM and Meta announced in December the formation of the AI Alliance, a group of 70 industry and academic leaders joining together to advance open, safe, and responsible AI. We continue to believe our consulting business will be an early beneficiary of AI. We are the only provider today that offers both a technology stack with our watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI.\nThe early work for clients around data architecture, security, and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful practice around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are on a similar trajectory with generative AI. Consulting is a core driver of our value proposition for clients. Last quarter, I shared with you that our book of business in the Q3, specifically related to generative AI and watsonx, was in the low hundreds of millions. Since then, demand continues to increase, and our book of business in the Q4 is roughly double that Q3 amount. We continue to have thousands of hands-on client interactions, including an acceleration in pilots that were completed during the quarter.\nSoftware transactional revenue and SaaS ACV was approximately 1/3 of our book of business related to generative AI in the Q4, and 2/3 was consulting signings. There was a balance of both large and small transactions across both segments. Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service, and digital labor continue to offer meaningful near-term benefits to clients. We've been collaborating with numerous clients using watsonx Code Assistant for Ansible. This includes a successful pilot with Citi, where initial results point to substantial developer productivity and code quality improvements that have led to plans for a rapid expansion focused on scaling for enterprise-wide outcomes. This is just one of many examples. In other industries, we have done work with clients such as NatWest, Lockheed Martin, and Boehringer Ingelheim.\nWe are working on an interesting use case with the Sevilla Fútbol Club using watsonx to find the right players to sign by describing attributes across the database of more than 200,000 scouting reports. As clients build out their AI strategies and focus on driving ROI and productivity, the importance of optimizing IT spend and consumption is magnified. Apptio, our virtual command center for managing technology investments, comes up in nearly all of my client discussions. The value proposition is clearly resonating. Looking beyond AI, we had a number of important client wins in the Q4. For example, we're helping NATO strengthen their cybersecurity posture and build out a customized solution to have greater visibility into cyber threats and respond to them more quickly. We are working with Riyadh Air to help them drive their digital and technology strategy and establish their hybrid cloud integration platform.\nWe also saw meaningful consulting renewals, which, combined with new wins, highlight the focus and unique strengths of our capabilities. Our strategic partnerships with companies such as SAP, AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Adobe continue to expand and thrive. For instance, we are working together with Adobe to embed watsonx into their platform. We also continue to deepen our partnership with SAP through further collaboration across watsonx and Quantum. We also have several new watsonx ISV partners. What we see is clear. Many ISVs are eager to work with us as a trusted provider that understands enterprise needs. We continue to invest and bring new innovations to the market in other areas as well. In the quarter, Red Hat enhanced its Ansible automation platform, introducing new offerings like Ansible Lightspeed and Event Driven Ansible.\nWe announced the availability of Red Hat Device Edge to manage your workloads and deliver automation at the edge. In quantum computing, we introduced Heron, the most advanced quantum processor, and the System Two, a modular quantum computer. Focusing our portfolio remains a key priority. We completed nine acquisitions this year, including Apptio, and we recently announced the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG, which we expect to close mid-year. With respect to divestitures, we announced the sale of our weather assets, which we expect to close in Q1. We also announced the Enterprise AI Venture Fund, a $500 million fund, with the goal of partnering with the startup community to tap into the latest AI innovations in the market and help them scale.\nIn summary, I believe that the changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years position us for the evolving technology landscape. As I reflect on our performance since we presented our midterm model in October of 2021, I am pleased with the progress we have made internally and with our clients. We have delivered average revenue growth for IBM in line with our midterm model, and this is true for all our segments. Software has delivered average growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model.\nConsulting delivered average growth in line with the high single-digit model, and infrastructure is well ahead of expectation. This performance gives me confidence as we move into the new year. For 2024, we expect performance in line with our midterm model, with mid-single-digit revenue growth and about $12 billion of free cash flow. This keeps us firmly on a path of sustainable growth. Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter and our expectations for 2024. Jim, over to you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. In the Q4, we delivered $17.4 billion in revenue, $4.2 billion of operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share of $3.87, and we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow. This wrapped up another solid year where we continue to deliver durable growth in our repositioned business, aligned with client priorities of digital transformation and driving productivity. Taking a step back, let me touch on a full year before I go into additional details of the quarter. Our revenue for the year was nearly $62 billion, up 3%, and in line with our expectation 90 days ago. We generated $10.3 billion of operating pre-tax income and operating earnings per share of $9.62. Our free cash flow was $11.2 billion, our strongest level of cash generation since 2019. Revenue performance for the year was again led by software and consulting.\nSoftware grew by over 5%, with good growth across hybrid platform, solutions, and transaction processing. Consulting revenue was up over 6%, with solid growth every quarter and broad-based growth across all three lines of business, highlighting the durability of our results and differentiated client offerings. Infrastructure was down 4%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Our revenue growth and productivity initiatives led to margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. For the full year, we expanded operating gross profit margin by 130 basis points, with every segment growing margin across every quarter. Our operating pre-tax margin expanded by 40 basis points, in line with our expectations and driven by strong productivity gains, and operating leverage. This includes a 110 basis point headwind from currency dynamics. Now, turning to a deeper dive on the quarter, our revenue was up over 3%. Software revenue was up 2%.\nOur Q4 performance reflects continued growth in our recurring revenue and a wrap on last year's seasonally strong transactional performance. Consulting had another solid quarter with 5.5% revenue growth, which is a sequential improvement in the growth rate. We had good signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio over 1.15. This continued momentum in consulting is reflective of how we work with clients, the investment we are making in skills and talent, velocity in our strategic partnerships, and our integrated value proposition. We had great infrastructure performance this quarter. Revenue was up 2%, with growth in both zSystem and distributed infrastructure. This performance is particularly notable given it's the seventh quarter of the z16 cycle, and on our seasonally largest quarter, again highlighting the innovation we are bringing to this mission-critical platform.\nLooking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 140 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 110 basis points, inclusive of a 150 basis point currency headwind to pre-tax margin. Currency impacted operating pre-tax profit growth in the quarter by over $200 million. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives, which allowed for continued investments to drive innovation in our portfolio. You can see this in our higher R&D expense. Our operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year, and our operating earnings per share of $3.87 was up 8%. We remain laser-focused on our productivity initiatives as we digitally transform our business processes and scale AI within IBM.\nThis includes simplifying our application and infrastructure environments, streamlining our supply chain, aligning our teams by workflow, reducing our real estate footprint, and enabling a higher value-added workforce through automation and AI-driven efficiencies. Against a target of $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024, which I mentioned back in April of last year, we have already achieved over $1.5 billion. Our productivity initiatives have allowed us to increase our investments in innovation, technical and industry skills, and go-to-market capabilities, including our ecosystem. We have accomplished this while simultaneously growing our profit margin and free cash flow, which in turn has increased our financial flexibility. This remains our playbook going forward, and given our success to date, we now believe we can achieve at least $3 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024.\nOverall, the combination of our revenue and margin performance resulted in 9% growth in our operating pre-tax profit for the quarter. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the year, we generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow, up $1.9 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this growth comes from $900 million of adjusted EBITDA. For better transparency, we have included a view of our adjusted EBITDA performance in our supplemental slides. Our free cash flow growth also reflects benefits of about $400 million from working capital efficiencies, which is consistent with what we've been suggesting throughout the year. CapEx was also down about $400 million, reflecting actions to optimize our real estate portfolio. These actions reduced our net CapEx, although had limited benefit to our profit performance.\nIn terms of cash uses for the year, we invested over $5 billion to acquire nine companies, and we returned just over $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with a strong liquidity position, with cash of $13.5 billion, which is up $4.6 billion year-over-year. Total debt is up $5.6 billion over the same period, and our debt balance ended the year at $56.5 billion, including approximately $12 billion of debt associated with our financing business. Our retirement-related plans remain in a strong financial position. At year-end, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are funded at 111%, with the US at 123%. Turning to our segments, software grew 2%, with growth across both hybrid platform and solutions, and transaction processing. This quarter's performance again reflects growth in our high-value recurring revenue base, which is up mid-single digits.\nI'll remind you this comprises about 80% of our annual software revenue. Transaction processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms like zSystems. This, together with price increases, contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in transaction processing for the year. Hybrid platform and solutions revenue was up 1%. Within this performance, Red Hat revenue was up 7%, automation was flat, data and AI was up 1%, and security declined. Looking across hybrid platform and solutions, the strength of our recurring base of business is evident in our ARR, now $14.4 billion and up over 7% since last year.\nWe also faced a tough compare here in the Q4, wrapping on seasonally strong transactional performance, including strength in ELAs, as we discussed at the start of the year. What played out in the Q4 reflects just these dynamics, and while transactional revenue overall was significant, it was down year to year a little more than expected. In Red Hat, revenue performance was similar to last quarter, as we continue to see dampening growth in consumption-based services. Our future growth indicators are encouraging. Red Hat annual bookings were up 17%, including double-digit bookings growth across all three key offerings: RHEL, OpenShift, and Ansible. Renewals have been strong this quarter, with our NRR up well over 100% and up six points over last year. OpenShift continued its strong performance, with annual recurring revenue of $1.2 billion. Beyond OpenShift, our platform-based approach is resonating with clients.\nWe're seeing growing interest in our generative AI platform, watsonx, as Arvind touched on earlier. We've been investing to both extend and expand our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities and software, from new offerings in Ansible to the launch of watsonx.governance to the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods. Looking at software profit, gross profit margin expanded, and pre-tax margin was flat, with the latter reflecting key investments in innovation and about 2 points of currency impact in the quarter. In consulting, our revenue in the quarter was up 5.5%. We continue to see solid demand for data and technology transformation projects, with a focus on AI and analytics. Clients are also prioritizing cloud modernization and cloud-based application development projects. This focus on digital transformation and AI initiatives to drive productivity and cost savings has been consistent throughout the year.\nOur ability to address these client demands drove signings growth of 8%, with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter. That caps off a solid year where signings grew at a high teens rate, and with this, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. There has been significant interest this year regarding our consulting outperformance relative to competitors. Let me give you my thoughts on what differentiates us: our integrated value, investments in skills and strategic partnerships, and focused execution. First, we are the only technology company with a consulting business at scale. This unique integrated value proposition helps our clients implement digital transformations and generative AI solutions. Second, we reposition our portfolio to address our clients' top priorities through investments in skills, capabilities, and strategic partnerships. Consulting is even more powerful when working in collaboration with our partners.\nOur strategic partnerships now make up over 40% of our consulting revenue and deliver double-digit growth in both signings and revenue for the full year. Within this performance, our AWS and Azure practices each grew revenue more than 50% for the year. Finally, our solid results throughout the year demonstrate our focus on execution. When you look at our three lines of business in consulting, we have consistently delivered solid revenue performance. Business transformation revenue grew 5% for the third consecutive quarter, again led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to growth. Technology consulting revenue was up over 4%, with growth in cloud modernization projects and cloud-based application development. Application operations revenue grew 6%, driven again by cloud application management and platform engineering services, with both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements contributing to growth.\nMoving to consulting profit, we expanded gross margin 30 basis points and delivered pre-tax margin of 11.5%, which is up 50 basis points year to year. Our pre-tax margin performance continues to reflect the pricing and productivity actions we have taken, offsetting increased labor costs and nearly a point of currency impact. In our infrastructure business, revenue was up 2%. Hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 7%, and infrastructure support declined 9%. Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystem revenue was up 8%. Now, seven quarters into the product cycle, z16 revenue performance has significantly outperformed prior cycles, including the successful z15 cycle. The z16 program incorporates a number of key innovations for our clients, including cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe cyber resilience security, energy efficiency, and strong reliability and scalability.\nClients are increasingly leveraging zSystems for more and more workloads, and that translates to demand for more capacity, which we described in terms of MIPS. In fact, installed MIPS have roughly doubled over the last two cycles. Putting this all together, zSystems remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption, but also related software, storage, and services. Distributed infrastructure revenue was up 7%, with growth across both Power and storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10, and storage traction was aligned to the success of the z16 cycle we just mentioned. Infrastructure support revenue declined, given our successful hardware performance. Looking at infrastructure profit, we delivered gross profit and pre-tax margin expansion. Pre-tax margin expanded 280 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing over a point of impact from currency.\nNow, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. As Arvind mentioned, we are now two-thirds of the way through our midterm model, and so I'd say it's a good time to reflect on what we have accomplished over this period. Let me start with the actions we've taken to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. We aligned our business to a platform-centric model focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Our go-to-market is based on more technical and experiential selling. We opened IBM's ecosystem and strategic partnerships to give our clients greater choice and technical depth, and give IBM multiple ways to win across our portfolio. We have invested in innovation and skills, and pursued strategic M&A, and we presented a simplified reporting structure to give increased transparency into our performance.\nThese actions resulted in a fundamentally different company, with an improved business mix and a higher value recurring revenue base. Today, our growth factors of software and consulting represent 75% of our revenue base, up from about 55% in 2020, and our stable recurring revenue stream represents about half of IBM's revenue. As Arvind said, our two-year average revenue growth is in line with our mid-single digit model, and our segments have delivered at or above their revenue models. With this backdrop, let me turn to 2024 guidance and our two key measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. We expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single digit model. As we start the year, I think it's prudent to assume the low end of that model. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion.\nOur revenue expectations are underpinned by solid growth in both software and consulting. In software, given our pipeline of business, investment in innovation, and the contribution of acquisitions, we expect revenue growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single digit model. In consulting, our solid signings and book-to-bill ratio support revenue growth in a range of 6% to 8%, with acceleration throughout the year. Given this growth profile, coupled with our productivity actions, we expect to see well over a point of pre-tax margin expansion in each of these segments. And then in infrastructure, as we are entering the year seven quarters into the z16 cycle, we expect 2024 infrastructure revenue to decline. This should drive over a point impact to IBM's overall revenue growth. And given these z cycle dynamics, we expect infrastructure pre-tax margin to be lower year-over-year.\nBringing it all together, with these segment dynamics, we expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about half a point, consistent with what we delivered in 2023. Our tax rate for the year should also be fairly consistent with 2023, and as always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion in 2024, driven primarily by growth and adjusted EBITDA. We will have lower cash requirements driven by changes in our retirement plans, which will be offset by higher CapEx and other balance sheet dynamics. Let me comment on a couple of items that are included in our guidance. First, we are seeing increased productivity in our business, which will lead to workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with 2023 levels.\nSecond, as we remain focused on portfolio optimization, we expect to close the sale of The Weather Company assets in Q1. On a full-year basis, we expect this to impact revenue growth by over a half a point, and any pre-tax gain from the transaction will be partially offset by foregone profit. In Q1 2024, the company will realign its management structure to manage these assets outside of the software segment within other divested businesses, which will provide comparability within software on a year-over-year basis. Looking into Q1, I'd expect our revenue growth rate to be similar to the full year. For profit, we expect the H1 to H2 skew of net income to be fairly consistent with history, and Q1 to be a couple points better than last year's skew.\nIn summary, we have a durable growth business with strong free cash flow generation. We have made a lot of progress this past year and feel good about our position as we enter 2024. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. As a reminder, supplemental information is provided at the end of this presentation, and please refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. If we look at your cash flow performance, it's really very compelling at $12 billion on your guidance. Jim, could you maybe help us bridge from 2023 to 2024? What are the items that are driving that $12 billion in free cash flow? What's happening with maybe cash taxes within that, working capital, and any other detail that you can help parse out would be great. Thank you so much.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question overall. We're obviously very pleased. The team has executed extremely well in 2023, our strongest free cash flow since 2019, $11.2 billion, up 1.9 billion year to year. I think it's important, to your point, before we get to 2024, to take a step back a year ago and talk about how we guided the year.\nBy the way, we've been consistent every quarter about our guidance of about $10.5 billion. The reason I think it's important is because it goes right at the heart of your question, which is the quality, and sustainability, and why we here at IBM have the confidence in the guide of about $12 billion. We said a year ago, about $10.5 billion; it was predominantly going to be driven by the improving fundamentals of our business, read that sustainable revenue growth, operating leverage, and that, by the way, is our model, $750 million year to year. On top of that, remember, we had an opportunity gap coming out of Q4 2022. We said we would get working capital efficiency of $400 million, and then we would have modest structural action tailwind offsetting modest cash tax headwind.\nThat kind of brought it all together, $750-ish from improving fundamentals of the business, $400 million. Now, how did 2023 play out? Number one, the improving fundamentals of our business, we had a very strong second half, both on our top-line revenue, our portfolio mix, our productivity, and we delivered $900 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA year to year, which, by the way, we gave you as far as increased transparency. On top of that, we got the $400 million worth of working capital efficiency, very consistent. Then we've got, and we capitalized on all of the productivity actions that we have done. We capitalized on being opportunistic on some real estate rationalization. That's why our CapEx was down about $400 million. By the way, full transparency, that's a timing. That was a 2024 item. We got that in 2023, so let's put that aside.\nThen we've got about $100 million worth of cash tax that came in a little bit better. So, I would say against that, very strong, high-quality sustainability. That sets the baseline for 2024. 2024 really is simple, as we said in the prepared remarks. One, we see very consistent growth in the fundamentals of our business around revenue profile, margin, and productivity that we will get a similar level of growth year to year in adjusted EBITDA. By the way, that's above our model, again, as I'll state. So, that we did $900 million last year, we'll get it again. With that, we will also have benefits from the changes in retirement plans that many of you have written about. But offsetting that, we got higher cash taxes year to year, and we've also got CapEx that we are going to continue to invest for the long-term sustainable leadership of this company. It's really, in 2024, entirely driven by the business model of our adjusted EBITDA growth. Thank you again, Wamsi, for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani. Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please state your question.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThanks a lot and good afternoon, everyone. I guess my question is really focused on the software side. When I think about the calendar 2024 guide of, I think, slightly about the mid- to medium-term target that you folks have, can you maybe talk about how do I think about the split between organic versus inorganic in 2024? If you could also perhaps unpack what you expect to see across some of the key segments like Red Hat, which I think was somewhat below your expectations in 2023. And then also the TPP side would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay, Amit, thank you. Let me do some of the financial bridges here over here, then turn it over to Arvind and talk about the portfolio, the competitiveness, the innovation, and why we feel very confident overall. When you look at our guide, by the way, an acceleration from 2023, I would first start with full year last year. We were very pleased with our software performance, over 5% growth year-over-year. And on a two-year CGR against our mid-single digit model, we're at the high end of that model.\nSo when you look at our guide, we feel confident in the level of innovation we've been bringing in, but I would break that guide down mathematically into about three or four different buckets. Number one, I think we've proven over the last two years that we have rebuilt and repositioned our portfolio, and we now have a high-value recurring revenue stream that can grow in this business off of the innovation and the success of our hardware platform business. That's about two points of growth of slightly above the mid-single digit model of software. So two points based on credibility of our sustained growth and the high-value recurring revenue. Number two, you talked about acquisitions. We are going to continue to invest in full investment into our software portfolio to improve the innovation, the synergistic value, the strategic fit, the hybrid cloud, and AI.\nYou saw we closed very excited after a great start with Apptio, and we announced the acquisition of webMethods and StreamSets. Acquisitions will probably give us a little bit less than two points of that growth in 2024. So two points from high-value recurring revenue, a little bit less than two points of acquisition, and then Red Hat, to your point. We actually delivered about what we said in Q4. We said high single digit. We still got impacted by consumption-based services. By the way, we'll start wrapping on that later in 2024, but we're extremely excited about the acceleration in demand in our single-year bookings and our subscription book of business. 14% growth in Q3, 17% growth in Q4.\nRed Hat will give us about two and a half points of growth year-over-year. And then the remaining half a point is our continued growth of our transaction processing, and that's about a half a point. You add those up, you're over 6% growth, and I think we feel pretty good. But let me turn it over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Jim. And the second part of that is all of the innovation that we are delivering. When we stack it up against the demands in the marketplace, our AI platform is going to be a part of what fuels innovation. And as I think you all understand, when people like one part of the portfolio, they tend to also leverage other parts of the portfolio.\nOther than the AI portfolio, automation, which really helps our clients with productivity, Jim mentioned Apptio, but Apptio Turbonomic, the whole category called AIOps in the market, we believe is going to be a big driver of demand for us. On the mainframe, let's remember, TP does get driven by increased MIPS, and Jim talked about the increased MIPS that are out there. Those MIPS, coupled with the innovation we do in that part of the portfolio, drive the growth. So it's very well balanced. You have M&A, you have Red Hat innovation, you have AI innovation, automation innovation, and TP innovation. And that is really what comes together to give us that growth and give us the confidence of being able to deliver all of that growth.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThe next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please state your question.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYes, thank you. I have one clarification and one question, please. So just on the free cash flow, Jim, I'm wondering, can you give us a bridge from net income, which I think the street is expecting is about $9 billion or a little over for fiscal 2024, and how you get to $12 billion in free cash flow, not from 2023 levels, but from net income levels? And maybe in that, can you just clarify how much do you expect depreciation expense to be, and how much do you expect CapEx to be, and how big a contributor is that?\nThen secondly, on the AI book of business, I think you said low hundreds of millions that doubled. Should we be thinking $300 to 400 million? And it sounds like a third was in software. Was that revenue recognized during the quarter? And then the other couple hundred millions were consulting signings. Can you just elaborate specifically on exactly what the book of business means? Thank you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay, Toni, let me take the first piece, and I appreciate the question as always, and then Arvind can talk about the AI overall. For increased transparency, by the way, coming out of Q3, where we delivered free cash flow a billion dollars up year-over-year, Arvind, I, and many other senior leaders, we've spent a tremendous amount of time with our investors. Our investors were actually guiding us, coaching us around giving increased transparency about the drivers right at the heart of your question. That's why we put in both the press release and in the supplemental earnings chart a bridge down from operating pre-tax income down to adjusted PTI. Why?\nAs I stated in Wamsi's question for depicting the quality and sustainability of our free cash flow. So when you look at 2024, so to your point, I'll leave 2023 aside. When you look at 2024, it's entirely going to be driven, and more, by the growth in adjusted EBITDA. And when you look at net income and you break it down, there's not that much difference between net income overall and the adjusted EBITDA overall. So the $900 million is purely a function of the confidence we have in the portfolio, the mix, the scale, the operating leverage, and the productivity, which you heard on the prepared remarks; we took up the $3 billion here as an annual exit run rate by the end of 2024. So it's an entirely driven balance sheet. We'll have dynamics going one way or the other, cash tax, modest headwind, but those all kind of wash out. It's going to be entirely driven by the business fundamentals.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Jim. So Toni, on the AI book of business, this is not all revenue in the quarter. I should just begin with that statement to set it straight. At this stage, we wanted to start looking at what is our momentum, what is the sentiment from our clients. So we went to a measure that is more reflective of, I'll use the word signings. What is the commitment the clients are making to us? Consulting is straightforward. It is the signings. Consulting signings are anywhere from 12 to 24 months on average, is how much time they play out over. And on software, it's what they're committing to.\nAnd we are using SaaS ACV, so it's a 12-month commitment, which is typical for as a service, as well as since we do offer our portfolio both ways as license or as a service, it includes the license piece as well. Now, over a long term, let's call it a couple of years or more, yes, the book of business should turn into an amount of revenue in a quarter, but that's going to take a bit of time to catch up. But we felt that this gave the better indicator right now of what is our traction and what is our acceleration in that part of the business.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, great. Hey, thanks a lot. Wanted to ask about consulting. Jim, you mentioned and disclosed high-teen bookings growth in 2023 and just did 8% off a pretty difficult comp. I was wondering how that's going to play out in terms of revenue yield in 2024 and into 2025. Does that give you more confidence that the second half of 2024 is going to have a pickup in consulting revenue reported? And then for Arvind, if I could just sneak more on consulting, one of your top competitors, your top competitor has much easier comps in terms of bookings and revenue over the next 12 months. Do you think you can continue to outperform them in the next year? Thanks.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Ben. Really appreciate the question. I'm glad it's a consulting-based question. I think the team is executing extremely well in the marketplace. As we talked about in prepared remarks, there's real synergistic value of consulting in a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. I think you've seen that play out. When you look at it, yes, we had a very strong year, relatively speaking, in the marketplace around consulting in 2023. Signings growth 17%, book-to-bill over 1.15. Our absolute backlog is up 8%, the strongest we've had in quite some time. By the way, stable erosion and duration is up slightly, which we expect as clients do more and more application modernization. Those are long tails. So when you look at that profile and you look at how we enter 2024, we take a look at that backlog. We do our backlog runouts.\nWe look at how much of that comes out of our waterfall of the backlog realization and how much actual sell and bill activity you got to do in the year. That gives us confidence. We guided full year to 6% to 8%. We also said that we expect, just based on those backlog realization trends, albeit a lot of work still to get done in 2024, but based on those backlog realization trends, we see an acceleration growth path throughout 2024. That tail end into 2025, we're well in front of our skis now. But when you just look at backlog, and by the way, backlog, when you look at 2025, the predictor indicator is only about 1/3 of that backlog sits in 2025. As we enter right now in 2024, about 2/3 is backlog driven.\nThat still looks like pretty healthy growth compared to what our model looks like. So we feel pretty good about our book of business and the strategic partnership velocity, the Red Hat velocity. So I would leave it at that. Let me turn it over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Jim. So Ben, as a follow-up directly compared with one other or two other people, can I take it back to the market if you don't mind? The overall consulting market seems to be in the 4% to 6% range. So we benchmark there to make sure that we're trying to take share and that we have the offerings which appeal to clients, which also allow us to keep a healthy margin in the business.\nSo when we look at it from those two lenses, we are going to be absolutely focused on taking share, which is why we are guiding to a higher 6% to 8% number, is where we feel it'll be. Then we go back to, do we have the bookings that justify that? Yes, the bookings justify it. But as you all know, that is some, but not all, of the revenue in the year. So we feel it's prudent to then guide it into the 6% to 8%, not higher. So you combine it with the offerings we have. We are also very, very focused compared to many of the players out there who are much larger. We are very focused on our strategic partners, and we are very focused on digital transformation, data, and AI, as opposed to a much broader swath of offerings that other people have. That gives us confidence in our growth rate, as Jim pointed out, for our consulting business.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nLet's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please state your question.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader and Internet Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks, Arvind. I'm just curious if you could just give us your view of the business climate, just how things are feeling in the last quarter versus quarters before. We're continuing to hear of a downturn in some of these software budgets from CIOs. And I'm just curious if you're hearing and seeing the same thing that we're seeing in our work.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah, Brent. So let me address that. I'll begin by saying I see 2024 playing out quite similar to 2023. While there has been a lot of talk about reduced software budgets and reduced technology budgets overall, we are not seeing that. We are seeing that people are a bit more discriminating in what they're spending on, but that is as they're spending more on AI, more on digital transformation, and I'll come to why; it might mean that they are sort of focusing less on some other areas. So why is that? We see that there is a remarkably resilient economy.\nWe can see that across South Asia, from India to Japan to the Middle East. Europe has kept remarkably resilient despite the conflict in Eastern Europe. Then when we come to North America, the economy here is resilient. Latin America, despite some early predictions, has actually done quite well. You put that all together; look, we don't forecast GDP. We just look at what other people forecast, and all of them are forecasting in the 2% range, 2%, 2.3%, same difference from our perspective.\nThen if you look at some of the pressures our CEO clients face, whether it's interest rates, whether it's inflation, whether it's supply chain, whether it's the demographic shifts on population, whether it's geopolitical conflicts or uncertainty, one answer that lets them grow without taking on fixed costs of either labor or physical infrastructure is technology. So we see every one of them leaning into technology as a potential answer that helps them against all of those potential headwinds. And so we feel pretty good that technology budgets should stay in line with 2023 going into 2024.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nLet's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the software results a bit. That was if we maybe set aside Red Hat, which we've spoken about. Some of the other businesses continue to decelerate, especially looking at something like data and AI or automation, especially in this climate of AI and a focus on spending there. I'm just curious: what is driving the confidence that those businesses reaccelerate? Is it customer conversations? I'd love if you could just give a bit more detail, one, on, again, what happened in Q4 and kind of how you parse through some of that deceleration across those businesses. And then two, again, what's underscoring the confidence that some of these businesses then reaccelerate into next year? Thanks so much.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nI'll take that. Jim, let's start with the bigger picture. Overall, we laid out a midterm model. We set our software portfolio, which grows mid-single digits. By the way, coming from a prior cycle that we were very low single digits overall. We finished this year up over 5%. We finished a two-year CGR already 2/3 into our model at the high end of the model at 6%. Is that our aspiration? Absolutely not, is what Arvind has the entire team focused on. That's why we continue to fuel investment into new innovation, both organically and organically. Let's take a step back how we set the year up. We set the year up. We said the year was going to be predominantly driven by the strength of our recurring revenue annuity portfolio, which, by the way, high value, 80% of our software revenue. That's our subscription-based models, our SaaS models, our TP software, etc. We said that was going to grow mid-single digit. We actually delivered on that.\nWe said then, second, prudently coming off of a peak ELA cycle, and you understand our ELA cycle extremely well in Q4 2022, that we expected a headwind. Now, let's go back 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we were sitting year to date, 6.5% total software segment, which gave us the confidence of taking up our guidance to the high end of the mid-single digit model. What was driving that? Both HPNS was up 7%, TP was up 6%. And underneath that, we were seeing very solid growth in our transactional business, both volume and NRR with new clients. Now we get the Q4 and the ELA wrap hit us. By the way, the ELA cycles, give or take, they're in these ranges. They're on average about three years. They get probably somewhere around 40% to 50% plus in year one, and then it tails off.\nSo it's the biggest impact we'll see. We got through that in the Q4, and we still delivered over 5%. And on two-year CGR, we're at the high end of the model. Now, when you look at full-year performance, Red Hat up 9%, automation, I'm directionally correct, 4% or 5%, data and AI, 4% or 5%. Security, yes, we got an execution gap on security. We got an opportunity to go fix in 2024. So I think it's actually glass half full. The innovation we're fueling in organically, the M&A portfolio, which is scaling nicely with a strategic fit, that gives us the confidence on why we're actually taking up and accelerating our growth in light of Brent's question in 2024.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Our next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nDirector of Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thank you guys so much for taking my questions. Congratulations on both the free cash flow and then also, obviously, the free cash flow going into next year. Maybe focusing even more so on the software side and just thinking solely on that 2.5 points of growth that's expected to come from the Red Hat. I mean, you've talked about the consulting strength that you're hearing around both cloud and application modernization. Are there any other signs you're hearing specifically from pipeline or customer conversations about an improving demand environment for Red Hat specifically? And then maybe just as a caveat, how maybe some of the cloud cost optimizations impacted Red Hat in 2023?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah. Matt, let me take that. So when we look at Red Hat, while there are many products in the portfolio, three are the bulks that drive the forward performance. So, Red Hat Linux, as we look at the overall usage of Linux, as we look at customers being even more concerned about patching, security, and making sure that hackers can't break into their infrastructure. And we look at the sheer volatility that happens, I'll call it, in the unfettered open-source world, it drives a lot of demand for Red Hat.\nAnd we're beginning to see not just enterprise customers, but even many ISVs begin to embrace that. As we look at OpenShift, I go back to a fundamental. I think most of our clients have now acknowledged that a hybrid environment is their reality, meaning multiple public clouds and their own data centers are private. In that environment, OpenShift is the leading platform that gives them the flexibility to take an application and run it across all of those.\nIn this day and age, when people have thousands of applications and they want the ability to deploy without having thousands of people, then Ansible gives them the platform to go do that. Those three combined roll up into the 17% increase in bookings that Jim referenced on the call. That's not a leading indicator. That is actually already done. Now, with 14 in the previous quarter, that tells us there's acceleration happening on that side. We feel confident, given the client conversations, that these are all going to lead to Red Hat growth, putting aside the innovation that's coming from the edge platforms, from embedded Red Hat, and from other markets that as the edge opens up will create yet again another additional market that has to come. So this gives us confidence that Red Hat will grow and provide that 2 to 2.5 points for overall software.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOperator, let's take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Maybe for Jim, with regard to acquisitions, could you maybe provide some color or an update on your pipeline and offer maybe an update on your philosophy behind M&A, how you assess transactions with regard to the level of appreciation you might require, what they might contribute to top-line revenue growth, or how they might improve ROIC long-term?\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah, sure. I appreciate that, Brian. Thank you very much. I mean, I think Arvind's been very clear for the last three and a half, four years since he's come on. First of all, let's talk criteria, right? We always get asked, \"Size this, size that.\" Size is not a criteria. It is entirely, and I compliment him and the entire team, very focused on strategic fit to a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. Those targeted areas are always centered around hybrid cloud, data, automation, security, and oh, by the way, both software IP asset and consulting expertise on both sides. So strategic fit. Second, we run this platform-centric model to create a synergistic multiplier effect in our business.\nSo when we look at every single week a set of targeted candidates, we're looking at the synergistic effect because as a CFO, when we deploy $1, we're looking for a multiplier of hardware, software, services on top of that. And then third, financial attractiveness. It has to be high growth, recurring revenue, highly profitable, and free cash flow accretion in a quick period of time.\nThat will vary based on software. It'll vary based on consulting. But I think you're going to continue to see us be opportunistic in the marketplace. We've got the right capital structure. We've got the right financial flexibility. We ended with, what, $13.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel pretty good about our position, and we will capitalize on that to the extent it hits and fits those criteria. So thank you for the question.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThanks, Jim. Let me now wrap up the call. In 2023, we executed on our strategy to deliver sustained revenue growth and cash generation. The changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years and our performance reinforced my confidence as we move into 2024. I look forward to continuing this dialogue through the year. Thank you.\n\nOlympia McNerney\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nDiego, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nThank you for participating on today's call.

All participants are in a listen-only. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, IBM's Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Q3 2023 earnings presentation. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Patricia Murphy, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow to provide additional information to our investors. Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us.\nBefore we start, let me address the.\nOutbreak of war in Israel. We condemn all acts of terrorism.\nWe are also saddened over the loss of innocent lives and join the global.\nCommunity in the hope that peace and.\nSafety can be restored. Let me now turn to our business performance.\nIn Q3, we had solid.\nGrowth across revenue, profit, and free cash.\nFlow while delivering innovations and positioning our business to capture future opportunities.\nOn the broader trends we are seeing in the market.\nTechnology continues to serve as a fundamental.\nSource of competitive advantage.\nBusinesses and governments around the world are.\nLooking for opportunities to address demographic shifts.\nMake the supply chains more resilient and improve sustainability. More recently, geopolitical events and the reality.\nOf how higher for longer add to the growing uncertainty.\nTechnology helps organizations better deal with the.\nMany challenges they face.\nWe see both tailwinds and headwinds to overall spending. Nearly every business we talk to wants.\nTo leverage technology to offer better services.\nScale more quickly and fuel growth without increasing their footprint.\nThis has been driving demand for technologies.\nThat boost productivity and competitiveness like hybrid.\nCloud and artificial intelligence.\nOverall, we believe the tailwinds outweigh the headwinds and technology spend will continue to outpace GDP. In this past quarter we saw good.\nRevenue growth in software and consulting in infrastructure. More than a year into the product.\nCycle, we continue to see good adoption of z16. Our overall growth reflects our ability to.\nHelp clients to leverage data and AI for competitive advantage, automate IT environments, and seamlessly integrate hybrid cloud solutions.\nWe also continue to position our business.\nFor the future, launching new products and offerings, forging and expanding key partnerships, investing in talent and skills, and focusing our portfolio.\nWe have been taking concrete actions to deliver productivity in our own business. All of this results in an IBM that is aligned to our clients' most pressing needs and has a stronger financial profile. Our Q3 results are another proof point.\nTypically at this point I talk about.\nHybrid cloud and the progress we have made.\nHybrid cloud remains vitally important to our.\nClients and to our business.\nGiven the inflection in AI and more.\nSpecifically, generative AI, I want to spend more time today on AI and how we are approaching this opportunity.\nWe believe that generative AI will be.\nMultimodal with clients using a combination of.\nIBM's models, other companies' models, their own.\nProprietary models and open source models.\nThis hybrid approach to AI is similar to the hybrid approach to cloud.\nLet me give you an overview of.\nThe capabilities we have been building our Generative AI Solutions software stack start with Red Hat OpenShift, which serves as a foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment.\nData services help make the data ready for AI. watsonx is a core platform that enables.\nClients to train, tune, validate, and deploy AI models.\nWe are providing models that address specific.\nDomains such as code language and cybersecurity, among others.\nOur AI assistants include the watsonx Code.\nAssistant to augment developers, watsonx Assistant to.\nAugment customer service agents, and watsonx Orchestrate to augment employees.\nThis quarter we introduced new AI capabilities.\nFor our clients and partners.\nWe unveiled Granite, a multi-billion parameter.\nFoundation model on watsonx.ai which excels in both language and code.\nWe also introduced the watsonx Code Assistant. This includes the watsonx Code Assistant for Z to help clients accelerate the modernization.\nOf mainframe code and apps.\nIt's fueled by a 20 billion parameter model and can, as an example, swiftly translate COBOL to Java. There are hundreds of billions of lines.\nOf code written in COBOL, so the opportunity is significant. Looking forward, we plan to launch watsonx.governance before the end of the year that provides governance tools businesses need to mitigate risks and ensure compliance.\nThrough the AI lifecycle. This is a key consideration for clients.\nAs they go beyond early proof of concept into real deployments to bring our AI capabilities to life.\nWe have more than 20,000 data and.\nAI consultants including a Center of Excellence for generative AI. Our teams help clients navigate the AI landscape from crafting a strategy, understanding how.\nAI can be used and deploying AI responsibly. These consultants also provide valuable real time.\nFeedback to our product teams.\nAs in hybrid cloud, our ecosystem across.\nJSIs, ISVs, and hyperscalers play a critical role in bringing generative AI to our clients.\nIn the work we are doing, clear.\nPatterns are emerging in terms of the.\nAI enterprise use cases based on extensive feedback and trials.\nTo date, three have risen to the top. Code, modernization, customer service, and digital labor.\nAll have broad relevance and deliver tangible business benefits. We have also seen this internally as we apply our AI capabilities to areas.\nSuch as client support, HR, IT optimization.\nSource to pay to automate a.\nSignificant portion of tasks and improve the productivity of our people.\nOur book of business in Q3 specifically related to generative AI was.\nIn the $100 million. The interest is larger with thousands of.\nHands-on interactions with our clients.\nThese are across our largest clients and.\nSmaller clients which lays the groundwork for future watsonx opportunities.\nLet me close the discussion on AI.\nBy talking about a couple of client examples. Dun & Bradstreet is leveraging our consulting.\nSoftware capabilities fueled by watsonx to help their clients create proprietary generative AI solutions.\nIBM and EY also just announced a.\nNew solution powered by watsonx Orchestrate to enhance EY's people advisory services.\nWe continue to bring innovations to the market in areas other than AI.\nThis includes new innovations to our industry.\nLeading hybrid cloud platform Red Hat OpenShift.\nWhich was recognized recently by both Gartner.\nForrester as a leader in container management.\nWe completed the acquisition of Apptio, which complements our IT automation capabilities. In quantum, we're making good progress in building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials. In closing, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We launched our generative AI platform and.\nHave good momentum in helping our clients use this important technology.\nWe continue to take portfolio actions to.\nIncrease our focus on hybrid cloud and AI, and we are applying AI within our own business, improving execution speed and unlocking real value.\nAll of this reinforces my confidence in our future. We're executing a strategy that closely resonates with our clients' needs, and this is propelling our business forward three-fourths into the year. We are well positioned to deliver on.\n2023 expectations for both revenue growth and free cash flow. Now to offer you a more detailed view of our results and the rest of 2023, I'll hand it over to Jim.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights of the quarter. We delivered $14.8 billion of revenue, $2.3.\nBillion of operating pre-tax income and.\n$2.2 of operating earnings per share. Through the first three quarters of the.\nYear we generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow.\nReported revenue growth was 4.6%. This includes just over a point of growth from currency translation, which is significant.\nLess than the constant currency rate suggested in July.\nIn fact, currency movements over the last 90 days impacted our Q3 revenue by about $250 million. At constant currency, our revenue was up 3.5%. As is typical, I'll focus the discussion on constant currency.\nArvind talked about clients' priorities in today's environment, which are driving solid growth in our software and consulting offerings.\nI'll remind you, software and consulting are.\nOur two growth factors together make up about three quarters of our revenue base.\nSoftware revenue was up 6% as clients.\nLeverage their data for insights and automate their IT. In a hybrid environment, we had good growth in both hybrid platform and solutions.\nTransaction processing revenue. Our consulting business had another solid quarter.\nWith 5% revenue growth, strong signings performance.\nA book-to-bill ratio greater.\nThan 1.15 over the last year.\nWe are capitalizing on our continued momentum.\nIn the market as we help clients.\nGet value from hybrid cloud and AI, and leverage our strategic partnerships. Our infrastructure revenue was down 3% with.\nGrowth in Z systems. More and more we are seeing clients embrace IBM Z in their hybrid cloud environments, especially in regulated industries.\nThis growth was offset by declines in.\nDistributed infrastructure and infrastructure support.\nIBM's revenue growth, together with the good.\nPortfolio mix and yield from our productivity initiatives generated strong margin, profit, and free cash flow performance.\nOperating gross margin expanded 160 basis points, and operating pre-tax margin expanded 170 basis points. Within that PTI margin, we absorbed a year-to-year currency impact of over 150 basis points. Despite that headwind, our margin expansion was.\nBroad-based with improvements in every business segment.\nDriving efficiency and productivity has always been.\nPart of our operating and financial models.\nThese ongoing productivity initiatives enable reinvestment in the business, increase financial flexibility, and contribute to margin expansion. Our activities range from simplifying our application environment to digitally transforming our business processes.\nBy applying AI at scale, we are.\nAhead of pace to achieve our target of $2 billion in annual run rate.\nSavings by the end of 2024. While there is still more to do.\nI am pleased with our progress, the combination of our revenue and margin.\nPerformance yielded strong profit growth.\nOperating pre-tax profit was up 17% to $2.3 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and over $5 billion year to date.\nBillion year to date, which is up $1 billion versus last year.\nFree cash flow growth through the first three quarters was primarily driven by cash source from our operating profit performance. We also had working capital efficiencies, driven by solid collections. These growth drivers were partially offset by.\nHigher performance-based compensation payments earlier in the year.\nIn terms of cash usage year to date, we spent about $5 billion on.\nAcquisitions and returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends.\nOur resulting cash balance at the end.\nOf September was $11 billion.\nThat's up over $2 billion from year end.\nWith the acquisition of Apptio in the Q3, cash is down over $5 billion from June.\nOur debt balance is now $55 billion, also down from June. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals.\nAre solid with sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion, solid cash generation, and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to.\nSupport our business into the future.\nTurning to the segments, software revenue grew.\n6% with contribution from hybrid platform and solutions, and transaction processing. This performance reflects growth in both our transactional revenue and our recurring revenue base.\nWhich is about 80% of our annual software revenue. Hybrid platform and Solutions revenue was.\nUp 7% with growth across Red Hat, automation, and data and AI as we execute our platform-based approach, the hybrid.\nCloud and AI Red Hat revenue was up 8%.\nWe continue to deliver good growth in OpenShift and Ansible, both gaining share again this quarter. Clients are committing to our hybrid cloud approach, with annual bookings up 14% in the quarter.\nThis includes double-digit growth across [RHEL], OpenShift, and Ansible, partially offset by headwinds in consumption-based services.\nIT and business automation are top client priorities, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity.\nThis quarter our automation revenue grew 13%.\nWith pervasive growth across all business areas, we had strength in AIOps and management, driven by good performance in Instana and Turbonomic.\nApptio as clients look to optimize business outcomes and boost productivity.\nData and AI revenue was up 6%.\nGrowth areas include data fabric and customer care as enterprise clients are both preparing.\nFor adopting generative AI solutions, leveraging watsonx, we also grew in asset.\nWe help enterprises run sustainable operations in supply chain management.\nSecurity revenue declined 3%. We deliver growth in security software driven.\nBy data security, and identity and access management.\nThis was more than offset by declines.\nIn managed security services.\nLooking across these businesses, our hybrid platform.\nSolutions ARR has grown to $14 billion, up 7% since last year.\nIn transaction processing, revenue was up 5%.\nThroughout this year we've been talking about.\nHow the success of the last couple.\nOf Z system cycles is driving demand.\nFor this mission critical software, this together with price increases contributed to.\nYear to date growth in both recurring and transactional software. Revenue in transaction processing moving to profit.\nFor the software segment, we expanded gross and pre-tax margins. Our pre-tax margin was up 120\nBasis points even while absorbing over 2.\nPoints of impact from currency. We continue to deliver operating leverage driven.\nBy our revenue scale and mix this quarter.\nOur consulting revenue was up 5%, with growth across all three lines.\nOf business and geographies with another quarter of strong signings.\nAs I said, our trailing twelve month book-to-bill ratio is now over 1.15. Clients continue to prioritize transformation projects that.\nEnable cost savings and productivity.\nThese results are a proof point that we are well positioned to meet these.\nNeeds in today's complex environment.\nIBM's focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy has become even more of a differentiator as clients' interest in generative AI continues to ramp. We are helping clients understand how AI.\nCan be used to automate tasks, make.\nBetter decisions with speed and improve customer experiences. We made a series of AI announcements.\nOver the last few months, demonstrating continued advancement of our strategic partnerships.\nWe're providing clients with the opportunity to accelerate their transformation and deploy generative AI.\nResponsibly, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners, or a combination.\nToday our strategic partnerships account for about.\n40% of consulting revenue, and have continued to grow double digits across revenue and signings.\nIn aggregate, our hyperscaler partnership revenue was.\nUp over 40%, and signings essentially doubled year to year.\nAdditionally, our Red Hat practice, which helps.\nClients optimize how they build, deploy, and.\nManage applications for a hybrid cloud environment.\nHas continued to grow at a double-digit rate with over $1 billion of signings in the quarter.\nAll of what I just mentioned, from.\nMarket demand to how we're positioned and partnering to our investments to drive growth.\nIs reflected in our overall consulting revenue performance. You can see that play out across our three lines of business. In business transformation, revenue grew 5%, again led by data and technology transformations including.\nAI and analytics, focused projects, finance, and supply chains. Transformations also contributed to growth in technology.\nConsulting revenue was up 1%. Growth in cloud-based application development and.\nModernization work was partially offset by declines in on prem application focused projects.\nIn application operations, revenue grew 7%, driven by both cloud application management and platform engineering services. In platform engineering, we help clients design.\nAn application environment that runs securely and smoothly at scale.\nMoving to consulting profit, we expanded gross.\nMargin 150 basis points.\nPretax margin expanded 40 basis points to just over 10%. Our year-to-year margin performance reflects productivity actions we've taken, mitigated by increased.\nLabor costs and about a point of pre-tax margin impact from currency.\nMoving to the infrastructure segment, revenue was down 3%. Hybrid infrastructure revenue was flat, while infrastructure support declined 7%. Within hybrid infrastructure, Z systems grew 9%.\nIn a seasonally smaller revenue quarter, z16 revenue remains well ahead of prior cycles after six quarters of availability.\nThe program strength reflects both growing enterprise.\nWorkload requirements and the economic value at scale of the platform in traditional processing and Linux consolidation.\nIn fact, install MIPS capacity for Linux.\nOn Z has grown more than fourfold over the last decade.\nClients continue to value the security, resiliency.\nHybrid cloud capabilities of the Z systems platform.\nDistributed infrastructure revenue was down 6% as.\nCompared to strong growth in last year of 21%.\nAs we introduced innovation across storage and.\nPower10 this quarter we had growth.\nIn Power offset by declines in storage. In the Infrastructure segment we had strong.\nGross and pre-tax margin performance.\nPretax margin expanded 350 basis points, reflecting.\nBenefits from portfolio mix with our Z systems performance and productivity, while absorbing over a point of impact from currency.\nNow let me bring it back up to the IBM level to talk about.\nOur expectations before we go to Q&A.\nJust about two years ago, we introduced today's IBM, a more focused business.\nA platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI.\nSince then we've continued to invest organically.\nInorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and our talent base, and drive productivity across our business.\nThe result is a business that addresses today's client needs, a stronger financial profile. Our Q3 performance reinforces this progress with 3.5% revenue growth, gross and pre-tax.\nMargin expansion and strong free cash flow generation.\nNow, with three quarters of the year.\nBehind us, we are holding our full year view of our two primary financial metrics, revenue growth, and free cash flow.\nWe continue to expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5 and free.\nCash flow of about $10.5 billion.\nThat's up $1.2 billion over last year. We've had solid revenue performance all year in our growth vectors of software and consulting.\nWe still expect software revenue growth at the high end of its mid single-digit model, and consulting revenue in the 6% to 8 range. Infrastructure revenue, of course, reflects product cycle dynamics. In total, with one quarter to go, it's prudent to assume the low end of IBM's 3% to 5 range.\nWe are making great progress in our productivity initiatives.\nThe work we are doing to digitally transform our business not only makes us.\nMore nimble by simplifying and streamlining our.\nProcesses and operations, but it also frees up spend for reinvestment, provides financial flexibility, and delivers operating leverage. This contributes to solid margin and free cash flow performance.\nWe continue to expect about half a point of operating pre-tax margin improvement, and we see a mid-teens tax.\nRate for the year. Our free cash flow performance has been driven primarily from our profit performance through the first three quarters. We're up $1 billion year to year.\nWe delivered nearly 50% of our.\nFull year expectation, which is ahead of our historical attainment. While, as always, we are reliant on a seasonally strong Q4, we're on.\nTrack to achieve about $10.5 billion for the year.\nAs I look specifically at the Q4, with the recent currency movements, we now see currency to be neutral to a 1 point headwind to revenue growth.\nThat's nearly $600 million worse than 90 days ago. I'd expect constant currency revenue growth in.\nThe Q4 to be similar to the third. That's despite a tough compare from last year's strong ELA contribution, and in software and the large z16.\nTransactional performance in infrastructure. This demonstrates continued momentum in our underlying business.\nBring it all together.\nWe've clearly got a higher growth, higher.\nValue business with strong cash generation.\nA business well positioned for the future. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Patricia, let's get started.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of this presentation. Second, I'll try this one last time, but I ask you to refrain from multi part questions to allow time for more people to participate. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. To ask a question, please press star one and record your name clearly. If you need to withdraw your question, press star two. Again, to ask a question, please press star one. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nAmit Daryanan\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYep, thanks a lot.\nGood afternoon everyone. I will stick to Patricia's one last time ask one question only room.\nI guess. Arvind, there's a lot of macro concerns.\nOut there, to say the least.\nI'm hoping you could spend a little bit of time just talking about when you talk to your customers.\nI'm sure you engage with a lot of the Fortune 500 companies.\nGiven this macro environment, how are they?\nShifting or prioritizing their IT budget dollars? I fully understand everything you're talking about generative AI and how beneficial it's going to be.\nGiven the macro environment, given the.\nConstrained IT budgets, I guess where are they taking money away from to fund these investments? I'd love to just understand the custom feedback you're getting, and how's the priority changing as you go forward.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nHi Amit.\nThanks for the question, and it's actually wonderful to talk about this.\nGenerative AI.\nJust for me to very quickly reiterate.\nThe use cases we found that our.\nClients were really climbing onto code.\nOn customer service and on, I'll call it, general digital workers, which is productivity in every enterprise function. If you look at code to a person, every one of the clients.\nSaid we don't intend to get rid.\nOf any developers, this allows us to take care of the tech debt that we've accumulated and makes every developer more productive.\nAmit, I'll kind of point out most.\nEnterprises are very quick to realize if you are more productive, that means you have a competitive advantage to your peers. If they have a competitive advantage to their peers, they'll take share without spending more on labor.\nThat's an incredible long-term competitive advantage. When you go to customer service there.\nIs a cost takeout aspect, but it's not 100%. There is probably a 20% to 30.\nIf you can have more calls, more.\nChats answered by AI, that means you can have much more volume with a smaller number of people.\nThere is both. Also, I'll point out to our audience.\nIt does not get tired, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get upset. There is an NPF improvement, you get along with it.\nOn the third one on.\nDigital workers there likely is a small productivity improvement, but I would call it more in the 4%, 5%, 10%, not 20%, 30%, 40%. In the macro headwinds you're mentioning, higher interest rates, tougher to get skilled people, all of the issues around the geopolitical uncertainty that causes some of the concern or might have caused a pause in some other environments.\nThe AI side, and to be candid.\nThe hybrid cloud side offers them a way through that without having to decrease their ambitions for next year.\nI think we are seeing every.\nOne of them play to that.\nI think that these are more fundamental, these are more core processes than.\nSome of the other areas that people were worrying about two or three years ago, when two or three years ago people were worrying a lot about what do I do to keep all our employees happy?\nCan I add up all the tools for that? I think there's much less of a.\nFocus on that area.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we will hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much. I was wondering if you could comment.\nA little further on the Red Hat.\nDeceleration in Q3, Jim, sounded like was driven partly by consumption-based services that were somewhat weaker.\nAre you still expecting Red Hat growth?\nIn that 11% to 13 range for the year?\nCan you unpack some of the software elements in the Q4 between?\nRed Hat, transaction processing, and perhaps Apptio. Thank you so much.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYes, thanks, Wamsi.\nI appreciate the question. Obviously we're very pleased overall with our software segment performance growing 8% actual, 6 at constant currency, really led pretty pervasively with growth across the board. Automation led Red Hat at 8% as you said, and I'll come to that in a second. But data and AI overall really underpinning all that is, like we said, starting the year on a very strong solid recurring revenue base.\nHigh value 80% of that portfolio by.\nThe way, growing mid-single-digit growth. You see that play out in our transaction processing that we call the growth vector and then also our hybrid platform and solution business $14 billion ARR that's growing high-single-digit overall. Now within that you see Red Hat, Red Hat we talked about in the prepared remarks. First of all, Arvind and I would acknowledge we came in a couple points below our expectation and I think that's an execution discussion overall embedded in that. Where did it come from? It came from because I think this is very important. It came from the consumption-based services and offering side of the equation which by the way is about 20% of our portfolio. Shorter duration overall and it went from last quarter high-single-digit, which is about what the model is to low-single-digit overall.\nIf you look at that and compare.\nThat now let's look at the other part of the portfolio, the remaining 80%.\nThat is our subscription-based business, that's.\nOur Red Hat franchise industry market leader. That's Red Hat OpenShift, and that's Ansible. We had a very strong annualized bookings in the quarter, which again, subscription-based business model we talked about all year long, we were going to be back-end loaded on renewals. We grew that mid-teens overall, including services. By the way, if I extract out that 20% portfolio services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19% overall, 110+% NRR on that renewal rate of that business, and within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40% with Red Hat growing double digits. So, putting all that together, I think it's prudent right now when we look at Q4. We're only building into our model again software at the high end of our segment model. We're only building in high single digit.\nWe have to continue to monitor what?\nHappened to us in Q3.\nGet the team focused on execution.\nBut I would tell you, just given the signings growth that we posted in Q3, and by the way, another good pipeline in Q4, we feel very confident in the long-term posture of Red Hat growing double digits.\nWe just got to get through and.\nMonitor what's happening to us on the services side. Thanks very much for the question.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks Wamsi. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYes, thank you for taking the question, Jim. It sounds like your guidance for Q4, given you expect revenues on constant currency to be at the low end, is somewhere around $17.3 billion, which is quite a bit below normal seasonality despite the fact that you have Apptio and you had strong services signings. So I'm wondering if you could confirm if that's sort of the number that you're suggesting and, you know, was there some transactional pull forward in mainframe from Q4 to Q3 this quarter or are you expecting some deceleration in transaction processing. Maybe you could kind of confirm the number for Q4 and then unpack it a little bit as to why it's below normal seasonality.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThank you. Great Tony, thanks very much for the question. I appreciate it, and I know Patricia really appreciates sticking to one question given it's her last call leading and piloting, and we thank her for all our efforts. But we'll have more time to celebrate in January. But as you stated, we remain confident in what our guidance is overall with regards to top line revenue growth, 3% to 5% albeit, as we said, low end. And that's just practically speaking given we have one more quarter to go. We said we expect similar performance in Q4 as we just executed in Q3 constant currency revenue growth. Right.\nLet me unpack that to your point.\nFirst of all, at the macro level, you know historically we would generate quarter to quarter about $2.9 billion ish of revenue. Last year, by the way, we did $2.6 billion up quarter to quarter in revenue.\nThat 173 number in that ballpark, you're.\nNot too far off is about equivalent to last year. It's about $2.6 billion. But I would tell you one thing underneath that, Tony, is we've seen a very different dramatic change in the currency.\nFX US dollar strengthening to the tune of about $300 million.\nIf you go look at the map.\nBack in 2020 and 2021.\nSo underneath it, pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter performances last year, which, by the way, I would highlight was the peak of our ELA cycle last year. It was our strong first Q4 in a z16 environment. We're going to match that even taking into account the FX headwinds overall that we called out going forward. One last thing that I'll put and then I'll get into the color is on a profit basis, although you didn't ask that.\nHistorically, profit we generate somewhere if I.\nRemember correctly studying over the weekend, about $1.3 billion quarter-to-quarter.\nYou look at our operating pre-tax.\nMargin, which we recommitted a half a point for the year. That puts you in a profit range of, I don't know, $7 billion.\nEight quarter to quarter.\nYou see the fundamental operating leverage of what's happening to our business. So you put all that together.\nWe still believe we have a very.\nConfident year at that 3% to 5%, by the way, led by software delivering three points of that IBM growth, consistent. I would say very good performance competitively in consulting, driving about two points of IBM's growth. Infrastructure. We're on the product cycle downside. We said beginning of the year, and we're consistent. It's about a point that hurts IBM, and then you got the divestiture impact of about a half a point.\nYou put all that together, I think.\nThat's a pretty good year overall and pretty much on top of our model.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay Toni, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we will hear from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nDirector, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thank you for taking my question.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nIt was great to hear about some of the quantifiable success that you've seen in generative AI so far. But maybe flipping that a little bit, whether it's through early consulting engagements or customer conversations, where are you seeing some of the choke points that might hold up people from deploying as fast as they want? And whether it's through foundation models or some of your other tools around the governance side, how that's developing your R&D to develop solutions for those problems?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah, thanks.\nLet me try to address your question here. Look, I think the concerns that people.\nHow are they coming around? Are these models accurate?\nHow accurate are they?\nDo they result in things that may cause long-term liability? People are worried about the conversation because they hear and they read that whether it's artists, whether it's authors, whether it's.\nCode writers are suing some of the.\nProducers of large language models. You alluded to governance. That comes more around life cycle and how do you carry it out over the long term?\nCoupled with this are some people's concerns.\nIf you add their own private data into a model now, what happens to the model? Where is it protected? Where does it stay? Do others learn from it?\nSo if you begin to unpack all.\nOf that, we begin to say, all right, for models that are IBM produced.\nWe will give you indemnification, meaning we.\nAre confident in our ability to stand by the data we have used to train what is being used to be output, and we'll stand behind the same indemnification as you provide for all enterprise software. As you would expect, that's hard for us to do for open source models.\nBut we believe that that takes care.\nThat is why we are so excited about code and customer service too.\nStart with because that's where we believe.\nThat people can benefit from this indemnification. Talking about the governance and the lifecycle side, people are also worried about some of the long term deployment because an.\nEnterprise may well deploy a model for.\nFive or 10 years.\nSo the governance tools that allow you.\nTo keep a lineage of the data.\nUsed to train a model and then, for those adding private data, we give.\nthem, a commitment that data stays with them and the refinements of that model go nowhere else helps to mitigate some of the fears, and uncertainty around those issues.\nI do believe that this is going.\nTo play out well over the next few years.\nBut I also want to point out.\nThere are many cases where people are not worried about some of these risks.\nIf you're giving a quick website response.\nYou could well use a model that may have some of these risks because the danger in using any of those other areas is small.\nSo that is how it's playing out right now.\nI expect to see a lot of deployment in 2024 going into full production.\nAcross the world of whether you use.\nThe word large language models, foundation models, or generative AI.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat, thank you, Matt. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. My question is on consulting. I was very surprised to see 32% bookings growth after 24% the prior quarter, 7 the prior quarter. It's really diverging from your perceived rival in consulting, Accenture. And I was just wondering what the reasoning you would say is behind that. And then, Jim, with regard to those bookings, what does that do for your revenue visibility for consulting not only for Q4 but for early next year? I would think the good book-to-bill might make you feel pretty confident about that, six to eight and continuing. Thanks a lot.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nBen.\nThanks very much for the question. As I said earlier, pleased with the team overall in consulting, not only on the signings and booking, but our revenue is well positioned for that 6% to 8 which give us confidence to reiterate.\nThat, but also the fundamentals of that business.\nRight. We talked a lot about this over the last handful of years. We're getting good operating leverage in that business, good cash contribution. So all in all pretty pleased overall when you look at the bookings overall. I mean let's just put some statistics and let me talk about kind of headwind, tailwind overall because I think what you're trying to get at is the confidence level Arvind and I and the team have about this book of business going forward into Q4 and into 2024. We're still seeing very good demand overall in areas around digital transformation, application modernization, and where there's real technology value, productivity, cost efficiency, quick payback.\nIs there pressure on discretionary-based activity and that, like?\nAbsolutely. But you know what, we've seen that all year long. We haven't seen really any substantive change in the macro and the client buying behaviors overall, but that has enabled us to grow 30+%. By the way, it's the strongest bookings quarter we've had in quite a period of time, and now we've got a trailing twelve-month book-to-bill of 1.16. I think the strongest in about two and a half years overall. Now underneath that, what's going on? One, we've opened up IBM to strategic partnerships. We're seeing great ecosystem velocity and strategic partnership growth.\nSignings were about 50% year over year hyperscalers.\nUnderneath that, 2x signings our hybrid cloud and application modernization Red Hat. We signed north of $1 billion.\nAlone in the quarter.\nNow that's $10 billion inception to date. We got acquisitions that are now accretive and scaling nicely.\nI think from that aspect you.\nLook at the top end growth. We feel pretty confident about the 6% to 8 for this year, and we feel confident about the value and the growth contribution of the growth factor of consulting in our book of business heading into 2024. Now, with that said, headwinds wise. Yeah, listen to every other services consulting company. There are macroeconomic challenges without a doubt, uncertainty, but we gotta go out and compete every single day here. Duration, I would say not only we had great signings growth; we're monitoring our backlog realization.\nOur duration, by the way, this year.\nHas gone up by a couple months, but that revenue will play out over time. You know, all in all, if I sum it up, I think we're taking share. Pleased with the team.\nThank you, Ben. Jayla, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Technology Hardware Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. I'll stick to the one as well, maybe. Jim, this is for you. You didn't change your software consulting guidance ranges for the year. I think you had a minor benefit from Apptio closing early in Q3, but you now expect the full year constant currency revenue growth to be at the low end of the 3% to 5 range. And so I'm just wondering, should we now think about software consulting to grow at the lower ends of those ranges.\nThat you provided earlier?\nEspecially now given some of your Red Hat comments. I'm just trying to understand what has changed underlying the different segments to get to kind of that new view on total revenue and constant currency. Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYes, thanks Erik. I appreciate the question. So similar to, I think Toni asked something similar to this overall, you know, when you look at IBM 3% to 5, just practically speaking, one quarter to go. We said, oh you know, it's better to say we're prudently at the low end of that range. Now let's talk about it by segment.\nYou know software, you dial back 90.\nDays ago we said that we were very excited about the announced acquisition of Apptio. We said that we expected that to close in early Q4. Q4 team did an outstanding job. We got through that regulatory approval. We closed it mid-August. But when we announced that acquisition in July, we actually given our first half performance both in our recurring revenue streams and the strength of that, but also in our transactional book of business, we actually took our full year guidance up to the high end of the range. Now we closed it.\nAnd by the way, we said Apptio.\nWill be about a half a point on the full year. Now we closed it what, a month, month and a half earlier. Okay, so that half a point of contribution in Apptio might be 70 basis points of contribution on a full year. We still feel very confident. By the way, through three quarters we're up 6.5%. That's above our midterm model.\nYes, we have the big wrap on ELAs last year.\nVery interesting, underneath our third-quarter year-to-year performance, we're growing transactional revenue.\nVery different profile than what we started.\nOut in January, which I think prudently we said we expected, transactional revenue was going to be a headwind to us.\nWhat's happening?\nThe new innovation we're bringing to market.\nIs actually creating much more volume of.\nNew ELA content that, by the way, is contributed about a point and a half of growth above our expectation. We're also getting great closing and NRR up 7 points versus history.\nWe think like we just finished.\nAbove our model in Q3 constant currency. On software, we said in the prepared remarks, we expect a pretty similar Q4, you know, at the high end overall. So we're maintaining software.\nIf you look at consulting, we said.\n6 to 8% overall, by the way. Year to date, we're up 6%, actually 6.4% to be exact. We look at Q4 overall. We just talked about, in Ben's question, our strong bookings, book-to-bill at 1.16. The tailwinds on hybrid cloud around strategic partnerships.\nI think we feel pretty good about our overall guidance.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay, very good. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Grossman\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you.\nYou know, Jim, you provided some good.\nDetail on free cash flow year to date. The question really is, are there any early indications on what non-operating items could impact free cash flow next year? You know, working capital, cash taxes, et cetera, as well as how restructuring actions.\nThis year may flow into earnings and cash flow as well over the next several months.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYes, David, thanks for the question. Overall, we'll spend a lot of time in January talking about 2024 free cash flow. But I'm glad you actually asked the question because we've been talking about free cash flow all year long. It's one of Arvind and IBM's two.\nImportant metrics, revenue growth, free cash flow generation.\nWe called out $10.5 billion, by the way, up $1.2 billion this year off of last year where we grew $2.8 billion year to year. We said, you know, that's above our annualized model. Our annualized model is about $750 per year coming on off the I and E and the business fundamentals. You look through Q3, we're up now a billion dollars year to year. We're at $5.1 billion.\nVery high quality, by the way, of.\nThat billion dollars, $700 million of it is cash sourced from operating profit overall. So that's the improving fundamentals of our sustainable revenue growth, our operating leverage, and productivity we're driving in this business.\nAs I said all year long.\nI was very transparent in January, repeated it in April, said it again in July, and now I'll say it again. When we look at that $1.2 billion free cash flow growth year to year, we're going to get most of it through cash source from profit. Read that. About $800 to 900 million. We said that we would get working capital efficiency this year.\nWhy?\nBecause of our Q4 2022 opportunity.\nGap that we missed. We called it out transparently in January. We're seeing that play out. You do the puts and takes?\nYes.\nWe're going to get a little bit of a modest tailwind on structural actions this year that will offset cash tax headwinds.\nBut you look at the underlying $1.2.\nBillion free cash flow growth.\nIt is a high quality, fundamentally driven.\nOut of our revenue growth and operating leverage. Now you look to 2024. We'll spend a lot more time on cash tax. A lot of that is going to be predicated on we finished Q4 overall. But we feel confident with the actions we've been putting in place, and we got to earn the credibility and discipline here, closing out a free cash flow quarter. By the way, that's $5.4 billion.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nVery good, Sheila. Let's take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Brian Essex with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good afternoon.\nThank you for taking the question. I guess maybe, Arvind, if we could just circle back on this.\nWell, worked topic of AI, could you maybe just take a very high-level approach at how you're seeing customers evaluated adoption and how that might impact the nature of contracts within the consulting business in feedback, the watsonx platform, maybe adoption, initial read on adoption rates, and view into how consulting could be the tip of the spear there? Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM",
    "content2": "All right, thanks Brian for the question.\nConsulting is going to be the tip of the spear, but it's not going to be the only, because some clients do have enough expertise inside to do things on our own.\nAs we approach clients, trying to use.\nI'll call it a big public chatbot.\nTo perhaps improve some service is not where they look to us, and we've been very clear that's not where we are going to go, and we do not actually serve up any of those services.\nHowever, I'll take some, maybe some quick.\nExamples as I go through. So with a large, I'll use the word financial services company. They want to use generative AI to dramatically improve the productivity of their developers.\nThey actually use their own proprietary languages.\nNot only the common languages that are available outside.\nThey are then asking the question who.\nCan I trust to augment their model?\nGive it to me and I don't.\nReally want to get into all the details of how I might use it.\nBut I want them to provide the technology. In this case, Brian, we would work.\nWith them to augment the model using their language, their data, and their code snippets. We would do it in a way that they are completely comfortable, meaning 100% that that leaks nowhere else.\nThey will take back the model.\nIt now becomes an as-a-service.\nDeployment in their private cloud infrastructure and.\nWe monetize it as is typical for as-a-service software.\nI'll take another example that we are.\nBuilding out with Dun & Bradstreet, and I mentioned that briefly on the call.\nIn that case it is consulting-led. They want to work with consulting to.\nUse watsonx in this case, but to help them create solutions that let their clients get greater insight, aka helps D&B monetize their data better.\nIn that case it is absolutely consulting-led.\nI think without consulting we would not have landed that deal.\nLet me go to others because there.\nAre also examples where our consulting team.\nIs using both what's available with Azure.\nOpenAI as an example to go win deals because they have built up the expertise.\nThey've also built up expertise on Amazon's.\nBraket platform and they're going forward with winning deals on those.\nIn that case they're coming in with.\nA methodology with knowledge, with the thousands of trained consultants who know how to work on those platforms, and they're working.\nWith the clients to go do that. I think these are all examples of what's working.\nI think you're trying to also ask.\nIs it going to be consulting or?\nIs it going to be software? Look, we didn't say much.\nOn the.\nCall on this topic. We just characterized it as low hundreds.\nOf millions of dollars of booking. But in the absence of anything else.\nThink of that as maybe half and half between consulting and software, which does.\nTell you that a couple of points.\nOf growth for both those units came.\nFrom the generative AI that we've been putting out.\nI think that's the best way to think about it in terms of what's happening right now.\nWe are certainly expecting and planning that that will only increase as the quarters go on.\nAll right, so let me now wrap up the call. This Q3 performance reinforced our confidence.\nIn the strategy and in our ability to deliver value to enterprise clients in today's environment. We're excited of the opportunities ahead of us and I look forward to taking.\nYou through our continued progress and our.\nView of 2024 in January.\nThank you all.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay, Sheila, let me turn it back.\nTo you to close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this.\nSam.\nWelcome and thank you for standing by at this time. All participants are in a listen only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, IBM's Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am. You may begin.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Q3 2023 earnings presentation. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Patricia Murphy and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow to provide additional information to our investors. Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for joining us.\nBefore we start, let me address the outbreak of war in Israel. We condemn all acts of terrorism.\nWe are also saddened over the loss of innocent lives and join the global community in the hope that peace and.\nSafety can be restored. Let me now turn to our business performance.\nIn Q3 we had solid growth across revenue, profit, and free cash.\nFlow while delivering innovations and positioning our.\nBusiness to capture future opportunities.\nOn the.\nBroader trends we are seeing in the market.\nTechnology continues to serve as a fundamental.\nSource of competitive advantage.\nBusinesses and governments around the world are.\nLooking for opportunities to address demographic shifts, make the supply chains more resilient, and improve sustainability.\nMore recently, geopolitical events and the reality.\nOf higher for longer add to the growing uncertainty.\nTechnology helps organizations better deal with the.\nMany challenges they face, we see both tailwinds and headwinds to overall spending. Nearly every business we talk to wants to leverage technology to offer better services.\nScale more quickly and fuel growth without increasing their footprint. This has been driving demand for technologies that boost productivity and competitiveness like hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. Overall, we believe the tailwinds outweigh the.\nHeadwinds and technology spend will continue to outpace GDP.\nIn this past quarter, we saw good.\nRevenue growth in software and consulting in infrastructure. More than a year into the product.\nCycle, we continue to see good adoption of z16. Our overall growth reflects our ability to.\nHelp clients to leverage data and AI for competitive advantage, automate IT environments, and seamlessly integrate hybrid cloud solutions.\nWe also continue to position our business.\nFor the future, launching new products and offerings, forging and expanding key partnerships, investing in talent and skills, and focusing our portfolio.\nWe have been taking concrete actions to.\nDeliver productivity in our own business.\nAll of this results in an IBM that is aligned to our clients most.\nPressing needs and has the strongest financial profile.\nOur Q3 results are another proof point.\nTypically at this point I talk about.\nHybrid cloud and the progress we have made.\nHybrid cloud remains vitally important to our.\nClients and to our business.\nGiven the inflection in AI and more.\nSpecifically, generative AI, I want to spend more time today on AI and how we are approaching this opportunity.\nWe believe that generative AI will be.\nMultimodal with clients using a combination of IBM's models.\nOther companies model their own proprietary models and open source models.\nThis hybrid approach to AI is similar.\nTo the hybrid approach to cloud.\nLet me give you an overview of.\nThe capabilities we have been building.\nOur generative AI software stack starts with.\nRed Hat OpenShift, which serves as the foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment.\nData services help make their data ready.\nFor AI, watsonx is a core platform.\nThat enables clients to train, tune, validate.\nDeploy AI models.\nWe are providing models that address specific.\nDomains such as code language and cybersecurity, among others.\nOur AI assistants include the watsonx code.\nAssistant to augment developers. What's the next assistant to augment customer service agents, and what's the next Orchestrate to augment employees?\nThis quarter we introduced new AI capabilities.\nFor our clients and partners, we unveiled Granite, a multi-billion parameter.\nFoundation model on watsonx AI which.\nExcels in both language and code.\nWe also introduced the watsonx Code Assistant. This includes the watsonx Code Assistant for.\nZ to help clients accelerate the modernization of mainframe code and apps.\nIt's fueled by a 20 billion parameter.\nModel and can, as an example, swiftly translate COBOL to Java.\nThere are hundreds of billions of lines.\nOf code written in COBOL, so the opportunity is significant.\nLooking forward, we plan to launch what's.\nwatsonx.governance before the end of the year that provides governance tools businesses need to mitigate risks and ensure compliance through the AI lifecycle. This is a key consideration for clients as they go beyond early proof of concept into real deployments to bring our AI capabilities to life.\nWe have more than 20,000 data and.\nAI consultants, including a Center of Excellence for generative AI.\nOur teams help clients navigate the AI.\nLandscape from crafting a strategy, understanding how AI can be used, and deploying AI responsibly.\nThese consultants also provide valuable real-time.\nFeedback to our product teams, as in hybrid cloud.\nOur ecosystem across JSIs, ISVs, and hyperscalers plays a critical role in bringing generative.\nAI to our clients.\nIn the work we are doing, clear.\nPatterns are emerging in terms of the.\nAI enterprise use cases based on extensive feedback and trials.\nTo date, three have risen to the top.\nCode modernization, customer service, and digital labor all have broad relevance and deliver tangible business benefits. We have also seen this internally as.\nWe apply our AI capabilities to areas.\nSuch as client support, HR, IT optimization, and source to pay to automate a.\nSignificant portion of tasks and improve the productivity of our people.\nOur book of business in the third.\nQuarter specifically related to generative AI was.\nIn the low hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe interest is larger with thousands of hands-on interactions with our clients.\nThese are across our largest clients and smaller clients, which lays the groundwork for.\nFuture, what's the next opportunities?\nLet me close the discussion on AI by talking about a couple of client examples. Dun & Bradstreet is leveraging our consulting.\nAnd software capabilities fueled by watsonx to.\nHelp their clients create proprietary generative AI solutions.\nIBM and EY also just announced a new solution powered by watsonx Orchestrate to enhance EY's people advisory services.\nWe continue to bring innovations to the.\nMarket in areas other than AI.\nThis includes new innovations to our industry.\nLeading hybrid cloud platform Red Hat OpenShift.\nWhich was recognized recently by both Gartner.\nAnd Forrester as the leader in container management.\nWe completed the acquisition of Apptio, which complements our IT automation capabilities. In quantum, we're making good progress in building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials. In closing, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We launched our generative AI platform and.\nHave good momentum in helping our clients use this important technology.\nWe continue to take portfolio actions to.\nIncrease our focus on hybrid cloud and AI and we are applying AI within our own business, improving execution speed and unlocking real value.\nAll of this reinforces my confidence in our future. We're executing a strategy that closely resonates.\nWith our clients' needs and this is.\nPropelling our business forward 3/4 into the year. We are well positioned to deliver on 2023 expectations for both revenue growth and free cash flow.\nNow to offer you a more detailed view of our results and the rest of 2023, I'll hand it over to Jim.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights of the quarter. We delivered $14.8 billion of revenue, $2.3.\nbillion of operating pre-tax income and.\n$2.2 of operating earnings per share.\nThrough the first three quarters of the year we generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow. Reported revenue growth was 4.6%.\nThis includes just over a point of growth from currency translation, which is significantly.\nLess than the currency rates suggested in July.\nIn fact, currency movements over the last.\n90 days impacted our Q3 revenue.\nBy about $250 million. At constant currency, our revenue was up 3.5% as is typical. I'll focus the discussion on constant currency. Arvind talked about clients' priorities in today's.\nEnvironment, which are driving solid growth in.\nOur software and consulting offerings. I'll remind you, software and consulting are.\nOur two growth factors and together make up about three quarters of our revenue base. Software revenue was up 6% as clients leverage their data for insights and automate their IT. In a hybrid environment, we had good growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing revenue.\nOur consulting business had another solid quarter with 5% revenue growth, strong signings performance, and a book-to-bill ratio greater.\nthan 1.15 over the last year.\nWe are capitalizing on our continued momentum in the market as we help clients get value from hybrid cloud and AI and leverage our strategic partnerships. Our infrastructure revenue was down 3%, with growth in Z systems. More and more we are seeing clients.\nEmbrace IBM Z in their hybrid cloud environments, especially in regulated industries.\nThis growth was offset by declines in.\nDistributed infrastructure and infrastructure support.\nIBM's revenue growth, together with a good.\nPortfolio mix and yield from our productivity initiatives generated strong margin profit and free cash flow performance.\nOperating gross margin expanded 160 basis points and operating pre-tax margin expanded 170 basis points. Within that PTI margin, we absorbed a.\nYear-to-year currency impact of over 150 basis points.\nDespite that headwind, our margin expansion was broad-based with improvements in every business segment. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been.\nPart of our operating and financial models.\nThese ongoing productivity initiatives enable reinvestment in the business, increase financial flexibility, and contribute to margin expansion. Our activities range from simplifying our application.\nEnvironment to digitally transforming our business processes.\nBy applying AI at scale, we are ahead of pace to achieve our target of $2 billion in annual run rate.\nSavings by the end of 2024. While there is still more to do.\nI am pleased with our progress. The combination of our revenue and margin.\nPerformance and yielded strong profit growth.\nOperating pre-tax profit was up 17% to $2.3 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash.\nflow in the quarter and over $5 billion year-to-date, which is up $1 billion versus last year.\nFree cash flow growth through Q1, Q2, and Q3 was primarily driven by cash.\nSource from our operating profit performance.\nWe also had working capital efficiencies driven by solid collections. These growth drivers were partially offset by higher performance-based compensation payments earlier in the year. In terms of cash usage year to.\ndate, we spent about $5 billion on acquisitions and returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our resulting cash balance at the end of September was $11 billion.\nThat's up over $2 billion from year end. But with the acquisition of Apptio in.\nQ3 cash is down over $5 billion from June.\nOur debt balance is now $55 billion, also down from June. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals.\nAre solid with sustainable revenue growth, margin.\nExpansion, solid cash generation, and a strong.\nBalance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business into the future.\nTurning to the segments, Software revenue grew.\n6% with contribution from hybrid platform, solutions, and transaction processing. This performance reflects growth in both our transactional revenue and our recurring revenue base.\nWhich is about 80% of our annual software revenue.\nIn hybrid platform and solutions revenue was.\nUp 7% with growth across Red Hat, Automation, and Data and AI. As we execute our platform based approach.\nThe hybrid cloud and AI Red Hat revenue was up 8%.\nWe continue to deliver good growth in.\nOpenShift and Ansible, both gaining share again this quarter.\nClients are committing to our hybrid cloud approach with annual bookings up 14% in the quarter. This includes double-digit growth across [RHEL], OpenShift, and Ansible, partially offset by headwinds in consumption-based services.\nIT and Business Automation are top client.\nPriorities and we've been investing to capture the opportunity. This quarter our automation revenue grew 13% with pervasive growth across all business areas. We had strength in AIOps and management driven by good performance in Instana, Turbonomic.\nNow Apptio as clients look to optimize business outcomes and boost productivity.\ndata and AI revenue was up 6%. Growth areas include data fabric and customer.\nCare as enterprise clients are both preparing.\nFor and adopting generative AI solutions. Leveraging watsonx, we also grew in asset.\nSupply chain management as we help enterprises run sustainable operations.\nSecurity revenue declined 3%. We delivered growth.\nIn security software driven by data security.\nIdentity and access management. This was more than offset by declines.\nIn managed security services.\nLooking across these businesses, our hybrid platform.\nSolutions ARR has grown to $14 billion, up 7% since last year, in transaction processing. Revenue was up 5%.\nThroughout this year we've been talking about how the success of the last couple of Z system cycles is driving demand.\nFor this mission critical software.\nThis together with price increases contributed to.\nYear-to-date growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in transaction processing.\nMoving to profit for the software segment, we expanded gross and pre-tax margins.\nOur pre-tax margin was up 120 basis points even while absorbing over 2 points of impact from currency.\nWe continue to deliver operating leverage driven.\nBy our revenue scale mix.\nThis quarter.\nOur consulting revenue was up.\n5% with growth across all three lines of business and geographies with another quarter of strong signings.\nAs I said, our trailing twelve-month book-to-bill ratio is now over 1.15. Clients continue to prioritize transformation projects that.\nEnable cost savings and productivity.\nThese results are a proof point that.\nWe are well positioned to meet these needs in today's complex environment.\nIBM's focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy has become even more of a differentiator as clients' interest in generative AI continues to ramp. We are helping clients understand how AI.\nCan be used to automate tasks, make.\nBetter decisions with speed, and improve customer experiences. We made a series of AI announcements.\nOver the last few months, demonstrating continued advancement of our strategic partnerships.\nWe're providing clients with the opportunity to.\nAccelerate their transformation and deploy generative AI.\nResponsibly, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities.\nOf IBM, our partners, or a combination.\nToday, our strategic partnerships account for about 40% of consulting revenue and have continued.\nTo grow double digits across revenue and signings.\nIn aggregate, our hyperscaler partnership revenue was.\nUp over 40%, and signings essentially doubled year to year.\nAdditionally, our Red Hat practice, which helps.\nClients optimize how they build, deploy, and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment.\nHas continued to grow at a double.\nBook-to-bill rate with over $1 billion of signings in the quarter.\nAll of what I just mentioned, from.\nMarket demand to how we're positioned and partnering to our investments to drive growth.\nIs reflected in our overall consulting revenue performance.\nYou can see that play out across our three lines of business.\nIn business transformation, revenue grew 5% again, led by data and technology transformations including.\nAI- and analytics-focused projects, finance- and supply-chain transformations also contributed to growth in technology consulting. Revenue was up 1%.\nGrowth in cloud-based application development and.\nModernization work was partially offset by declines.\nIn on-prem application-focused projects. In application operations, revenue grew 7% driven.\nBy both cloud application management and platform engineering services.\nIn platform engineering, we help clients design.\nAn application environment that runs securely and smoothly at scale.\nMoving to consulting profit, we expanded gross margin 150 basis points. Pretax margin expanded 40 basis points to just over 10%. Our year to year margin performance reflects productivity actions we've taken, mitigated by increased.\nLabor costs and about a point of pre-tax margin impact from currency.\nMoving to the infrastructure segment, revenue was down 3%. Hybrid infrastructure revenue was flat while infrastructure support declined 7%. Within hybrid infrastructure, Z systems grew 9%.\nIn a seasonally smaller revenue quarter, z16 revenue remains well ahead of prior cycles.\nAfter six quarters of availability, the program strength reflects both growing enterprise.\nWorkload requirements and the economic value at.\nScale of the platform in traditional processing and Linux consolidation. In fact, installed MIPS capacity for Linux.\non Z has grown more than fourfold over the last decade.\nClients continue to value the security, resiliency.\nHybrid cloud capabilities of the IBM Z platform.\nDistributed infrastructure revenue was down 6% as.\nCompared to a strong growth in last year of 21% as we introduced innovation across storage and Power10. This quarter we had growth in Power.\nOffset by declines in storage. In the infrastructure segment we had strong.\nGross and pre-tax margin performance.\nPretax margin expanded 350 basis points reflecting.\nBenefits from portfolio mix with our Z.\nSystems performance and productivity while absorbing over.\nA point of impact from currency.\nNow let me bring it back up.\nTo the IBM level, to talk about our expectations before we go to Q and A.\nJust about two years ago we introduced.\nToday's IBM, a more focused business with a platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI.\nSince then we've continued to invest organically.\nInorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem, and our.\nTalent base and drive productivity across our business. The result is a business that addresses.\nToday's client needs with a stronger financial profile.\nOur Q3 performance reinforces this progress with 3.5% revenue growth, gross and pre-tax margin expansion, and strong free cash flow generation. Now, with three quarters of the year.\nBehind us, we are holding our full year view of our two primary financial metrics, revenue growth and free cash flow.\nWe continue to expect constant currency revenue.\nGrowth of 3% to 5% and free cash flow of about $10.5 billion.\nThat's up $1.2 billion over last year. We've had solid revenue performance all year in our growth vectors of software and consulting.\nWe still expect software revenue growth at the high end of its mid single digit model and consulting revenue in the 6% to 8 range.\nInfrastructure revenue of course reflects product cycle dynamics. In total, with 1/4 to go, it's prudent to assume the low end of.\nIBM's 3% to 5 range.\nWe are making great progress in our productivity initiatives.\nThe work we are doing to digitally transform our business not only makes us more nimble by simplifying and streamlining our.\nProcesses and operations, but it also frees.\nUp spend for reinvestment provides financial flexibility.\nAnd delivers operating leverage. This contributes to solid margin and free cash flow performance.\nWe continue to expect about 0.5 point of operating pre-tax margin improvement and we.\nSee a mid teens tax rate for the year. Our free cash flow performance has been.\nDriven primarily from our profit performance.\nThrough the first three quarters.\nWe're up $1 billion year to year, and we delivered nearly 50% of our full year expectation, which is ahead of our historical attainment. While, as always, we are reliant on.\nA seasonally strong Q4.\nWe're on track to achieve about $10.5.\nbillion for the year.\nAs I look specifically at the Q4, with the recent currency movements, we.\nwe see currency to be neutral to a 1-point headwind to revenue growth.\nThat's nearly $600 million worse than 90 days ago. I'd expect constant currency revenue growth in.\nThe Q4 to be similar to the third.\nThat's despite a tough compare from last year's strong ELA contribution in software and the large z16 transactional performance in infrastructure. This demonstrates continued momentum in our underlying business.\nBring it all together.\nWe've clearly got a higher growth, higher.\nValue business with strong cash generation.\nA business well positioned for the future. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Patricia, let's get started.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of this presentation. Then second, I'll try this one last time, but I ask you to refrain from multipart questions to allow time for more people to participate. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. To ask a question, please press star one and record your name clearly. If you need to withdraw your question, press star two. Again, to ask a question, please press star one. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nAmit Daryanan\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYep, thanks a lot.\nGood afternoon, everyone. And I will stick to Patricia's one last time, ask one question only, room.\nI guess. Arvind, there's a lot of macro concerns.\nOut there, to say the least.\nI'm hoping you could spend a little bit of time just talking about when you talk to your customers.\nI'm sure you engage with a lot of the Fortune 500 companies.\nGiven this macro environment, how are they?\nShifting or prioritizing their IT budget dollars? I fully understand everything you're talking about, generative AI, and how beneficial it's going to be.\nBut given the macro environment, given the.\nConstrained IT budgets, I guess where are they taking money away from to fund these investments? I'd love to just understand the customer feedback you're getting and how's the priority changing as we go forward?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nHi Amit.\nSo thanks for the question and it's actually wonderful to talk about this. So generative AI. Just for me to very quickly reiterate the use cases, we found that our.\nClients were really climbing onto watsonx for code, for customer service, and for what I'll call.\nIt's generative digital workers, which is productivity in every enterprise function. So if you look at code per person, every one of the clients said we don't intend to get rid of any developers, but this allows us to take care of the tech debt.\nThat we've accumulated and makes every developer more productive. Amit, I'll kind of point out most enterprises are very quick to realize if.\nYou are more productive. That means you have a competitive advantage to your peers.\nAnd if they have a competitive advantage.\nTo their peers, they'll take share without spending more on labor.\nThat's an incredible long term competitive advantage. When you go to customer service there.\nIt's a cost takeout aspect, but it's not 100%. There is probably a 20% to 30. If you can have more calls, more chats answered by AI, that means you can have much more volume with a smaller number of people. So there is both.\nAlso, I'll point out to our audience.\nAI does not get tired, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get upset. So there is a NPF improvement, you get along with it.\nThen on the third one on.\nDigital workers, there likely is a small productivity improvement, but I would call it more in the 4%, 5%, 10%, not 20%, 30%, 40%. So in the macro headwinds you're mentioning, higher interest rates, tougher to get skilled people, and all of the issues around the geopolitical uncertainty that causes some of the concern or might have caused a pause in some other environments, the AI side.\nTo be candid, the hybrid cloud.\nSide offers them a way through that.\nWithout having to decrease their ambitions for next year. I think we are seeing every.\nOne of them plays to that. I think that these are more fundamental, these are more core processes than.\nSome of the other areas that people.\nwere worrying about two or three years ago when two or three years ago people were worrying a lot about what do I do to keep all our employees happy, and can I add up all the tools for that? I think there's much less of a focus on that area.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we will hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much. I was wondering if you could comment.\nA little further on the Red Hat deceleration in Q3, Jim sounded like was driven partly by consumption-based services that were somewhat weaker.\nAre you still expecting Red Hat growth in that 11% to 13 range for?\nAnd can you unpack some of the software elements in Q4 between Red Hat, transaction processing, and perhaps Apptio?\nThank you so much.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah, thanks Wamsi.\nI appreciate the question. Obviously we're very pleased overall with our software segment performance. Growing 8% actual 6 at constant currency really led pretty pervasively with growth across the board. Automation led Red Hat at 8% as you said and I'll come to that in a second. But data and AI overall really underpinning all that is like we said starting the year on a very strong solid recurring revenue base. High value, 80% of that portfolio by the way, growing mid single digit growth. You see that play out in our transaction processing that we call the growth vector and then also our hybrid platform and solution business, $14 billion ARR. That's growing high single digit overall. Now within that you see Red Hat. Red Hat we talked about in the prepared remarks.\nFirst of all, Arvind and I would.\nAcknowledge we came in a couple points below our expectation, and I think that's an execution discussion overall embedded in that.\nWhere did it come from? It came from because I think this is very important.\nIt came from the consumption-based services offering side of the equation, which, by the way, is about 20% of our portfolio. Shorter duration overall. It went from last quarter high single-digit, which is about what the model is, to low single-digit overall.\nIf you look at that and compare that.\nNow let's look at the other part of the portfolio, the remaining 80%.\nThat is our subscription based business.\nThat's our relative franchise industry market leader.\nThat's Red Hat OpenShift and that's Ansible.\nWe had a very strong annualized bookings in the quarter, which, again, subscription based business model we talked about all year long. We were going to be back-end loaded on renewals. We grew that mid-teens overall, including services. By the way, if I extract out that 20% portfolio of services and just look at the core subscription based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift, and Ansible.\nWe grew 19% overall, 110+% NRR.\nOn that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40%, with RHEL growing double digits. So putting all that together, I think it's prudent right now when we look at Q4, we're only building into our model again software at the high end of our segment model, we're only building in high single digit.\nWe have to continue to monitor what?\nHappened to us in Q3.\nGet the team focused on execution.\nI would tell you, just given the signings growth that we posted in the Q3, and, by the way, another good pipeline in the Q4.\nWe feel very confident in the long.\nThe posture of Red Hat growing double digits. We just got to get through and monitor what's happening to us on the services side. So thanks very much for the question.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks Wamsi. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYes, thank you for taking the question, Jim. It sounds like your guidance for Q4, given you expect revenues at constant currency to be at the low end, is somewhere around $17.3 billion, which is quite a bit below normal seasonality despite the fact that you have Apptio and you had strong services signings. So I'm wondering if you could confirm if that's sort of the number that you're suggesting, and you know, was there some transactional pull forward in mainframe from Q4 to Q3 this quarter or are you expecting some deceleration in transaction processing? Maybe you could kind of confirm the number for Q4 and then unpack it a little bit as to why it's below normal seasonality. Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nGreat Tony, thanks very much for the question. I appreciate it, and I know Patricia really appreciates sticking to one question given it's her last call leading and piloting, and we thank her for all our efforts. But we'll have more time to celebrate in January. But as you stated, we remain confident in what our guidance is overall with regards to top line revenue growth, 3% to 5 albeit as we said low end. And that's just practically speaking given we have one more quarter to go. We said we expect similar performance Q4 as we just executed in Q3 constant currency revenue growth. Right.\nLet me unpack that to your point. First of all, at the macro level.\nYou know, historically we would generate quarter to quarter about $2.9 billion ish of revenue.\nLast year, by the way, we did.\n$2.6 billion up quarter to quarter in revenue. That 173 number, in that ballpark you're not too far off, is about equivalent to last year. It's about $2.6 billion.\nBut I would tell you one thing.\nUnderneath that, Tony, is we've seen a very different, dramatic change in the currency effects. US dollar strengthening to the tune of about $300 million, if you go look at the math back into Q2 2020, Q2 2021.\nSo, underneath it, pretty consistent quarter to.\nQuarter performances last year, which, by the way, I would highlight, was the peak of our ELA cycle last year, and it was our strong first Q4 in a z16 environment. We're going to match that, even taking into account the FX headwinds overall that we called out going forward. One last thing that I'll put, and then I'll get into the color, is.\nOn a profit basis, although you didn't ask that. Historically, profit we generate somewhere, if I.\nRemember correctly studying over the weekend, about $1.3 billion quarter to quarter.\nYou look at our operating pre-tax.\nMargin, which we recommitted a half a point for the year, that puts you in a profit range of, I don't know, $7 billion, $8 billion quarter to quarter. So you see the fundamental operating leverage of what's happening to our business. So you put all that together.\nWe still believe we have a very.\nConfident year at that 3% to 5, by the way, led by software delivering three points of that IBM growth. Consistent, I would say, very good performance competitively in consulting, driving about two points of IBM's growth. Infrastructure, we're on the product cycle downside. We said beginning of the year, and we're consistent. It's about a point hurts IBM and.\nThen you got the divestiture impact of.\nAbout a half a point.\nYou put all that together, I think.\nThat's a pretty good year overall and pretty much on top of our model.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay, Sheila, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we will hear from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nDirector, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thank you for taking my question. It was great to hear about some.\nOf the quantifiable success that you've seen in generative AI so far. But maybe flipping that a little bit, whether it's through early consulting engagements or customer conversations, where are you seeing some of the choke points that might hold up people from deploying as fast as they want? And whether it's through foundation models or some of your other tools.\nAround the governance side, how that's developing your R&D to develop solutions for those problems.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah, thanks. Let me try to address your question here. Look, I think the concerns that people have are coming around.\nAre these models accurate?\nHow accurate are they? Do they result in things that may cause long term liability? People are worried about the conversation because they hear and they read that whether it's artists, whether it's authors, whether it's.\nCode writers are suing some of the.\nProducers of large language models. You alluded to governance that comes more around life cycle and how do you carry it out over the long term?\nCoupled with this are some people's concerns.\nIf you add their own private data into a model now, what happens to the model?\nWhere is it protected?\nWhere does it stay?\nDo others learn from it? So if you begin to unpack all.\nOf that, we begin to say, all right, for models that are IBM produced, we will give you indemnification, meaning we are confident in our ability to stand by the data we have used to train what is being used to be output. We'll stand behind the same indemnification.\nAs you provide for all enterprise software.\nAs you would expect, that's hard for us to do for open source models.\nBut we believe that that takes care.\nThat is why we are so.\nExcited about code and customer service too.\nStart with, because that's where we believe that people can benefit from this indemnification. Talking about the governance and the lifecycle side, people are also worried about some of the long-term deployment because an enterprise may well deploy a model for five or 10 years.\nSo, the governance tools that allow you.\nTo keep a lineage of the data.\nUsed to train a model and then.\nFor those adding private data, we give them a commitment that data stays with them and the refinements of that model go nowhere else. Helps to mitigate some of the fears.\nUncertainty around those issues. I do believe that this is going.\nTo play out well over the next few years, but I also want to point out there are many cases where people are not worried about some of these risks. If you're giving a quick website response, you could well use a model that may have some of these risks because the danger in using any of those other areas is small.\nSo that is how it's playing out right now.\nI expect to see a lot of deployment in 2024 going into full production.\nAcross the world of whether you use.\nThe word large language models or foundation models or generative AI.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nGreat, thank you, Matt. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. My question is on consulting. I was very surprised to see 32% bookings growth after 24% the prior quarter, 7% the prior quarter. It's really diverging from your perceived rival in consulting, Accenture. And I was just wondering what the reasoning you would say is behind that. And then Jim, with regard to those bookings, what does that do for your revenue visibility for consulting not only for the Q4, but for early next year? I would think the good book-to-bill might make you feel pretty confident about that 6% to 8% and continuing. Thanks a lot.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nBen.\nThanks very much for the question. As I said earlier, pleased with the team overall in consulting, not only on the signings and booking, but our revenue is well positioned for that 6% to 8 which give us confidence to reiterate that, but also the fundamentals of that business. Right. We talked a lot about this over the last handful of years. We're getting good operating leverage in that business, good cash contribution. So all in all pretty pleased overall when you look at the bookings overall. I mean, let's just put some statistics and let me talk about kind of headwind, tailwind overall because I think what you're trying to get at is the confidence level Arvind and I and the team have of course about this book of business going forward into Q4 and into 2024.\nYou know we're still seeing very good demand overall in areas around digital transformation.\nApplication modernization and where there's real technology.\nValue, productivity, cost efficiency, quick payback.\nIs there pressure on discretionary based activity?\nThat? Like absolutely. But you know what, we've seen that all year long. We haven't seen really any substantive change in the macro and the client buying behaviors overall, but that has enabled us to grow 30+% . By the way, it's strongest bookings quarter we had in quite a period of time, and now we've got a trailing twelve-month with a book-to-bill of 1.16. I think the strongest in about two and a half years overall. Now underneath that, what's going on? One, we've opened up IBM to strategic partnerships. We're seeing great ecosystem velocity and strategic partnership growth.\nSignings were about 50% year over year hyperscalers.\nUnderneath that 2x signings, our hybrid cloud and application modernization Red Hat. We signed north of $1 billion.\nAlone in the quarter.\nNow that's $10 billion inception to date.\nWe got acquisitions that are now accretive and scaling nicely. So I think from that aspect you.\nLook at the top end growth. We feel pretty confident about the 6% to 8 for this year, and we feel confident about the value and the growth contribution of the growth factor of consulting in our book of business heading into 2024. Now, with that said, headwinds-wise. Yeah, listen to every other services consulting company. There are macroeconomic challenges, without a doubt, uncertainty, but we got to go out and compete every single day here.\nDuration, I would say not only.\nWe had great signings growth; we're monitoring our backlog realization. Our duration, by the way, this year has went up by a couple months. But that revenue will play out over time. And you know, all in all, if I sum it up, I think we're taking share, pleased with the team.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Ben. Shila, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Technology Hardware Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. I'll stick to the one as well. And maybe Jim, this is for you. You didn't change your software consulting guidance ranges for the year. I think you had a minor benefit from Apptio closing early in Q3. But you now expect the full year constant currency revenue growth to be at the low end of the 3% to 5 range. I'm just wondering, should we now think about software consulting to grow at the lower ends of those ranges that you provided earlier? Especially now given some of your Red Hat comments. I'm just trying to understand what has changed underlying the different segments to get to kind of that new view on total revenue and constant currency. Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYes, thanks Erik.\nI appreciate the question. So similar to, I think Tony asked something similar to this overall, you know, when you look at IBM, 3% to 5%, just practically speaking one quarter to go, we said, you know, it's better to say we're prudently at the low end of that range. Now let's talk about it by segment. You know software, you dial back 90 days ago we said that we were.\nVery excited about the announced acquisition of Apptio.\nWe said that we expected that to close in early Q4. The team did an outstanding job. We got through that regulatory approval. We closed it mid August. But when we announced that acquisition in July, we actually, given our first half performance both in our recurring revenue streams and the strength of that, but also in our transactional book of business, we actually took our full year guidance up to the high end of the range. Now we closed it.\nAnd by the way, we said Apptio.\nWill be about a half a point on the full year. Now we close it what, a month, month and a half earlier. Okay, so that half a point of contribution in Apptio deal might be 70 basis points of contribution on a full year.\nWe still feel very confident by the.\nWe're through three quarters we're up 6.5%. That's above our midterm model.\nYes, we have the peak RAP on ELAs last year. But, very interesting underneath our Q3.\nYear to year, year to year performance.\nWe're growing transactional revenue. Very different profile than what we started.\nOut in January, which I think prudently we said we expected transactional revenue was going to be a headwind to us.\nWhat's happening?\nThe new innovation we're bringing to market is actually creating much more volume of new ELA content. That, by the way, has contributed about a point and a half of growth above our expectation. We're also getting great traction and NRR up 7 points versus history. So we think, like, we just finished above our model on Q3 constant currency on software.\nWe said in the prepared remarks we.\nExpect a pretty similar Q4, you know, at the high end overall. So we're maintaining software. If you look at consulting, we said 6% to 8 overall, by the way, year to date, we're up 6%, actually 6.4% to be exact. And we look at Q4 overall. We just talked about in Ben's question. Our strong bookings are book-to-bill at 1.16. The tailwinds on hybrid cloud around strategic partnerships.\nI think we feel pretty good about our overall guidance.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay, very good. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Grossman\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you.\nYou know, Jim, you provided some good.\nDetails on free cash flow year to date. The question really is, are there any early indications on what non-operating items could impact free cash flow next year? You know, working capital, cash taxes, et cetera, as well as how restructuring actions this year may flow into earnings and cash flow as well over the next several months?\n\nJim Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah, David, thanks for the question. Overall, you know, we'll spend a lot of time in January talking about 2024 free cash flow. But I'm glad you actually asked the question because we've been talking about free cash flow all year long. It's one of Arvind and IBM's two important metrics, revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We called out $10.5 billion, by the way, up $1.2 billion this year off.\nOf last year, where we grew 2.8%.\nBillion year to year. We said, you know, that's above our annualized model. Our annualized model is about 750 per year. Coming on off the I and E and the business fundamentals, you look through the Q3, we're up now a billion dollars year to year. We're at $5.1 billion.\nVery high quality, by the way, of.\nThat billion dollars, $700 million of it is cash sourced from operating profit overall. So that's the improving fundamentals of our sustainable revenue growth, our operating leverage, and productivity we're driving in this business.\nAs I said, all year long.\nI was very transparent in January, repeated it in April, said it again in July, and now I'll say it again. When we look at that $1.2 billion free cash flow growth year to year.\nWe're going to get most of it.\nThrough cash flows from profit. Read that. About $800 to 900 million.\nWe said that we would get.\nWorking capital efficiency this year.\nWhy?\nBecause of our Q4 2022 opportunity gap that we missed and we called it out transparently in January. We're seeing that play out. You do the puts and takes. Yes, we're going to get a little bit of a modest tailwind on structural actions this year that will offset cash tax headwinds. But you look at the underlying $1.2 billion free cash flow growth. It is high quality, fundamentally driven out of our revenue growth and operating leverage. Now you look to 2024. We'll spend a lot more time on cash tax. A lot of that is going to be predicated on where we actually finished Q4 overall. But we feel confident with the actions we've been putting in place, and we got to earn the credibility and discipline here closing out a free cash flow quarter. By the way, that's $5.4 billion.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM",
    "content3": "Very good, Sheila. Let's take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Brian Essex with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good afternoon.\nThank you for taking the question. I guess maybe Arvind, if we could just circle back on this.\nWell-worn topic of AI. Could you maybe just take a very high level approach at how you're seeing customers evaluating adoption and how that might impact the nature of contracts within the consulting business and the watsonx platform, maybe adoption, initial read on adoption rates, and view into how consulting could be the tip of the spear there.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you.\nAll right, thanks Brian for the question.\nSo consulting is going to be the tip of the spear, but it's not going to be the only because some.\nClients do have enough expertise inside to.\nDo things on our own.\nAs we approach clients trying to use, I'll call it a big public chatbot to perhaps.\nImprove some service is not where they.\nLook to us, and we've been very clear that's not where we are going to go, and we do not actually serve up any of those services. However, I'll take some, maybe some quick examples as I go through. So with a large, I'll use the word financial services company, they want to use generative AI to dramatically improve the productivity of their developers.\nThey actually use their own proprietary languages.\nNot only the common languages that are available outside. They are then asking the question, who can I trust to augment their model?\nGive it to me, and I don't.\nReally want to get into all the details of how I might use it, but I want them to provide the technology in this case, Brian. We would work with them to augment the model.\nUsing their language and their data and their code snippets.\nWe would do it in a way that they are completely comfortable, meaning 100%.\nThat leaks nowhere else. They will take back the model. It now becomes an as-a-service deployment in their private cloud infrastructure and.\nWe monetize it as is typical for as-a-service software.\nI'll take another example that we are building out with Dun & Bradstreet and.\nI mentioned that briefly on the call.\nIn that case it is consulting-led. They want to work with consulting to.\nUse watsonx in this case, but to help them create solutions that let their clients get greater insight, aka helps D&B monetize their data better. So in that case it is absolutely consulting-led. I think without consulting we would not have landed that deal.\nLet me go to others because there.\nAre also examples where our consulting team.\nIs using both what's available with Azure.\nOpenAI as an example to go win deals because they have built up the expertise.\nThey've also built up expertise on Amazon's Braket platform and they're going forward with.\nWinning deals on those.\nIn that case, they're coming in with a methodology, with knowledge, with the thousands.\nOf trained consultants who know how to work on those platforms and they're working.\nWith the clients to go do that. I think these are all examples of what's working.\nI think you're trying to also ask.\nIs it going to be consulting or?\nIs it going to be software? Look, we didn't say much.\nOn the call on this topic.\nWe just characterized it as low hundreds of millions of dollars of booking. But in the absence of anything else.\nThink of that as maybe half and half between consulting and software. Which does tell you that a couple of points of growth for both those units came from the generative AI that we've been putting out. And I think that's the best way to think about it in terms of what's happening right now.\nWe are certainly expecting and planning that that will only increase as the quarters go on.\nAll right, so let me now wrap up the call. This Q3 performance reinforced our confidence.\nIn the strategy and in our ability to deliver value to enterprise clients. Today's environment very excited of the opportunities ahead of us.\nI look forward to taking you.\nThrough our continued progress and our view of 2024 in January. Thank you all.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay, Sheila, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, IBM's Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you.\nI'd like to welcome you to IBM's second quarter 2023 earnings presentation. I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow to provide additional information to our investors. Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.\nAdditional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you for being here. Our Q2 results reflect continued solid execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy.\nWe again had strength in our growth vectors of software, consulting, and solid cash generation. Consistent with our financial model.\nClients and partners continue to view technology.\nAs a source of competitive advantage.\nClients turn to us to speed up their transformation journeys, modernize applications, and optimize their business workflows.\nAt the same time, they continue to.\nPrioritize projects that focus on productivity and deliver quick time to value.\nTo seize this opportunity, we are bringing.\nNew innovations to market, expanding strategic partnerships.\nMaking investments in targeted growth markets.\nWhile unlocking value through our productivity initiatives.\nAll of this gives us confidence in.\nOur ability to achieve our full year expectations for revenue and free cash flow.\nWhich remain our two primary areas of focus.\nWe have made progress in our strategy.\nAround hybrid cloud and AI, the two.\nKey drivers of business innovation. Hybrid cloud is the most widespread form of IT architecture. Red Hat OpenShift, our leading container platform based on open source innovations, plays a crucial role in making this possible along.\nWith IBM software and infrastructure.\nOur consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation.\nJourneys and help drive adoption of our technology platforms.\nOur broad ecosystem of partners amplifies our.\nReach and ability to meet current demand.\nLet me highlight a few collaborations from.\nThis past quarter that take advantage of.\nOur platform-centric approach.\nWe are helping Air Canada improve its.\nDigital footprint, including their website, mobile application, and loyalty program. Using a hybrid cloud approach helps Air Canada.\nCanada better connect and tap into their commercial, operational, and financial data.\nWith Diageo, IBM Consulting embarked on a.\nLarge global digital transformation to improve customer.\nSatisfaction, optimize business workflows, and enhance its.\nFinancial performance reporting capabilities.\nWe also forged a strategic partnership with.\nNokia, where Red Hat OpenShift becomes the.\nPreferred platform provider to Nokia's core network applications business.\nThis past quarter we made strategic moves.\nTo bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities with the announcement of our plans.\nTo acquire Apptio, which offers a virtual command center for CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs to manage their technology investments. Apptio's offerings, combined with IBM's IT automation software and our AI capabilities will give clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize their IT environments.\nAI is a transformative technology that has.\nThe potential to unlock tremendous business value.\nAccording to a recent McKinsey study, AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Our focus is on enterprise AI designed.\nTo address these opportunities and solve business problems.\nThe list of use cases is long and includes IT operations, code generation, improved.\nAutomation, customer service, augmenting, HR, predictive maintenance.\nFinancial forecasting, fraud detection, compliance monitoring, security, sales, risk management, and supply chain among others. AI is being infused into our software products. We are already building products that address specific enterprise use cases such as digital.\nLabor with Watson, Orchestrate customer service with.\nWatson Assistant and code generation with Watson Code Assistant. At our Think conference in May, we announced watsonx, our enterprise-ready AI and.\nData platform to help clients and partners.\nCapitalize on the AI opportunity. What's the Next?\nDelivers the value of foundation models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive.\nWe began to roll out watsonx.\nlittle over a week ago, and we.\nAre excited by the client response. To date, the platform has been shaped.\nBy more than 150 businesses across industries.\nFrom telco to banking. Businesses around the world are excited about.\nTapping foundation models and machine learning in one place with their own data to accelerate generative AI workloads. For example, Samsung is exploring generative AI.\nTo deliver unprecedented innovation for clients. Citi is pursuing the potential use of.\nLarge language models for connecting controls to internal processes.\nNatWest is embedding watsonx into its chatbot.\nTo improve customer experience and SAP is.\nIntegrating IBM Watson AI into their solutions.\nIBM is also working with an expanding.\nEcosystem of partners to co-create and.\nInnovate across industries and use cases from space to sports, including work with NASA to build the first foundation model for.\nAnalyzing geospatial data and Wimbledon where watsonx.\nWas used to produce tennis commentary. Large language models are a step change.\nIn the evolution of AI, with more than 80% of enterprises exploring their use.\nWe believe the opportunity for large language.\nModels for enterprises is immense given the existing amount of business data.\nThis includes sensor data, chemistry data, materials.\nData, geospatial data, code, and of course speech.\nBecause enterprise AI draws from both public and private data, it is more effective.\nTrained when companies adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Enterprise AI can also be based on multiple models including public, private, and open source.\nOur watsonx platform takes into account this.\nReality and is differentiated in a few important ways.\nFor instance, instead of relying on a.\nSingle model, watsonx enables companies to leverage the best models to meet their needs.\nWhether they are open source technologies, IBM's.\nModels or those co-created with us.\nAnother fundamental aspect of watsonx is trust, ensuring transparency and bias-free models. In addition, beyond offering companies the capability.\nTo tap into existing AI models, IBM empowers them to create their own. To help clients on this journey, we.\nHave over 20,000 data and AI consultants.\nRecently launched our new Center of Excellence for generative AI.\nAlready staffed with more than 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise. The investments we are making in products.\nSkills will help us to seize the AI opportunity.\nOur path is clear in the same way we built a consulting practice around.\nRed Hat hybrid cloud platform that is now measured in the billions of dollars, we will do the same with AI. And just like OpenShift is the technology platform at the heart of our hybrid.\nCloud capabilities, watsonx will be the core.\nTechnology platform for our AI capabilities.\nwatsonx is just one of many new technology innovations. Shortly after previewing watsonx at our Think.\nConference at the Red Hat Summit, we introduced OpenShift AI, which is a unified solution to train, serve, monitor, and manage the lifecycle of AI models and applications.\nWe also unveiled IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh, a SaaS solution that streamlines application-centric connectivity for edge, hybrid, and multi-cloud.\nEnvironments to help clients with their sustainability agendas.\nWe launched our AI-powered cloud-based.\nTool that helps clients track their greenhouse gas emissions for cloud workloads.\nAs an example of how we.\nContinue to push the boundaries of innovation.\nIBM recently demonstrated using error-mitigating techniques, quantum computers can produce results at a scale of 100+ qubits. This is a significant breakthrough that firmly.\nPuts us on a path towards building.\nPractical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials.\nLet me conclude by reiterating our confidence in our strategy and execution.\nIt is clear that the work we have done to better align IBM to the needs of our clients is paying off.\nThe momentum in our business and continued focus on productivity position us to achieve.\nOur full year expectations and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to Jim who will delve deeper into our performance and expectations.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the key financial highlights of the Q2. We delivered $15.5 billion in revenue, $2.4 billion of operating pre-tax income, $2.18 of operating earnings per share, and through the first half, nearly $3.5 billion of free cash flow. In the Q2, we had modest revenue growth at constant currency, and that includes over a point of impact from the businesses we divested last year. Currency rates continue to be a headwind to growth with dollars strengthening over the last 90 days. Currency impacted our reported revenue growth by about 80 basis points, which is about a half a point worse than what spot rates suggested in April. As is typical, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue performance was again led by software and consulting.\nThese are growth factors that together represent about 3/4 of IBM's revenue and contribute to a solid base of recurring revenue and profit. Software revenue was up 8% with good growth across both hybrid platform and solutions led by Red Hat, data and AI, and transaction processing. IBM Consulting revenue growth of 6% was also broad-based with growth across all three lines of business, and geographies. Our infrastructure revenue in any quarter reflects product cycle dynamics. Infrastructure revenue was down 14%. This, as expected, had a disproportionate impact to IBM's overall revenue growth this quarter given the very successful launch of z16 in the second quarter last year. Looking at the two-year compounded growth rate, infrastructure revenue was up. Turning to our profit metrics, operating gross margin expanded 140 basis points driven by our portfolio mix and productivity.\nWe had good performance this quarter with gross margin improvements in every reportable segment. Our operating pre-tax margin was down 70 basis points. Last year we had a gain of about $230 million from the sale of our healthcare software assets. Without the year-to-year impact of the divestiture gains, our operating pre-tax margin was up 70 basis points. This is a better indication of our ongoing operational performance.\nLet me comment on a couple of items within our expense profile that impacted our pre-tax income performance.\nAs we discussed in the last couple of earnings calls, we addressed the remaining stranded cost from our portfolio actions resulting in a higher level of workforce rebalancing activity this year, about $115 million in the quarter. Workforce rebalancing impacted our year-to-year pre-tax margin expansion by another 60 basis points, and then currency remained a year-to-year headwind not only to revenue, but also to our expense and pretax profit. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $150 million, and operating PTI margin by about 80 basis points year to year. As I've discussed in the past, this disproportionately impacts our product-based businesses. We have good momentum. In our underlying operational profit performance, I mentioned a strong business mix, but we're also making progress on our productivity initiatives.\nWe're digitally transforming IBM as client zero, simplifying workflows and deploying AI across our processes from IT operations to HR to source to pay. The productivity benefits free up spend for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion.\nTurning to free cash flow, we generated $2.1 billion in the quarter and nearly $3.5 billion in the first half. This first half performance is up over $100 million year to year and keeps us on track to our full year expectation. Growth is driven by the cash from our profit performance, working capital efficiencies, and lower payments for structural actions. This was mitigated by higher performance-based compensation payments given last year's strong results and higher cash taxes.\nIn terms of cash usage through the first half, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and spent about $350 million to acquire six companies. Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Apptio, which complements and advances our IT automation capabilities.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we continue to have very strong liquidity position with over $16 billion of cash. That's down over a billion dollars since March and up $7.5 billion since December. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was over $57 billion, which is up $6.5 billion from year end. You'll recall earlier in the year we were opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities as well as capital allocation.\nTurning to the segment's software revenue, growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both hybrid platform and solutions, and transaction processing grew as clients leverage our hybrid cloud and AI platform capabilities. This performance again reflects growth across both our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, as well as transactional revenue. In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 7% fueled by growth in Red Hat, data and AI, and automation. Our hybrid platform and solutions ARR is now over $13.6 billion and up 7%, reflecting the importance of our strategic offerings with our clients. Red Hat revenue grew 11%. OpenShift, our leading hybrid cloud platform, grew more than 30% in the quarter and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Ansible also delivered double digit growth and gained market share this quarter.\nIn Automation, revenue was up 2% reflecting growth across integration, application servers, and business automation as clients drive enhanced business value through productivity and performance optimization.\nData and AI revenue was up 11%. The broad-based growth included areas like data management and business analytics, meeting enterprise needs for data visualization, organization analysis, and insights as the underpinnings for AI workloads. Security revenue declined 1%. We delivered growth in security software driven by data security with Guardium Insights. This was more than offset by declines in security services this quarter.\nIn transaction processing, revenue grew 10% off of an easier compare last year. The increase in Z Systems installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and strong software renewal rates reflect the importance of Z Systems platform in a hybrid cloud environment. These dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue opportunity again this quarter. Putting this together with price increases, we had strong performance in transaction processing moving to profit for software segment. Our pre-tax margin was up a half a point while absorbing over a point of impact from currency. We delivered operating leverage given both the revenue scale and mix this quarter. Consulting revenue was up 6%. In April, we discussed that we were seeing sustained demand for larger transformations that delivered meaningful ROI.\nAt the same time, other projects considered to be more discretionary were being delayed predominantly in the United States. The Q2 client buying behavior played out much in the same way. Our signings were solid up over 20% with double-digit growth in both large and small engagements. This takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.1 over the last 12 months. We addressed continued demand for technology-driven transformations as clients prioritize projects that drive cost savings and increase productivity. Turning to our lines of business and consulting, growth across our service offerings was broad-based. Business transformation grew 5%, driven by data and technology transformations including AI, and analytics-focused projects. Digital transformations continue to be underpinned by clients embracing a hybrid cloud strategy.\nTechnology consulting grew 5% and application operations grew 8% as we again saw strength in cloud based application services across development, modernization, and management.\nContributing to growth across the business. Our strategic partnerships grew signings and revenue double digits with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. Our Red Hat practice also grew signings and revenue double digits. We have an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $2 billion. Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pretax margins 180 basis points. Our margin expansion is a reflection of the pricing and productivity actions we've taken, more than offsetting the increased labor costs, and investments.\nTurning to the infrastructure segment revenue was down 14%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. This impacted both hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support. Within hybrid infrastructure, Z Systems revenue declined 30%. We've wrapped on strong revenue performance last year, up 77% when z16 launched in a seasonally strong quarter. Through the first five quarters of availability our revenue is well ahead of prior cycles. z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilience, security, and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. For example, clients are adopting IBM z16 and the Telum Processor as the foundation for real-time AI insights across significant volumes of data. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 6%. Let me remind you we're wrapping on strong growth last year, up 17%, driven by strength in storage and Power10 high-end systems.\nMoving to infrastructure profit, we expanded gross margins 200 basis points while pretax margin was down 40 basis points, including about a point of impact from currency.\nNow that I've gone through the segment results, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our first half performance with momentum in our growth vectors of software, and consulting, and a solid recurring revenue base driven by our high value software. We're delivering strong gross margin performance with growth across our segments driven by portfolio mix and productivity. Our overall year to year profit dynamics, as expected, reflect the impact of last year's divestiture. As we look to the full year of 2023, we're holding our view of the year on our two primary metrics, revenue growth, and free cash flow. We see constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5, and we expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which I'll remind you is up over a billion dollars year-to-year.\nLet me comment on a few items. Within these full-year expectations, we expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about a half a point year-to-year, driven by a combination of product mix and progress on our productivity initiatives. That's consistent with our view 90 days ago. And in line with our model, we're also maintaining our view of our tax rate for the year, which is in the mid- to high-teens range. And then finally, while there has been some volatility in currency rates over the last couple of weeks, at current spot rates, currency translation is still expected to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the wrap on last year's hedging gains, which is about a point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion.\nIn terms of segment dynamics in software, we had a good first half and now expect revenue growth at the high end of software's mid-single-digit model. This is all-in including acquisitions; our revenue growth drives operating leverage with software pre-tax margin expected to expand, a point and a half to two points year-to-year. In consulting, we've repositioned our business to address today's clients' needs. What we saw in the second quarter didn't change our view of the year. We continue to expect consulting revenue growth in a range of 6% to 8 and to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least a point. Then for infrastructure, as I described in the past, revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics.\nIn Q2, we wrapped on the z16 introduction in a seasonally strong quarter for the year. As you expect, 2023 infrastructure revenue was decline impacting IBM's overall revenue growth by over a point. We continue to expect pre-tax margin in the low teens. Our expectations for 2023 reflect a higher growth, higher value business with strong cash generation. What we have referred to as today's IBM. The analyst estimates also reflect these dynamics, and as we look at Q3, the average of analyst estimates look reasonable.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our first half performance and it keeps us on track to deliver revenue growth, expand margin, and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A. Patricia, let's get started.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we'll begin the question-and answer session of the conference. To ask a question, please press star 1 and record your name clearly. If you need to withdraw your question, press star two. Again, to ask a question, please press star one. Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity ResearchAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much. Arvind, you noted some initial traction around AI, and I was wondering, you guys have made a lot of major announcements around, wondering if you can share some thoughts on AI monetization in the short to medium term and any quantification, if possible, either in terms of dollars or growth rates or 2023, 2024 would be helpful. If I could, Jim, you saw very strong transaction processing growth. You noted a few different items there. I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that is structural versus cyclical. And if transaction processing is growing this fast, does that drive upside to software revenue for the year or are there other areas that are offsetting? And if you could just reiterate if Red Hat, you still expect that to grow 11 to 13.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you so much.\nWamzi.\nThank you for the question.\nAs you noted, I am very.\nExcited by our progress on AI and what it is going to do for our clients, most importantly, and then return, of course, for us as we monetize it. Our monetization is largely going to be.\nThrough consulting and software, and I'll explain.\nThat infrastructure will benefit, but I would not call that a direct monetization route.\nLet me start with consulting. If you noticed, I talked about, and.\nJim talked about what we have done with hybrid cloud, aka OpenShift consulting, where we began with this journey in 2019.\nOur book of business was, to be.\nPrecise and to round it out, zero. In the first year we signed about $1 billion of business, and at this point we have inception to date.\nSigned $9 billion with an annual run.\nRate of $2 billion in consulting. I would tell you, and expect that we'll play out AI in a similar way.\nI hesitate to call it anything else until we get six months or so.\nDown the road, in which case we'll have more knowledge.\nNow, on the software side, we are.\nVery, very excited by the initial reaction to the watsonx platform, the number of projects we have going on, the client interest.\nIt really is something which we are.\nVery, very pleased by. What's a model to think of it on?\nAs I think about how OpenShift, which was a Red Hat product, came in in 2019, it grew, literally doubled each.\nYear for the first four years, and at this point the revenue is about 10x of what it was when it came in.\nRight now we have quantified it.\nAt $1.1 billion on our annualized run rate basis.\nThat gives you a sense of.\nThe excitement we have around these projects.\nThese technologies and what it could do.\nFor us as you begin to go forward now.\nThird and most important, I don't.\nWant to quantify it, is the fact that I will infuse in models every single product we have, whether it's sustainability.\nWhether it's our database products, whether it's our consulting projects, whether it's inside the.\nMainframe with the Telum, but I'm not including those in those first two categories. With that, let me give it to Jim for the TPS question.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Arvind, and thanks, Wamsi, for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our overall software performance here in the Q2, accelerating to 8% at constant currency, and it was pretty pervasive, both acceleration in the hybrid platform and solution, and to your question, transaction processing. You get underneath the performance, double digit in Red Hat, double digit in data and AI, and double digit in our high-value transaction processing business overall, which, by the way, gives us the confidence exiting the first half to raise our guidance on software overall to the high end of our mid single-digit model. Now, to your question about transaction processing. We constantly talk about on these calls the value of TP in our business model. It's a value vector, 30% of software. It's a tremendous source of profit and cash that gives us financial flexibility to reinvest for growth overall.\nIt also provides a tremendous incumbency position for our IBM multiplier effect. You know, we entered the year, Arvind and I talked about, we saw the inflection shift in TP in 2023, and that was predicated on the successful mainframe programs that we've had over the last two. By the way, the last program, we're up 2x our installed MIPS capacity. We have a much more extended opportunity base to go get those strong renewal rates overall. We said from a model perspective, we saw the inflection shift versus being down mid single digit, which was a tremendous drain on us. We saw low single digit growth. Now, on top of that, just given the highly inflationary environment we talked about, we were going to get disproportional price in 2023. Call that, I don't know, two, three, four points, somewhere in that ballpark.\nWhen you look at our first half performance, our first half, we're up 8%, by the way. Our first half last year was relatively flat. It's our easier compare. We have to acknowledge it's easier compare. We're going to enter a different, more difficult compare in the second half. That eight points of growth overall, I would say, you know, once you normalize for the easier compare, we can grow low single digit on a sustainable basis. This year, just given the differentiated price position, we said we'd grow mid single digit. We feel very confident exiting first half.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks Wamsi. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is from Amit Daryanani Evercore. You may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Diretor, Evercore\n\nYep.\nThanks for taking my question. I guess I was hoping we'd spend a bit of time on the consulting side, and growth did decelerate there.\nLittle bit from 8% Q1 to 6%.\nI'd love to understand how did that.\n6% growth in consulting in Q2 stack.\nUp versus your internal expectations, given the decelerations in June.\nMaybe just talk about what gives you.\nConfidence that the growth rate holds up.\nIn that 6% to 8 range for.\nThe back half of the year when.\nSome of your peers have actually talked about that market decelerating a bit. Thank you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nThanks, Amit. I'll take this one. We're actually pleased with our consulting performance. Remember, you dial back 90 days ago and we saw a real change in buying behavior, particularly in the United States, around discretionary project-based activity that slowed down in the month of March, and that impacted our backlog realization in the quarter. We actually posted relatively strong growth, 8%, in the first quarter. We had mid-teens, if I remember correctly, signings growth. When we look at second quarter, we have not seen any substantive change in client buying behavior at all. I think that's actually a positive indicator. We didn't see it permeate across other markets around the world. You know, clients like us. You know, internally I'm focused every single day on getting productivity, cost, quick payback, ROI, and our clients are looking at that.\nYou know, on top of that 6% growth here in the second Q2, I think it should be noted we delivered very strong signings growth that was pervasive, both large deal, small deal. We see continued momentum where client demand is there, where there's a value to clients overall, and how we differentiated ourselves. I would argue we're gaining share. We grew 24% in signings in the second quarter, and that was driven by areas that you would quite expect around digital transformation, application modernization, data and technology. AI, by the way, grew 50% signings in the Q1. Arvind's opening volley about AI and how we're going to monetize this is early green shoots on some of these things. We exited the quarter with about.\nYou know, 1.11 book-to-bill, by the way.\nThat's the strongest book-to-bill we've had in quite some time now. That positions us well for the second half. We got very good strategic partnership velocity, we got very good Red Hat book of business growing strong double digit. We're going to continue to monitor this client buying behavior on backlog realization. That's the critical piece. By the way, our erosion, we have not seen any change or inflection shift in erosion. We're positioned well for the second.\nHalf, and that gave us confidence in.\nOur six to eight, eight maintaining guidance for the year.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks, Amit. Sue, let's take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next is Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nYes, thank you. I just wanted to clarify when you talked about feeling comfortable with Q3 estimates, was that both the revenue and an EPS statement? My question is on software. I think you were looking for 200 basis point margin improvement for the year, and now you're saying 150 to 200. Can you speak to that? Also, when we look at the improved software revenue growth, is that just improvement in transaction processing because you were way above your forecast in Apptio, or is there something beyond that? Related to that, are you modeling any substantive revenue from AI in consulting or in software this year? Why would that not impact your outlook if you were? Thank you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nOkay, Toni, thank you. I'll take the first two or three or four of your questions, and then I think Arvind can talk about the AI piece overall. When you look at our software margin overall, first of all, we're taking our full year guidance up on revenue to the high end of our model. That's about a point raise year over year. By the way, that's all in, as we stated in prepared remarks, including how we're very excited about the Apptio acquisition overall. That raise in guidance, I think, is a reflection of the pervasive performance we've seen in the first half that we feel pretty confident in. You know, we entered—let's dial back. We entered the year, we said mid single digit, we were coming off a peak ELA.\nWe said we'd get 5 to 6 points of growth out of annuity, and we would have about a 1 point headwind on transactional. We had a pretty solid first quarter, delivering above our model. We continued and accelerated that in Q2. By the way, it's both transaction processing, hybrid platform, and solution overall. When you look at it, we see one, yes, Apptio, very excited. It's a high growth company, high recurring revenue, and a highly profitable company. We expect, just given normal customary regulations of closing, we probably assume sometime early fourth quarter. That's about a half a point in that raise.\nThe remaining half a point is going to be solid mid single digit growth on TP to my answer to Amit, and then third is we actually exited our first half with very solid transactional growth, albeit we do understand we're going to wrap in fourth quarter on a very strong ELA cycle. The first half, we're seeing very strong clothing upsell that's in the mid 20% year-over-year on those expiring ELAs through the first half. I think it's all three pieces overall. I think I covered both the revenue piece. On the margin, Toni, that is really just the dilution effect in the first quarter of Apptio. We called about 200 basis points for the year. Now we're putting Apptio in. You know, we're somewhere between 150 basis points and 200 basis points.\nI'll remind you we expect a very quick accretive business as we go forward just given their profitable overall. I'll turn it over to Arvind on the AI.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nYeah, thanks Jim.\nTony, I'll comment quickly on the color on revenue from AI both in software and consulting.\nAs I said in consulting, we're.\nExpecting a number of projects to get signed. By the way, as Jim mentioned, some of that is getting baked in.\nYou're seeing that in the strong signings that we have in consulting.\nQ2 with the over 20% growth in signings, and a lot of that was indeed data and AI consulting projects, ditto. And software.\nI just note that we had double.\nDigit growth in the data and AI.\nSubsegment of software and no doubt that.\nSome of that is colored by clients doing more around AI with us than they have historically. We expect to see it.\nI do want us to be sort of all in all in with 2023, including the color. We see software at the high end.\nOf our model, we see consulting as in the range that Jim just laid out. While we are very excited about it, we see a lot of traction on AI.\nIt is included in the estimates that we just gave.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nThank you very much.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nArvind, I'm wondering, can you talk?\nI know you haven't launched it globally, but I'm sure everybody's having conversations right now. What is the interest level and understanding of AI by geography? How do you think that sort of plays out and rolls through?\nJust as a follow up.\nTo the commentary on Apptio, I wondered if you could talk a bit more about what were sort of the key drivers of that acquisition, what KPIs we should watch for. I'm also curious as to how the $450 billion of anonymized data that you're gaining with that, how do you think you'll leverage that within your foundational models?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nThank you. Thanks, Shannon. Great question.\nWhen I look at AI by.\nGeography at one sort of simple level, I would tell you that over the last six months, the interest in AI.\nSpans across all markets, all industries. It is an international phenomenon, not.\nConfined to the US now, we got to dig under it then. If I look at the maturity of.\nClients to actually have their enterprise ready.\nTo embrace AI, to be able to.\nInteract with their clients, their employees, that does vary. I have to acknowledge it. The North American market is probably the.\nMost further ahead on this.\nI think Western Europe comes second, likely.\nTogether with some of the more advanced and developed markets in South America, following that is Asia and all of what would be called the global South.\nJapan has a strong interest, but they.\nTend to be cautious on adopting technology.\nNot necessarily in experimenting.\nIn experimenting, they'll be pretty quick, and then it'll go into South Asia, where always, I think, technology adoption tends to.\nLag by a year or two behind the West.\nThat gives you some sense of that.\nThat said, every government, every enterprise, every CEO, every CIO that I talk.\nTo wants to talk about AI, what it can do to their company, what should it be in their country.\nAll of the questions around sovereignty.\nModels and data, and privacy, and not depending only on a few international players.\nComes into the conversation.\nThat's why we talk a lot about private models and models that can be left behind with a client, because.\nThat is coming up more and more.\nAnd so that, I hope, gives you some color on how this is going to play out. Coming to the next part of your question on Apptio, look, the key drivers of this acquisition are pretty straightforward.\nWhen we look at and talk to.\nCIOs, CFOs, CEOs, they're all getting worried about their spend across the hybrid landscape. What do I spend on my first public cloud? What is it on my second? What is it on a SaaS property?\nWhat am I spending on my own data centers? So to give people a virtual cockpit that really lets them span across this.\nNot just in terms of the third party spend, but also the people and the process spend is something they're all deeply, deeply interested in. More than a few CEOs I've talked to said it really gives them a handle on what's going on and where the money is being spent.\nThat, I think, is going to play in right away. You went right to the second value prop. With that spend data coming in across.\nEnterprises, the aggregate anonymized across the asset.\nIs the $450 billion. Now helping people benchmark, who does this better than you?\nWho does this process better?\nWho can do this with fewer total?\nSpend on a public or a private resource is interesting to people because benchmarks.\nIs a great way to guide oneself to better performance.\nWe expect that over time we'll be able to monetize that.\nInto a large language model or a foundation model and be able to give people even better predictors.\nOf where they can take their spend to.\nThat's why we are so excited about it. I think the last part of your question was KPIs look as we look to get Apptio much more international while our footprint is, I'll call it maybe 2/3, 1/3 outside the US and in the US they're almost the inverse. So as we can put it into our distribution channel, that will be one big expansion as we go over the next year or so. The second one is we believe we have a great chance to also increase the penetration in our larger clients.\nSo those are two big metrics. While we continue the success and the.\nGrowth rate they've had using their own channels.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you, Shannon. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next is Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nEric Woodring\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question, Arvind. I'd love to dig into how you guys are thinking about M and A today. Obviously you announced the Apptio deal a few weeks ago that largely probably takes transformational M and A off the table. But you obviously still have some additional dry powder to make other acquisitions. So you know, maybe if you could talk about what your appetite is for further M&A. Are you thinking about any other end markets or solutions you'd target now? Is valuation becoming more restrictive for you? You know, maybe said differently. Just what's your message on M&A today?\nPost Apptio, thanks so much,\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nEric.\nSo I might sound somewhat repetitive to those of you who heard me over the past two years on this topic.\nSo if I just sort of maybe.\nJust step back and say taking unusual actions off the table for a moment.\nWe had talked about a total fin.\nFlex, let's call it circa $20 billion over a three-year period that includes.\nThe ability to raise additional debt if we so desired.\nWe've been spending circa about $3 billion a year for the last couple. So that tells you what's the capability and the flexibility that we have.\nYou asked about valuations, and I hope.\nMy answer there tells you that we are always on the lookout, and I'll get to which categories because you asked that. Also, on valuations, I wouldn't call it so much that today's is restrictive.\nWhat I could say is that while.\nSome of, at least, the reports I was reading were talking about valuations perhaps coming down in multiples over this year.\nIt doesn't seem that that's the case. They've not gone up in any kind.\nOf tremendous way, but they have not come down.\nBut the market is what the market is. So we find properties that meet our criteria.\nMy criteria are pretty straightforward.\nDoes it align with our strategy and?\nI'll call those areas out in a moment.\nDoes it actually give us synergy, meaning can we the combined entity grow faster than the individuals could before?\nRight.\nJust put it in very financial terms.\nIf it is larger, it has to be accretive.\nAnd by larger I mean it's not a tuck-in, meaning it's not a few hundred million. It's larger than that, then it's got to get accretive, let's say within two years at the latest. So if it meets those criteria it's certainly an attractive proposition.\nThe areas we are in, we don't.\nWant to open up more strategic lanes, so to speak.\nOur areas are hybrid cloud, data and.\nAI, automation, cyber, and those consulting properties which in turn help these.\nThat's kind of the lanes we're in.\nIf I look at the latest one, Apptio, I'd say it kind of hits three out of my four.\nIt hits hybrid cloud because it helps you deploy those.\nIt is a big data and AI property because that's what they use, and it is automation because it takes out.\nHuman labor costs from any of those processes. So it was actually a very, very good fit.\nYou know, if any of you have suggestions for similar things, we are all ears, and you can certainly write to me.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks, Eric. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next is David Grossman with Stifel. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Grossman\n\nNanaging Director of Research, Stifel\n\nThank you.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity ResearchAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nArvind, you spoke extensively about the favorable impact of pricing on the transaction processing portfolio. What have you learned from repricing that portfolio, and what other segments of your business could potentially benefit from similar actions? Sorry to violate the one question rule, but Jim, I just want a clarification. My recollection is that you had about $500 million of working capital tailwind factored into the free cash flow guide. Just want to make sure I got that right.\nThat's the same.\nThanks.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nSo, David, let me address the first.\nPart of your question on pricing.\nLook, I'd like to be careful. TP certainly benefited this year, but the.\nBiggest part of the benefit has been the mainframe cycle and the capacity and value that our clients see. Yes. Was there a price increase given the labor inflation of 2022 and some ongoing in 2023 given the strong dollar?\nEffectively, there was pricing increase because of.\nThose factors and that got taken well by the market because of the value they see on that.\nWould I expect to see similar pricing on TP?\nAnd then I'll come to other parts of both consulting and software. I doubt, David, that it will be on the same range because definitely I think we would all agree 2022 had.\nAmid high inflation and because our costs.\nGo together with the labor and the dollar. I don't think it will be as strong as that.\nBut I would expect maybe moderate increases.\nBased on just the pricing and tp. Now, consulting has also got both labor and inflation built in.\nWhen we are seeing 6, 8.\n10% increases in labor cost, it is, I think, appropriate to be able to.\nPass some of that on, albeit with a lag. You heard Jim talk in his.\nPrepared remarks about that. That is some of what is coming through in consulting.\nIf there remains underlying labor inflation, I.\nFully expect to be able to pass it on again with a bit of a lag to clients in consulting because.\nOtherwise that's not a healthy business to go run. I think on the rest of software except TP, I would expect that as.\nLabor inflation is there, those elements do.\nCome in effectively on pricing, renewal rates, and so on. But I'll also say it's a competitive.\nMarket and you have to remain competitively.\nPriced to where the others are.\nI would say it's in those two: TP, consulting, and then in other.\nElements of the portfolio that pricing can play a role.\nBy the way, our renewal rates are a very strong indication that these are.\nPortfolios that provide tremendous value to our clients. But we remain competitive on price.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nYeah, I mean our strategy overall has always been around pricing for value. Right. But David, just to put it in perspective, you know, last year we all dealt with a very highly inflationary environment, and we're still dealing with a very highly inflationary environment that was somewhere, anywhere, what, three, four, five points above history overall. That's kind of what we've been talking about is a disproportional price in 23. You're not going to get that every single year to Arvind's point. But you know, I've always said pricing optimization is a direct correlation to the value and differentiation you offer to clients. You got to bring value to clients or they're not going to accept the pricing. And we've been seeing good take up with our mission critical transaction processing. Arvind talked about the human capital based business, the consulting, et cetera.\nBut just quickly to wrap on your second question, David, we said entering the year, remember we came off of December where we had a shortfall leaving much more on the balance sheet than collected in working capital. Working capital for the year is probably somewhere around $400 to 500 million like you said. And that's a tailwind coming off of last year. The remaining piece of the $1.2 billion of free cash flow growth year-ove-year is the fundamental improvement in the operating discipline of our revenue, operating margin, cash, and profit.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThanks, David. Let's see if we can squeeze two more in. Go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. You may go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi. Many thanks for the question. Arvind, I wanted to direct this to you if I could. You've talked about the success you've had even at these early stages of signing new AI offerings in the consulting side of the business. How are you thinking about the supply side of the business? And what I mean by that is as you look out over time, the software development process as you talk about down in Orlando, is going to become much more efficient. And so if your consulting business is really a seat based model that drives revenue and if those developers are increasing productivity by, I don't know, 30%, 40% because it's in AI, presumably clients will want that back. So how do you think about the disinflationary forces associated with Gen AI on the delivery side of the model which is, I think, separate and distinct from.\nThe opportunities associated with new demand sources. And Jim, if I just sneak one in to you too. If you could talk about the total MIPS growth, not just the cycle growth but the total MIPS growth that you've recently experienced and we'll look at over the next couple years, just trying to understand what the pricing increase, you know, how that may, how you may be able to use pricing on TP to leverage that mix. That's it for me. Many thanks.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM",
    "content2": "So Keith, let me address the first.\nPart of your question.\nSo if I look at it in.\nThe short term, let's just walk through what does the consulting team actually do?\nThey spend a lot of time up front with the business side going through.\nBusiness process processes, worrying about how to optimize business processes, cutting across silos, coming up with data architectures which could help the business, helping the business decide how they're going to roll forward.\nAll of that, to be candid, holds even in a world of Gen AI.\nAssuming it gets to perfection.\nNow let's get to the next level.\nA lot of what our teams do, and it is perhaps unique to us.\nWe tend to work on much more mission critical systems. We tend to work much more on.\nThings which are fundamental to the business.\nAround financial supply chain, cyber resilience, and so on. Will Gen AI and large language models have an impact? Absolutely.\nI would tell you that if I look over a five to 10 year horizon, I would agree with you that for that second part of consulting, not.\nThe first, I would agree and expect.\nTo see a 30% productivity. Now, I would tell you that in that time frame, I would believe that for IBM that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. Why?\nAbsolutely disinflationary.\nBut if we share that with the client, that means we can win more work and the total labor pool we need to drive an amount of revenue is lower because there is obviously value in the technology that we are using, be it for test automation or code writing.\nMaybe I could be a little.\nBit boastful, I'll use that word, Keith, and talk about one example that we have.\nSo we wrote a code assistant for.\nAnsible and it is part of our watsonx family.\nThat code assistant for Ansible can help our Ansible developers, which is used by.\nI think it's the most widely adopted language for IT deployment, get up to 60% more productive.\nNow that's one piece of it. IT deployment overall, I would then say, gets probably somewhere between 10% and 30% overall productivity.\nSo that's why I think that 30% number is a good one to keep in mind.\nBut to go across all the environments, COBOL, Java, Python, AI models, that's going.\nTo take a few years before our clients get the full confidence around that topic.\n\nJames Kavanaugh\n\nSVP and CFO, IBM\n\nKeith, thanks for the question on mainframe. Overall pretty pleased given where we're at. GA plus four quarters in. So we wrapped on last year. Remember we talked a lot last year. We came out with, unlike the prior programs, we came out with a Q2 launch in a highly seasonal transactional quarter, and we grew 77% last year. Overall we wrapped on that this year. I think we printed down 30% here in the Q2. But two-year CGR so far, five quarters in, you know, it's the most successful program in mainframe that we've had. Now why is it important? Yes, definitely the value we deliver to clients, whether it's embedded AI, it's scale, cyber resilience, security, cloud-native development. But it's important internally to us because it's a platform that drives a multiplier effect.\nTo your question around transaction processing, and we've been talking about this 2x installed MIPS shift MIPS capacity over the last program that was actually the Z15 program over Z14, you know, because we're only five quarters into Z16. But if you fast forward right now into Z16 five quarters in, we're, you know, 120% to 130 up on installed MIPS capacity already. And you know, the tail of that usually happens in the outer path of the next three or four quarters before we come out with the new one.\nWe feel pretty good.\nAnd that's why we had the confidence, entering this year, Arvind and I, to take up the transaction processing model to actually low single digit growth from being down mid single. So we see that continuing. Thanks for your question.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nOkay, we're at the top of the hour, but let's squeeze in one more question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Ben Reitzis with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Thanks for sneaking me in there.\nI wanted to ask you, Arvind, in layman's terms with regard to AI. I find a lot of investors want to understand IBM's place better. In terms of AI where you have your consulting and then hand it off to software, are you finding that IBM is well positioned to help people pick the right models to train to lower their cost? What is it about IBM with the consulting and software that has your unique place set for growth and some of the optimism that you sound like you have heading into next year?\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nChairman and CEO, IBM\n\nBen, thank you for the question and I deeply appreciate your asking it in that form. Look, when we look at, let me start with our extreme advantage.\nWhen clients have data that they'd like to train models on and they absolutely.\nWant to preserve the intellectual property in that data. They do not want the learnings. I mean, I can go through three forms.\nAlmost everyone will say, look, we're not.\nGoing to take your data and give it to anybody in direct form.\nOkay, next, how about learnings.\nThe model itself from the data?\nDo you use that implicitly or explicitly?\nOr not at all?\n3. The very fact that you're asking a.\nCertain kind of question can in turn reveal information.\nI'll use the word from my college.\nTraining of side channel information, I'm sure that all of you also understand what that word could imply.\nSo for people who are worried about.\nAll that, which we estimate to be at least 30% of the overall AI.\nOpportunity, think about a bank dealing with regulatory compliance. Think about a pharma company dealing with.\nReports to the FDA.\nThink about a healthcare company worried about some kind of side effect on something. Think about a chemicals company worrying about.\nTheir proprietary formulations, not just what's in the literature. So as you go through all of these, there are lots and lots of examples where people want to try train models.\nMaybe it's a refinement of a larger known model. So to your point on other models, and I'll come to that, so we.\nFind that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are the questions that people are asking us.\nNext, a number of people are correctly. They have great models, they're great for.\nBig public consumption, they're great because everybody.\nKind of has the same need for productivity. But there is also a world right now from the partners we work.\nThere's already over 100,000 open source models in addition to the models that we IBM provide.\nHow do you pick from those models?\nWhich one is appropriate?\nWe have taken a conscious strategy that we are not going to constrain the model that our clients want.\nSo on our consulting teams, we will work with all the models, our own, open source, and other models so we can help our clients decide on which is the best one for them.\nLook, 30 years of being here has.\nShown us that trying to help the.\nClients navigate through the extreme complexity of.\nThis world is helpful to us, and we can become much better advisors and gain revenue in the process.\nSo hopefully that gives you a sense.\nOf how we are going to win here and get our fair share of this market.\nSo, given that we just passed the.\nTop of the hour, let me wrap up the call.\nWe are in a really good position.\nAs we enter the second half of the year, solutions meet today's client needs, new innovation.\nWe are bringing to market, and there is momentum and productivity in our underlying operations.\nAs always, we need to execute, too.\nCapture the opportunity in front of us. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of Investor Relations, IBM\n\nThank you.\nSue, let me turn it back to.\nYou to close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.\nNow I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, International Business Machines Corp.\n\nThank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation. I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nTo provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue growth are at constant currency. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation posted to our investor website.\nFinally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. More information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board\n\nThank you for joining us. Our first quarter results demonstrate that clients continue to turn to IBM to help them address today's business needs while positioning them for the future. We had a good start to the year, with mid-single-digit revenue growth at constant currency, in line with our midterm model and growth in free cash flow. Performance was led by software and consulting as clients continue to accelerate their digital transformations, modernize their applications, automate their workflows and create flexible and secure hybrid cloud environments.\nMore recently, clients are prioritizing digital transformation projects that focus on cost takeout, productivity and quick returns. While demand for our offerings that support these priorities remains solid, we are seeing some deceleration in consulting from the previous robust growth levels, especially in the United States.\nGlobally, our clients continue to see technology as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Technology helps them scale and enhance productivity, which is especially important in the face of inflation, demographic shifts, cybersecurity, supply chain issues and sustainability goals. All of this supports our revenue growth expectations for the year. Our focus remains on revenue growth and free cash flow.\n90 days ago, I shared that in 2023, we continue to unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships and put more investment in specific growth markets. Productivity has always been an important part of our business model. It frees up spending and increases financial flexibility to enable investments. We have started to see some of these pay back in our results, which gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year free cash flow objectives.\nLet me spend a few minutes on the progress we have made in the execution of our strategy. Our focus is on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, the 2 most influential technologies for business. In tandem, these technologies drive both business outcomes and innovation. Hybrid cloud is now the most prominent form of IT architecture, and our approach is platform-centric. Red Hat OpenShift is the leading container platform, enabling clients to leverage the latest innovations in open source software. IBM's software and infrastructure have been tailored for this platform. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation processes.\nIn the first quarter, we co-created with more clients to unlock business value from a hybrid cloud approach. We are working with Virgin Money to migrate their credit card service to the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. They will also leverage IBM's consulting capabilities to create new digital customer experiences. For the Boston Red Sox, we are collaborating with Wasabi Technologies, leveraging hybrid cloud technologies to analyze key data sources that improve the club's operations.\nThe second element of our strategy is top of mind for a lot of clients: artificial intelligence. AI is projected to add $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Keep in mind that AI for business is different than AI for consumers, given their need for more accurate results, trusted data and governance tools. AI techniques such as foundation models, large language models and generative AI give businesses the ability to create 100 AI models from a single data set. Early cloud engagements experienced a 70% faster time to value. That is why we are seeing a lot more interest from business and using AI to boost productivity and reduce costs. Productivity gains will come from enterprises turning their workflows into simpler automated processes with AI.\nTo achieve this, we are collaborating with companies like Citi to enhance their internal audit and compliance processes through AI. J.B. Hunt Transport use our Turbonomic AI-powered resourcing and automation engine to optimize their cloud environment. This helped reduce infrastructure refresh costs by 75%. This is a great example of the work we're doing in IT operations. In other areas such as customer care, we are automating hundreds of thousands of call center responses with AI with more than 90% accuracy and greater levels of customer satisfaction.\nIn cybersecurity, our elite defense teams are deploying AI to defend against criminals in real time. In digital labor, we are helping finance, accounting and HR teams save thousands of hours by automating what used to be labor-intensive data entry tasks. To bring our hybrid cloud and AI strategy to market, our partner ecosystem continues to play a critical role. We expanded our partnership with Adobe to help marketing and creative organizations make the production of content easier. IBM and EY announced a collaboration using IBM software and EY's sustainability consulting practice to help companies operationalize decarbonization action plans.\nJuniper Networks and Nokia also recently expanded their collaboration around IBM's network intelligence and automation solutions to monetize and optimize investments in networks more effectively. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. A good example of this is the Cleveland Clinic IBM Discovery Accelerator where multiple projects are underway that leverage the latest in quantum computing, artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud to help expedite discoveries in biomedical research. At the Cleveland Clinic, we also recently unveiled the first quantum computer dedicated to health care research.\nTo complement our own innovations, in the first quarter, we acquired 3 companies that extend our capabilities in hybrid cloud and AI. We also continue to engage in projects that have a positive impact on society. Many clients are leveraging our technology and expertise to advance their sustainability agendas. For example, in the area of manufacturing, Siemens and IBM are announcing a new software solution that integrates software from both companies to enable sustainable product development. Sustainability is a focus area for all businesses. And just last week, we released our annual report on IBM's efforts in this area, IBM Impact. I'd encourage you to read about our progress in areas ranging from energy savings and carbon emissions reduction to skills development and increasing diversity.\nI'll conclude by saying that we are confident in the changes we have made to our business over the last 3 years, aligning our strategy, priorities and portfolio to the needs of our clients. This work, together with our continued focus on productivity, are enabling us to deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth.\nI'll now hand it over to Jim who will offer more insight into our performance and expectations.\n\nJames J. Kavanaugh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, International Business Machines Corp.\n\nThanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the first quarter. We delivered $14.3 billion in revenue, $1.4 billion of operating pretax income, $1.36 of operating earnings per share and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up about 4.5% at constant currency. That includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested. Currency rates impacted our reported revenue growth by 4 points. That is over $100 million more than spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago.\nAs always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue growth this quarter was led by software and consulting. Software revenue was up nearly 6% and consulting up 8%. These are our growth vectors and now represent about 3/4 of our annual revenue. Our infrastructure revenue was flat, with continued strength in z Systems. All 3 of our geographies grew, with high single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Across our business, more than half of IBM's revenue is recurring, led by high-value software, which is growing at mid-single-digit rate.\nLooking at our profit metrics for the quarter. Operating gross margin expanded 80 basis points. We expanded gross margin in all segments with a strong portfolio mix overall. Operating pretax income, excluding the impact of workforce rebalancing, was up 12%, and margin expanded 130 basis points. You'll recall back in January, I mentioned we were planning to address remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions and we anticipated a charge of about $300 million. As we executed our plan, we took a charge of $260 million in the first quarter, and we expect to complete this action in the second quarter. This workforce rebalancing charge primarily addresses indirect support function. We are no longer including workforce rebalancing charges in our measure of segment profit to provide a view of our segment results consistent with our ongoing operational profile.\nAt the IBM level, including the workforce rebalancing activity, operating pretax income was down 4%, and margin was down 50 basis points. Within our margin performance, we absorbed a significant currency headwind. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pretax profit growth by about $160 million and operating PTI margin by 70 basis points year-to-year. As I've discussed in the past, this essentially impacts our product-based businesses. Mitigating that, the change in useful lives of our server and networking equipment provides a 50 basis point year-to-year benefit to operating PTI margin, which is included primarily in our infrastructure segment.\nTaking it back up a level, IBM's profit performance this quarter benefits from improvements in business mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. We've been digitally transforming IBM, much in the same way we're helping our clients with their transformation, using both IBM and third-party capabilities. Think of IBM as client zero. We are driving G&A efficiencies by reimagining and transforming the way we work. This includes optimizing our infrastructure and application environments as well as redesigning our end-to-end business processes.\nLet me give you a few examples. Across IBM's IT environment, we're realizing the value of hybrid cloud. We reduced the average cost of running an application by 90% by moving from a legacy data center environment to a hybrid cloud environment running on Red Hat OpenShift. We've been simplifying our application environment. By standardizing global processes and applying AIOps, we are reducing our application portfolio by more than 35%. We've automated over 24 million transactions with RPA, avoiding hundreds of thousands of manual tasks and eliminating the risk of human error, and we're deploying AI at scale to reengineer our business processes. We're doing that in areas like HR and talent, finance and end-to-end processes like quote-to-cash and source-to-pay. For example, in HR, we now handle 94% of our company-wide HR inquiries with our AskHR digital system, speeding up the completion of many HR tasks by up to 75%. These productivity initiatives free up spending for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated $1.3 billion in the quarter. This is up $100 million year-to-year and puts us on track to our full year expectation. Growth is driven by our profit performance and working capital efficiencies as well as lower payments for structural action. This was mitigated by an increase in capital expenditures and higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results. In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash over $17 billion, which is up nearly $9 billion from December. We have been opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt early in the year to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was over $58 billion, up nearly $8 billion from year-end.\nTurning to the segments. Software revenue grew nearly 6%, in line with software's mid-single-digit model. We had growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing. This performance captures the benefits of our growing recurring revenue stream, which is about 80% of annual software revenue with continued strong renewal rates. This, together with growth in software transactions this quarter, demonstrates clients' commitment to our hybrid cloud and AI platforms.\nIn hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 5%, fueled by growth across all business areas. We continue to see client demand for broad capabilities across Red Hat, automation, data in AI and security. Red Hat revenue grew 11%, with growth across all major offerings. We have particular strength in our hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift, and Ansible, our IT automation solution. Both offerings also continue to take market share this quarter. Automation revenue was up 2%, driven by integration and application servers, given client demand for improved IT performance and costs. In data and AI, revenue grew 3%, reflecting growth across data management, business analytics and asset and supply chain management. Many of these offerings, like Db2, serve as the underpinnings for modern AI and mission-critical workloads.\nSecurity revenue was up 2%, with growth across security for hybrid cloud, which includes both identity and threat management and security for data. Bringing this all together, our hybrid platform and solutions' ARR is now at $13.5 billion. In transaction processing, revenue grew 6.5%. The software remains core to our clients' hybrid cloud strategies. The strong performance of the last couple z Systems' cycles drove significant capacity growth. In fact, installed MIPS growth during our z15 cycle was 2x that of z14. This translates to software opportunity and contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Layering in this year's price increases, we delivered good performance in Transaction Processing this quarter.\nMoving to profit for the software segment. Gross margin was up and pretax margin was flat this quarter, with the latter absorbing nearly 1 point of impact from currency. Consulting revenue was up 8%, and I'll remind you, we had a strong growth in the first quarter of last year. Our book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months was 1.07. Signings in the quarter grew 7%, with similar performance across both larger and smaller engagements. We continue to see broad demand for projects that deliver technology-driven transformation, leveraging a hybrid cloud environment. Within the quarter, demand was solid for cloud modernization offerings, and we had one of our largest Red Hat signings quarters ever.\nMore recently, clients are particularly focused on driving productivity and cost reductions with greater agility and faster time to value. This is contributing to signings growth from digital transformations in areas such as talent, finance and supply chain transformation. In terms of revenue, while we had solid growth overall, we have seen some clients in the U.S. pull back on more discretionary projects, impacting backlog realization within the quarter.\nBringing it back up to the global level, business transformation grew 6%, technology consulting grew 4% and application operations grew 13%. Revenue growth was led by data and customer experience transformation project, in addition to cloud application development and management. Our hybrid cloud expertise and depth and breadth of strategic partnerships differentiate IBM Consulting in today's market. Red Hat consulting revenue, now over $2 billion annually, continue to grow at a double-digit rate. And our strategic partnerships continued strong growth, making up over 35% of our revenue in this segment over the last 12 months.\nMoving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pretax margins. Our pretax margin of about 8% in the quarter was up 50 basis points year-to-year as we continue to benefit from the productivity actions we've taken.\nTurning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was flat. Hybrid infrastructure revenue was up 4% and infrastructure support revenue was down 4%. Within hybrid infrastructure, z Systems revenue was up 11%. This was a fourth quarter of z16 availability, and the solid program performance has outpaced that of prior cycles. In addition to capabilities around embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security, clients are also leveraging z16 for its energy efficiency.\nFor example, consolidating Linux workloads on a single z16 system can reduce energy consumption by up to 75%. We continue to see strong growth in shipped MIPS for new Linux workloads on z16. Distributed infrastructure revenue was flat. Growth in storage was offset by declines in power as we have wrapped on the launch of the Power10 high-end systems. Moving to infrastructure profit. We expanded both gross and pretax margins. The 80 basis point improvement in pretax margin reflects benefits from both the z Systems' product cycle and changes in useful life, partially offset by nearly 2 points of currency impact.\nNow let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. When we first introduced today's IBM back in October of 2021, we provided a midterm model for revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth. We delivered on that model throughout last year and now have a good start to 2023. In the first quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, expanded gross margin, drove productivity in our underlying business and grew our free cash flow.\nLooking at full year 2023, as always, I'll start with our 2 primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. On the top line, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. And we continue to expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Inherent in our midterm model is margin expansion, driven by improving business mix, efficiency initiatives and productivity enhancement. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been a part of our operating and financial models.\nI mentioned some of the initiatives we have underway and we continue to evaluate additional actions. Altogether, the current initiatives are expected to deliver $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. These initiatives provide additional flexibility, enabling reinvestment in the business to support future growth, contributing to margin expansion and increasing financial flexibility.\nLet me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pretax profit performance by segment. In software, we continue to expect revenue growth in line with software's mid-single-digit model. This revenue growth drives operating leverage, and we still expect software pretax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations and application modernization. So as I said, we are seeing some pressure on more discretionary projects in the United States.\nWe now see Consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and continue to expect to expand Consulting pretax margin by at least 1 point as we capitalize on the yield of our productivity actions. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're about to wrap on the z16 introduction. As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue to decline, with pretax margin in the low teens.\nTo provide some perspective, Infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year. That's in line with our model. And we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the mid- to high teens range. As I mentioned earlier, the dollar has strengthened over the last 90 days. We now expect currency translation to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year, which is about 0.5 point worse than 90 days ago. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the unwinding of last year's hedging gain, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pretax margin expansion.\nLooking at the second quarter, we expect first to second quarter revenue seasonality to be fairly consistent with last year. That's up about $1.3 billion, though the underlying dynamics are different due primarily to z Systems' product cycle and currency. I'll remind you, we had a successful launch of our z16 in the second quarter of last year, and that creates a year-to-year headwind to growth of about 3 points.\nIn terms of profit, we now expect a little over 1/3 of our operating net income in the first half and just under 2/3 in the second half. This reflects a first half headwind from currency and workforce rebalancing dynamics, both of which flip to a tailwind in the second half. I mentioned the workforce rebalancing activity we have underway. Between the first and second quarter, the charge should be in the range of $300 million, maybe a little more. We still expect this action to pay back by the end of the year.\nIn closing, we entered the year as a more focused business with solid fundamentals. We had a good start to 2023 and are positioned to deliver revenue growth, expand margins and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A.\nPatricia, let's get started.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, International Business Machines Corp.\n\nThank you, Jim.

Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We delivered strong revenue growth in our business. The growth was broad based across our software, consulting and infrastructure segments as well as across geographies.\nOur clients recognize that technology continues to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Over the last several quarters, it has become clear that technology is playing a significant role in boosting productivity in the face of inflation, demographic shifts, supply chain challenges and sustainability requirements. We entered 2022, a more focused company and took steps to reinforce our position. We strengthened our consulting expertise and expanded strategic partnerships. To bolster our software portfolio, we invested in hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. We also delivered significant innovations in infrastructure with our Z16 and Power platforms. All of this was brought to market with a more technical and experiential sales approach.\nLooking back on the year, we are pleased with the progress we made. We delivered revenue growth above our mid-single-digit model, and we delivered solid free cash flow. But I'll acknowledge there is more to do. This year, we'll unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships and put more investment in specific growth markets.\nFor 2023, we see revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range and about $10.5 billion of free cash flow. This keeps us on a path of sustainable growth. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy.\nOur perspective is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the 2 most transformative technologies for business today. These technologies work together to drive business outcomes. Hybrid cloud is where the world is going. Containers are the preferred destination for applications. Hybrid cloud offers more value than relying on a singular public cloud. It enables organizations to drive business value across multiple clouds, on-premise or at the edge.\nThis includes scale, security, ease of use, flexibility of deployment, seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles. Our platform built on Red Hat is the leading container platform, allowing clients to harness the power of open source software innovations. IBM software and infrastructure technologies have been optimized for this platform. Our consultants and others leverage their extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate clients' digital transformation journeys.\nClients are realizing real value from working with IBM's hybrid cloud platform approach. For example, we worked with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, CIBC, to adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Using Red Hat technology, CIBC manages and scales its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility. They can now develop applications in a private cloud and quickly deploy them to a public cloud. They delivered hundreds of new applications and reduced provisioning time by 95% and deployment time by 50%.\nWe are helping Delta Air Lines leverage hybrid cloud to modernize options, automate operations and integrate security. IBM Consulting deployed Red Hat on Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud Paks to provide a consistent platform. Delta now has more levers they can use to boost developer productivity, reduce time to market and improve employee satisfaction. CIBC and Delta are both great examples of the value hybrid cloud can provide.\nLet's now talk about artificial intelligence or AI. AI is projected to contribute $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, including a massive boost in productivity by infusing AI into every enterprise process. We have been co-creating with many clients to deploy AI at scale. We automated the drive-through experience for quick-serve restaurants. We accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by automating the processes that assist millions of customers with inquiries and appointments. By applying AI and automation, we have helped security analysts reduce the time to respond to threats from hours or days to minutes.\nRecently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office partnered with IBM to leverage a host of AI capabilities that make it easier for people to glean insights from their vast database of patents. The BBC is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure.\nFor businesses, deploying AI can be challenging because it takes time to train each model. But by using large language models, companies can now create multiple models using the same data set. This means businesses can deploy AI with a fraction of the time and resources. That is why we are investing in large language or foundation models for our clients and have infused these capabilities across our AI portfolio.\nOur partner ecosystem plays a critical role in the execution of our strategy. In the fourth quarter, we made a series of new IBM software offerings available as a service in the AWS marketplace. Likewise, Red Hat continued the expansion of its offerings in hyperscaler marketplaces, making Ansible automation platform available on both Azure and AWS. Adobe and Salesforce are also leveraging open source innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings. Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP, Microsoft and AWS all over $1 billion in revenue for the year.\nWe've had great success with our strategic partners; and as we enter the new year, we are expanding and better enabling our broader ecosystem. Recently launched Partners Plus, a new simplified program that increases our reach and scale through new and existing IBM partners. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we introduced Red Hat Device Edge, a lightweight solution to flexibly deploy traditional or containerized workloads on small devices such as robots, IoT gateways, point of sale and public transport.\nWe also formed a collaboration with the Japanese consortium Rapidus to leverage the depth of our intellectual property on advanced semiconductors. We unveiled Osprey, a 433 qubit quantum processor that brings us closer to delivering our goal of building a 1,000 qubit system later this year.\nAt the same time, we continue to acquire companies to complement our organic innovation. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Octo, which improves our footprint in the U.S. federal market. This caps the year with 8 acquisitions across software and consulting.\nAs sustainability becomes more of a priority, companies need digital technologies to analyze data, creating a baseline and improve the way they operate. Our software has helped IBM reduce its own carbon footprint. Across IBM's global real estate presence, we were able to reduce carbon emissions by over 61% when compared to 2010. Using IBM Sustainability Software, we have simplified and automated our sustainability reporting processes and reduced reporting costs by 30%.\nLet me wrap by saying I'm pleased with the progress we have made with our portfolio, our go to market and our ecosystem. I'm confident in our ability to leverage hybrid cloud and AI to help clients turn business challenges into opportunities. Our strategy continues to strongly resonate with clients and partners, and this gives us a solid foundation to build upon in this year. While there is more to be done, we enter the new year as a more capable and nimble company, well equipped to meet our clients' needs.\nI will now turn it over to Jim, who will give you more detailed information on our performance and expectations.\n\nJames J. Kavanaugh\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, $3.8 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $3.60. In our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up over 6% at constant currency. While the dollar weakened a bit from 90 days ago, it still impacted our reported revenue by over $1 billion and 6.3 points of growth. As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency, and I'll remind you that we wrapped on the separation of Kyndryl at the beginning of November. The 1-month contribution to our fourth quarter revenue growth was offset by the impact of our divested health business.\nRevenue growth this quarter was again broad based. Software revenue was up 8% and consulting up 9%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 7%.\nWithin each of these segments, our growth was pervasive. We also had good growth across our geographies, with mid-single-digit growth or better in Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. And for the year, we gained share overall. We had strong transactional growth in software and hardware to close the year. At the same time, our recurring revenue, which provides a solid base of revenue and profit, also grew, led by software. I'll remind you that, on an annual basis, about half of our revenue is recurring.\nOver the last year, we've seen the results of a more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our approach to hybrid cloud is platform centric. As we land a platform, we get a multiplier effect across software, consulting and infrastructure. For the year, our hybrid cloud revenue was over $22 billion, up 17% from 2021.\nLooking at our profit metrics for the quarter, we expanded operating pretax margin by 170 basis points. This reflects a strong portfolio mix and improving software and consulting margins. These same dynamics drove a 60 basis point increase in operating gross margin. Our expense was down year-to-year driven by currency dynamics. Within our base expense, the work we're doing to digitally transform our operations provides flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and in talent. Our operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year. And our operating earnings per share of $3.60 was up over 7%.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated $5.2 billion in the quarter and $9.3 billion for the year. Our full year free cash flow is up $2.8 billion from 2021. As we talked about all year, we have a few drivers of our free cash flow growth. First, I'll remind you, 2021's cash flow results included Kyndryl-related activity including the impact of spin charges and CapEx. Second, we had working capital improvements driven by efficiencies in our collections and mainframe cycle dynamics. Despite strong collections, the combination of revenue performance above our model and the timing of the transactions in the quarter led to higher-than-expected working capital at the end of the year. This impacted our free cash flow performance versus expectations.\nOur year-to-year free cash flow growth also includes a modest tailwind from cash tax payments and lower payments for structural actions, partially offset by increased CapEx investment for today's IBM. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested $2.3 billion to acquire 8 companies across software and consulting, mitigated by over $1 billion in proceeds from divested businesses; and we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong liquidity position with cash of $8.8 billion. This is up over $1 billion year-to-year, and our debt balance is down nearly $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and I say the same for our retirement-related plans. At year-end, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are funded at 114%, with the U.S. at 125%. Both are up year-to-year.\nYou'll recall back in September, we took another step to reduce the risk profile of our plans. We transferred a portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan obligations to insurers without changing the benefits payable to plan participants. This resulted in a significant noncash charge in our GAAP results in the third quarter, and we'll see a benefit in our nonoperating charges going forward. You can see the benefit of this and other pension assumptions to the 2023 retirement-related costs in our supplemental charts.\nTurning to the segments. Software revenue grew 8%, fueled by growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing. We concluded the year with seasonally strong transactional performance as well as a solid and growing recurring revenue base in software.\nIn Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 10%, with pervasive growth across our business areas: Red Hat, automation, data and AI, and security. Our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI is resonating with clients. As a proof point, OpenShift, our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, now has $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And we modernize and optimize our software capabilities, including through Cloud Paks across automation, data and AI, and security for that platform.\nRed Hat revenue grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in OpenShift and Ansible, both growing double digits and gaining market share. Automation revenue was up 9%. Growth was led by business automation, application servers and integration as clients look to automate business workflows and improve applications. Data and AI revenue grew 8% with enterprise needs to organize, store and manage their data. This performance reflects demand in areas including data management, data fabric, and asset and supply chain management.\nSecurity delivered 10% revenue growth. We're helping clients detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, which led to strength across threat management, data security and identity. Across these businesses, the annual recurring revenue or ARR for Hybrid Platform & Solutions is $13.3 billion. And for all of software, hybrid cloud revenue is now more than $9.3 billion over the last year, up 16%.\nIn Transaction Processing, revenue was up 3%. Demand for this mission-critical software has followed increases in zSystems installed base capacity over the last couple of product cycles, and strong renewal rates continued this quarter. Both are evidence of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment.\nMoving to software profit. Our pretax margin was up 2 points this quarter, contributing to a full year margin of nearly 25%. Consulting revenue grew 9%. Clients are leveraging IBM's hybrid cloud leadership and deep industry expertise to navigate the complexity of their digital transformation journeys. Revenue growth was broad based across all business lines and geographies. And I'll remind you that this is on top of the 16% growth Consulting delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nStrong demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 17%. With this, fourth quarter had the best quarterly book to bill of the year, and we sequentially improved our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio to 1.1.\nClients are partnering with IBM Consulting as they decide what applications to modernize and how to migrate those applications across hybrid, multi-cloud environments. Over the last 12 months, Consulting delivered $9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 23%. This quarter, our Red Hat practice was again a meaningful contributor to this growth. Revenue from strategic partnerships also grew at a strong double-digit rate. We continue to see momentum in this space. In aggregate, our strategic partnership bookings were up over 50% with Azure and AWS more than doubling.\nTurning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 7%. Growth in business transformation was once again driven by data and client experience transformations along with supply chain and finance optimization. Our partnerships with key ISV partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe enable IBM Consulting to transform critical workloads at scale. In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 10%. Growth was led by cloud application development practices. Red Hat engagements along with our strategic hyperscaler partnerships contributed to the growth.\nApplication operations revenue grew 12%. We help clients to optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environment. Our incumbency and understanding of clients' applications are key differentiators.\nMoving to Consulting profit. Our pretax margin was 11% for the quarter and nearly 9% for the year. The fourth quarter margin is up nearly 2 points year-to-year and over 1 point sequentially. We are starting to see the benefit from pricing actions and productivity, and our acquisitions have become more accretive.\nTurning to Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 7% driven by hybrid infrastructure, which was up 11%. Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue grew 21% this quarter. Among the new z16 capabilities, clients are leveraging cyber resiliency to comply with business regulations and proactively avoid outages in their operation; and the new on-chip AI accelerator, for example, has been helping mitigate risk and detect fraud in credit card application processes.\nOur Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 5%. This performance was fueled by strength in Power following the extension of Power10 innovation throughout the product line. Infrastructure Support performance was flat including the impact from client adoption of new hardware with the latest z16 product cycle.\nMoving to Infrastructure profit. Pretax margin was down less than 1 point in the quarter. And for the full year, our pretax margin was nearly 15%.\nNow let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. At our investor briefing 15 months ago, we laid out our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and our priorities of revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Since then, we've been focused on our portfolio, our go-to-market model, our ecosystem and our capital allocation to execute that strategy and create value through focus.\nWe now just completed the first year as today's IBM. Our 2022 revenue was up nearly 12%, including nearly 4 points of incremental Kyndryl contribution. That's above our model of mid-single-digit growth. Over 70% of our revenue was in our growth vectors of software and consulting, and about half of our revenue is recurring.\nWith this high-value mix and contribution from the incremental Kyndryl revenue, we expanded our full year operating pretax margin by 2.5 points. And our free cash flow was $9.3 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year. We invested organically and inorganically and returned significant value to shareholders through dividends.\nNow there were some external factors that we faced this past year that impacted our profit and cash. We exited a profitable business in Russia. We are dealing with a much stronger dollar, and we are operating in a highly inflationary environment, which put pressure on our margins, especially in Consulting.\nPutting it all together, we are pleased with the fundamentals of our business and the progress we have made in executing our strategy. Our 2022 performance demonstrates that we now have a higher growth, higher value company with higher return on invested capital and a strong and growing free cash flow.\nFor 2023, we again expect solid growth in our 2 most important measures of success: revenue and free cash flow. Arvind talked about the important role technology plays in this environment and how our solutions are closely aligned to the needs of our clients. With this, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the year to be in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we enter this year, I think it's prudent to expect the low end of the mid-single-digit model. And for free cash flow, we'd expect to generate about $10.5 billion in 2023, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year.\nLet me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pretax profit performance by segment. In Software, with continued momentum in our recurring revenue stream in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, we expect revenue growth in line with software's mid-single-digit model. This revenue growth generates operating leverage, and we'd expect software pretax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. Consulting's model is to deliver high single-digit revenue.\nWe're coming off a strong year with revenue growth of 15% as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and strong book-to-bill ratio support Consulting revenue growth at the high end of its model despite the tough compare. We expect to expand Consulting pretax margin by at least 1 point as we continue to realize more of the price increases and improved utilization. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're entering the year 3 quarters into the z16 cycle, and we'll also [wrap up] Power10.\nAs a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue below its model and pretax margin in the low teens. For perspective, Infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point. That's in line with our model. And our tax rate should be in the mid- to high teens range.\nLet me comment on a few items within our expectations. First, as I said, currency was a significant headwind in 2022, impacting revenue by $3.5 billion. With the movement of spot rates over the last 90 days, currency translation would be fairly neutral to revenue in 2023 with a headwind in the first half flipping to a tailwind in the second. But I'll remind you that we had over $650 million of hedging gains in 2022, which will not repeat in 2023, resulting in an impact to our profit and cash on a year-to-year basis.\nSecond, as you know, we've taken a number of significant portfolio actions over the last couple of years, which has resulted in some stranded costs in our business. We expect to address these remaining stranded costs early in the year and anticipate a charge of about $300 million in the first quarter. We would start to see benefits in the second half and pay back by the end of the year.\nAnd then third, we regularly review the useful lives of our assets. Due to advances in technology, we are making an accounting change to extend the useful life of our server and networking equipment effective the first of January. Based on our year-end asset base, we expect this change to benefit 2023 pretax profit by over $200 million, primarily in our Infrastructure segment. Given this is a change to the depreciation, there's no benefit to cash.\nLooking at the first quarter. Our constant currency revenue growth should be fairly consistent with the full year. Reported growth will also include about a 3-point currency headwind at current spot rates. With operating leverage, we'd expect operating pretax margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points in the first quarter. And that's before the charge I just mentioned for the remaining stranded costs. Given the timing of currency and stranded cost dynamics, we'd expect about 1/3 of our net income in the first half and about 2/3 in the second half.\nTo sum it all up, we have made a lot of progress this past year. While there's always more work to do, we're confident in the fundamentals of our business, and how we're positioned as we enter the new year.\nPatricia, let's go to the Q&A.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of IR, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information for the quarter and the year is provided at the end of the presentation.

This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nTo provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website.\nFinally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you for joining us today. The results we delivered in the third quarter reflect our continued focus on the execution of our strategy with over $14 billion of revenue and strong growth across the portfolio. Technology remains a fundamental source of competitive advantage, and we continue to see solid demand for our hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Continued double-digit revenue growth in IBM Consulting, capturing client demand for digital transformations. Software revenue performance was also strong with growth across all categories. And our Infrastructure business had another high-growth quarter in both zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure. Our revenue strength was broad-based geographically as well.\nWhen I talk with clients, it's clear there's a real opportunity to help businesses leverage technology in today's environment. Clients are dealing with everything from inflation to demographic shifts, from supply chain bottlenecks to sustainability efforts. By deploying powerful hybrid cloud and AI technologies, IBM is helping businesses seize new opportunities, overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger.\nWe, too, are building a stronger company that is closely aligned to the needs of our clients. In line with our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we have continued to focus our portfolio, invest in our offerings, technical talent and ecosystem and streamline our go-to-market model. With strong performance through the first 3 quarters, we are taking up our revenue expectations for the year and now expect 2022 revenue above our mid-single-digit model.\nLet me now turn to the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy. Our point of view is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the 2 most transformational enterprise technologies of our time. Hybrid cloud is already becoming the dominant architecture for enterprise. According to a recent survey by the Harris Poll, 77% of businesses surveyed that they have adopted hybrid cloud for their organizations with data located across multiple clouds, on-premise or at the edge. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can drive value across these different environments.\nOur platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume software driven by open source innovation. IBM's software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and security capabilities. Our consultants offer deep business expertise and co-create with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. And our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of a hybrid cloud environment.\nOur platform-centric strategy continues to have good momentum, adding a couple of hundred hybrid cloud platform clients in the third quarter. We see more and more clients consuming across our portfolio of Software, Consulting and Infrastructure capabilities. This quarter, clients such as Bank of America, Bharti Airtel and Samsung Electronics have chosen IBM to realize the full potential of a hybrid cloud computing model.\nLet me now say a few words about our AI capabilities. As demographic shifts continue to add pressure to modern economies, coupled with wage inflation, companies are eager to deploy AI and automation capabilities at scale to boost their levels of productivity. That is what IBM is helping companies bring to bear. In the context of enterprise, we are seeing 4 main use cases emerge: AI to interact and converse; AI to automate IT processes; AI to extract knowledge and insights; and finally, AI to automate business workflows such as HR, supply chains and financial reporting. We are working to bring these capabilities to clients across all industries.\nFor instance, this quarter, IBM Consulting partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to automate business workflows related to the delivery of pension benefits. This helps free up valuable time of VA staff and speed up the processing of claims made by the veterans most in need. Our partner ecosystem is a crucial element of our strategy. Each quarter, we continue to expand the work we do with partners to serve our joint clients. For instance, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with VMware to help clients in regulated industries more easily move workloads to the cloud, with IBM Consulting now serving as a GSI partner for VMware.\nWe announced that Red Hat and Dell are launching a set of containerized solutions aimed at simplifying the management of multi-cloud environments on-premise. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 90% of organizations will use containers. These actions represent another step in our efforts to seize this opportunity through ecosystem relationships and our technology offerings.\nWe are actively working to introduce new innovations and shape the technologies of the future. Most recently, we unveiled the next generation of our LinuxONE server, a Linux and Kubernetes-based platform designed to support thousands of workloads within the footprint of a single system. As an example, Citibank is hosting MongoDB on IBM LinuxONE, leveraging the platform's security, resiliency and elastic capacity and helping Citi lower its overall carbon footprint.\nWe also continue to make progress in quantum computing. We remain on track towards our goal of building a 1,000-qubit system by 2023. To advance the security of our communication networks, IBM alongside Vodafone recently joined the GSMA Post-Quantum Telco Network Taskforce. This task force aims to introduce a framework for the telco industry to adopt new quantum-safe approaches.\nComplementing our organic innovation, we recently acquired Dialexa. This brings our total number of acquisitions this year to 7, adding new capabilities in areas like hybrid cloud services, security, data observability and sustainability. As the world takes on the challenge of sustainability and building a more circular economy, IBM has been building a portfolio of solutions to help companies make progress on this journey.\nThis quarter, we received recognition, highlighting our sustainability efforts. The analyst firm HFS Research and Forbes both recognized IBM for its capabilities in the area of sustainability, including Envizi and our Environmental Intelligence Suite software.\nLet me conclude by reminding you that last October and just prior to the separation of Kyndryl, we held our investor briefing, laying out priorities for our portfolio and growth. Over the last 4 quarters, we have driven constant currency revenue growth at or above our mid-single-digit model with solid free cash flow. And while there is always more to do, we are pleased with our first year's progress. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategy and execution and feel we are well positioned to address today's client needs.\nLet me now turn it over to Jim, who will provide more details on the quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year.\n\nJames J. Kavanaugh\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights. In the third quarter, we delivered $14.1 billion in revenue, $2 billion of operating pretax income and a margin of nearly 14%, and operating earnings per share of $1.81. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated over $4 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue was up 15%, which includes about 5 points of contribution from sales to Kyndryl. While we'll discuss our results today at constant currency, I'll mention that with the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, currency translation impacted our reported revenue growth by more than 8 points or nearly $1.1 billion.\nAs Arvind said, our revenue growth this quarter was pervasive. Software revenue was up 14% and Consulting up 16%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 23%, reflecting solid product cycle dynamics. Software and Infrastructure include about 8 and 9 points of growth, respectively, from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl. More than half of our revenue is recurring, and this annuity content, which is driven by software, continues to grow.\nPerformance was also broad-based by geography. Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific revenue were all up double digits, and we gained share overall. These revenue results reflect the execution of more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy based on a platform-centric approach and leveraging a broad ecosystem of partners. Our full stack capabilities across Software, Consulting and Infrastructure delivered 20% growth in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year to over $22 billion.\nLooking at our profit metrics, operating pretax income was up and margin expanded by 180 basis points year-to-year. These profit dynamics reflect our portfolio shift toward higher value led by software. This mix shift is contributing to profit and margin. Our pretax profit also includes the contribution from incremental sales to Kyndryl. Like our clients, we are focused on digitally transforming our own operations, applying AI and automation to drive productivity and efficiency in the spend base. This provides flexibility to continue to invest in talent, innovation and our ecosystem in an inflationary environment.\n90 days ago, we spent some time talking about currency dynamics. I'll remind you of a few of the key points. A stronger dollar impacts our revenue and gross profit dollars. We execute a hedging program, which defers versus eliminates the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense. But with the rate and magnitude of the movements and because we don't hedge all currencies, we do have a currency impact to our overall profit and cash flow.\nWrapping up the discussion on profit dynamics. The currency impacts and a good amount of investments are in gross profit. While the mitigating hedging benefits and operational productivity are reflected primarily in expense. As a result, pretax income is a better indicator of our profit performance. Our operating tax rate was about 16%. Compared to last year, tax is a significant year-to-year headwind to operating net income and operating EPS growth, which were both down modestly year-to-year.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated $4.1 billion in the first 3 quarters. That's up over $900 million year-to-year. We're wrapping on payments related to the Kyndryl separation and the 2020 structural action and driving working capital efficiencies. In terms of uses of cash in the first 3 quarters, we invested over $1 billion in acquisitions, which was more than offset by proceeds from divested businesses. And we returned nearly $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we issued debt in July to prudently get ahead of our 2023 maturities. Our debt balance is up since June but down nearly $1 billion since December. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with cash of $9.7 billion. This is up over $2 billion from year-end and well in excess of the minimum cash required for our business.\nTurning to the segments. Software revenue grew 14%. This includes about 8 points of Kyndryl contribution, both of our revenue categories, Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing through this quarter. This performance reflects our strong and growing recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual Software revenue. And Software's hybrid cloud revenue is now $9.2 billion over the last year, up 20%. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 8%, including about 1.5 points contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship.\nThe growth was broad-based. Red Hat revenue all-in grew 18%. As a leader in open source technologies for the enterprise, Red Hat's performance was again fueled by market share gains across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible this quarter. With our enterprise incumbency and global scale, we continue to see an increase in large deals as well as strong cross-sell and upsell across Red Hat solutions.\nAutomation revenue grew 3%. This quarter's performance reflects continued adoption in areas like AIOps and management and integration, while we're also wrapping a strong acquisition content from last year. We're bringing innovation to our clients this quarter such as new Instana observability capabilities for zSystems in a hybrid cloud environment. In data and AI, revenue was up 4%. Let me highlight just a few of the growth areas this quarter. Data management fuels advanced analytics. Data fabric helps clients discover and unlock the value of their data wherever it resides, and information exchange enables the timely and secure flow of complex B2B information. And offerings like Envizi and Environmental Intelligence Suite are resonating with clients as they prioritize sustainability efforts.\nSecurity revenue was up 6%, with growth in both data security and threat management. In data security, we're seeing adoption of Guardium Insights as we continue to deliver new product innovation. Threat management growth was led by Cloud Pak for Security, which helps clients prevent and respond to modern threats across disparate security feeds. Across Hybrid Platform & Solutions, the annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is now $13 billion and up 9%. Transaction Processing revenue was up 33%, including about 26 points of Kyndryl contribution. The increase in zSystems' installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and continued strong renewal rates are recognition of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, the transaction processing annuity base is now growing.\nLooking at Software profit, we delivered operating leverage, given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up more than 4 points over last year. Consulting revenue grew 16%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This strong performance was again broad-based with revenue growing at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Over the last year, our book-to-bill ratio is 1.05. Clients trust IBM's deep industry expertise and co-creation approach throughout their hybrid cloud and digital transformation journeys.\nAs IBM Consulting designs and enables enterprise hybrid cloud strategies, this business delivered $8.9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year. That's up 28%. Our Red Hat consulting practice continues to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth, growing strong double digits as we add new engagements. Since IBM acquired Red Hat just over 3 years ago, Consulting has led nearly 1,400 Red Hat engagements with over $6.5 billion in aggregate bookings. Strategic partnerships also contributed to performance, continuing to grow revenue at a double-digit rate.\nTurning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 14% as clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive, driven by supply chain, finance, data and client experience transformations. Working with our partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe, we help our clients optimize their operations and improve the way they engage with their customers.\nIn technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 17%. Once again, growth was led by cloud application development and cloud modernization, including our Red Hat practice, which as I mentioned, grew strong double digits. Application operations revenue grew 17%. IBM helps clients optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of clients' applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. We leverage AI to help predict problems before they happen and monitor our clients' different environments with dashboards, enabling action to be taken quickly.\nMoving to Consulting profit. Our pretax margin of about 10% is down year-to-year though up nearly 3 points from the second quarter. As we've discussed in prior quarters, Consulting is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. Those dynamics continue to put pressure on the margin profile. However, coming out of the third quarter, we are seeing signs of progress. Our utilization rates are improving as we exited the quarter, our acquisitions are scaling and are on a path to margin accretion, and we've seen 2 quarters of price margin improvement year-over-year that will benefit our margin profile going forward.\nMoving to our Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 23%. This includes about 9 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 41% and infrastructure support revenue grew 5%, including about 11 and 7 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. Looking at hybrid infrastructure, z System's revenue nearly doubled, driven by continued adoption of our newest program, z16. This latest program combines embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security. In fact, z16 is the industry's first quantum-safe system, delivering 25 billion encrypted transactions per day for clients.\nAnd as Arvind mentioned, we just introduced our newest LinuxONE server, a highly scalable Linux and Kubernetes-based platform with capabilities to reduce clients' energy consumption. zSystems remains an enduring platform, playing an important role in a hybrid cloud environment. Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 21%. Recent innovation across the portfolio enabled broad-based growth within both storage and power. These include the expansion of our Power10 server family earlier this quarter and refreshes to the flash storage solutions throughout this year. Looking at Infrastructure profit, pretax margin was up 1 point year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems.\nNow let me take it back up to the IBM level, and I'll shift the focus to the full year and the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we've continued to invest and make portfolio changes to advance our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, streamline our go-to-market and digitally transform our own operations. Our more focused strategy and portfolio is aligned to client needs. Our revenue performance so far this year demonstrates that. And based on this revenue performance in the first 3 quarters, as Arvind said, we now see constant currency revenue growth above our mid-single-digit model for the year.\nOn top of that, Kyndryl sales add about 3.5 points of growth, primarily in the first 3 quarters of the year so it's essentially behind us. U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. And at mid-October spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 7-point headwind to growth for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this impacts profit and free cash flow as well.\nLooking at free cash flow, our other key metric, we continue to expect to generate about $10 billion for the year. That's up over $3 billion from last year. A large part of that growth comes from the wrap on the Kyndryl spin-related and structural payments. But we're also driving working capital efficiency and improving operating profit profile. We expect strong free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter while we continue to face some external headwinds, including appreciation of the U.S. dollar and exit of our Russia operations.\nIn terms of segment performance for 2022, our view of Software has been consistent all year. We continue to expect revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. And we still see Software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. Our IBM Consulting revenue growth has been great, and we're taking our view up to a mid-teens revenue growth rate for the year. While we're still operating in a competitive labor environment, we see some encouraging signs in our Consulting margin profile exiting the third quarter. We now expect a Consulting pretax margin for the year at the low end of our previous 9% to 10% range, which is up about 1 point year-to-year.\nOur Infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. With the strong launch of our z16 earlier this year, Infrastructure revenue performance will be above the model level for the year, and that's before the 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We expect Infrastructure pretax margin in the mid-teens.\nLooking specifically at the fourth quarter, we expect all-in constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit range. At current spot rates, currency translation has increased to an 8- to 9-point headwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That's up 2 to 3 points from 90 days ago. And then I'll remind you, in a couple of weeks, we'll reach the anniversary of our separation of Kyndryl. While the external sales to Kyndryl will remain in our revenue and profit base, we've essentially wrapped around the year-to-year contribution to our revenue and profit growth and margin expansion.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, we look forward to closing out our first calendar year of today's IBM. As always, we'll provide a view of 2023 during our fourth quarter earnings report in January. Patricia, now let's go on to the Q&A.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of IR, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items: first, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation; and second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions.

These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we drove solid results reflecting the investments and changes we have been making to execute our strategy. With this performance, we continue to deliver on our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth.\nTechnology plays an important role in today's business environment. In fact, nearly every client I speak to believes that technology serves as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It serves as both a deflationary force and a force multiplier and is especially critical as clients face challenges on multiple fronts from supply chain bottlenecks to demographic shifts.\nGiven its ability to boost innovation, productivity, resilience and help organizations scale, IT has become a high priority in our company's budget. As such, there is every reason to believe technology spending in the B2B space will continue to surpass GDP growth.\nWith this demand backdrop, we are executing our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We have made changes to our portfolio and focused investments in our offerings, technical talent, our ecosystem and go-to-market model.\nDemand for our solutions remains strong. We continue to have double-digit performance in IBM Consulting, broad-based trend in software. And with the z16 platform launch, our infrastructure business had a good quarter. By integrating technology and expertise from IBM and our partners, our clients will continue to see our hybrid cloud and AI solutions as a crucial source of business opportunity and growth.\nLet me now delve a little bit deeper into the progress and the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private clouds and on-premise properties, all the way to the edge. Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume powerful software capabilities driven by open source innovation. Our software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and the security capabilities our clients need. Our global team of consultants offers deep business expertise and cocreates with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment.\nAs a testament to the success of our strategy, we continue to increase adoption of our platform with over 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including more than 250 added in this past quarter alone. Apart from working with a greater number of clients, those who adopt our platform tend to consume more of our solutions across software, consulting and infrastructure, expanding our footprint within those clients. Recently, clients such as [P&C], Barclays and Citi have chosen our hybrid cloud capabilities to unlock more business value and meet rapidly changing client demands.\nOrganizations everywhere are also under intense pressure to fast track their digital transformation and harness the power of the data. With the world now creating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day, artificial intelligence, or AI, is the only way to process this enormous amount of data from hybrid cloud environments all the way to the edge. That is why AI adoption is steadily on the rise.\nAccording to a new study released by IBM last quarter, 35% of companies are now using some form of AI in their business. Many of those companies are using AI and automation to address demographic shifts and move their employees to higher value work. This is one of the many reasons we are investing heavily in both AI and automation. These investments are paying off.\nIn addition to the strong revenue performance in automation and data and AI software, we recently received 2 important recognitions. We were named as a leader in the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for APM and Observability and in The Forrester Data Fabric Wave for our Cloud Pak for data.\nOver the last several quarters, I've highlighted the importance of the growing ecosystem of partners to our platform-centric strategy with leading firms like SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, Oracle, Microsoft and AWS. This quarter, we continue to expand and extend our partnerships. I'll expand on just 2.\nWe announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to offer a broad array of our software catalog on AWS. This includes capabilities that span Automation, Data & AI, Security and Sustainability. Second, with Tech Mahindra, we launched synergy lounges to empower businesses with the innovation technologies and services for key industries such as telecommunications, manufacturing, banking, health care, energy and utilities. The first synergy lounge was established in Bengaluru with a focus on edge, 5G and software-defined networking solutions with hybrid cloud. This will be followed by the opening of 3 more centers in London, Seattle and Melbourne.\nClients aren't just simply buying software or hardware. They're entering a relationship with the company that's going to help them navigate the future of technology. This is why innovation and our ability to invent what's next remains so important.\nQuantum is a great example of our commitment to advance the future of technology. Building on our progress of 127 qubit Quantum computer currently in our cloud, we have committed to demonstrate the first 400-plus qubit system before year-end. This will help us move forward towards our road map to deliver 1,000-plus qubit system next year and a 4,000-plus qubit system in 2025.\nOne of the implications of quantum computing will be the need to change how information is encrypted. We are proud that technology developed by IBM and our collaborators has been selected by NIST as the basis of the next generation of quantum-safe encryption protocols.\nIn another example of innovation, our new z16 system became generally available in the second quarter. The z16 is designed for cloud native development; server security resilience; quantum-safe encryption; and includes an on-chip accelerator, which allows clients to reduce fraud within real-time transactions.\nGiven the importance of cybersecurity, in this past quarter, we also acquired Randori, a leading attack surface management and offensive cybersecurity provider. This builds on the recent acquisition of ReaQta and the launch of QRadar XDR. It's one of 2 acquisitions in the second quarter and over 25% in the last 2 years.\nAnother major focus area across all stakeholders is ESG, which isn't just a regulatory requirement or about being a good corporate citizen. It's also a business opportunity. A poll conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that 50% of CEOs see sustainability as one of their highest priorities, and over 80% of CEOs believe their company's sustainability investments will improve business results and accelerate growth. To accomplish this, companies need to leverage AI and to turn the mountains of data they collect into sustainable action.\nSL Green Realty Corporation, Manhattan's largest office landlord, is a recent example. They are using Envizi, an IBM solution to manage their easy indicators across their extensive real estate operations, including energy use, carbon emissions and environmental and social responsibility metrics.\nLet me wrap up by saying that given the strength of our portfolio, the need for our technology and expertise with the benefits we're yielding from any actions, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenue in 2022 at the high end of our mid-single-digit model.\nNow let me hand it over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our second quarter performance and add color on our expectations for the balance of the year.\n\nJames J. Kavanaugh\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.5 billion of operating pretax income, which is a margin of 16.2%; and operating earnings per share of $2.31. In the first half of the year, we generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue was up 16%. This includes nearly 5 points of incremental revenue from Kyndryl.\nAs always, we discussed revenue growth at constant currency. But given the focus on the sharply strengthening dollar, I'll mention that currency translation impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points of growth or $900 million. That's over $200 million more than the spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago.\nToday's IBM has a higher growth profile driven by our growth vectors of software and consulting. More than half of our annual revenue is recurring, with about 2/3 of that in high-value software. Software revenue this past quarter was up 12%; and Consulting, up 18%. Infrastructure performance, which reflects a good start to our z16 product cycle, was up 25%. Software and infrastructure each include about 7 points of growth from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl.\nThese results reflect the investments we've been making in innovation, our ecosystem and talent, all aligned to our strategic areas of hybrid cloud and AI. We integrate consulting and technology to deliver these hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Our platform approach not only benefits our clients but also provides an attractive economic model for IBM and our partners with a multiple of software and consulting revenue generated for every dollar of platform revenue. Our hybrid cloud revenue from our full stack capabilities across software, consulting and infrastructure was up 19% over the last year. It has grown to $21.7 billion or 36% of our total revenue.\nLooking at our P&L metrics. Operating gross profit dollars were up driven by strong revenue performance in our high-value businesses. Our year-to-year gross margin decline reflects escalating labor and component costs. We're addressing this through pricing, though it takes some time to show up in our margin profile, especially in consulting. Our operating pretax income was up, and we expanded margin by 420 basis points. We had an operating tax rate of about 16.5%, which is up about 2 points versus last year, and our operating net income margin expanded 330 basis points.\nLet me comment on a few dynamics within our profit performance. Our pretax profit reflects the benefit from actions we've taken to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model as well as profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship post separation.\nOur profit this quarter also reflects recent portfolio actions. At the end of June, we closed on the divestiture of our health care software assets, generating a pretax gain of about $230 million in the period. Mitigating that benefit to our overall profit results, we took charges to address stranded costs associated with the divestiture and absorbed operating losses related to the health business, together, over $75 million.\nWe also announced the orderly wind down of our Russian operations, resulting in incremental charges in the quarter. Together with the year-to-year loss business due to the wind down, Russia impacted our profit results by another roughly $100 million.\nI also want to comment on the impact of currency. I mentioned that over the last 90 days, we've dealt with a sharply strengthening dollar. We execute hedge programs that cover the majority but not all of the currency exposure. The combination of the rate and velocity of movement this quarter and the fact that we don't hedge 100% results in a currency impact to our profit and cash flow.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated over $2 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion for the first half with good working capital performance. This first half free cash flow is about 33% of our full year expected range, consistent with the average of the last few years. I'll remind you the $1 billion plus of proceeds from the health divestiture is reflected in cash from investing activities versus in our free cash flow.\nIn terms of uses of cash for the first half, we invested nearly $1 billion in acquisitions with 5 closed this year, and we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a June cash position of nearly $8 billion, which is up slightly from year-end. And our debt of just over $50 billion is down about $1.5 billion over the same period.\nTurning to the segments. Software revenue grew 12%. This includes about 7 points from the Kyndryl software content. Growth was driven by our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. Hybrid cloud revenue for the segment now represents $9 billion over the last year, up 23%.\nSoftware subscription and support renewal rates were up again this quarter. This contributes to our solid and growing recurring revenue base, which represents about 80% of software. From a revenue category perspective, our software growth vector of Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 9%. This includes about 1.5 points benefit from the Kyndryl commercial relationship.\nWe again drove pervasive growth across Red Hat, Automation, Data & AI and Security. Red Hat revenue all in grew 17%. Revenue growth was fueled by new adoption and expansion of RHEL and OpenShift as both solutions continue to take share. These key offerings address hybrid cloud requirements in industries like financial services, public sector and telecommunications, across environments and out to the edge.\nAutomation revenue was up 8%. Solid performance in both AI ops and management and integration demonstrates the importance of automation in the IT journeys of our clients. We had strength in offerings like Turbonomic and Instana for observability; Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps; and our modern integration platform, Cloud Pak for Integration.\nData & AI revenue grew 4%. This growth was led by demand for data fabric, data management and asset and supply chain management solutions. We also just expanded our Data Fabric portfolio with the acquisition of Databand.ai, which helps organizations with data observability.\nSecurity revenue was up 5% with growth in threat management and identity as enterprises continue to adopt a Zero Trust security strategy and implement additional identity controls. We're continuing to invest in our security capabilities, having completed 2 acquisitions in the threat management space over the last few quarters.\nAcross the 4 Hybrid Platform & Solution business areas, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is nearly $12.9 billion, up 8%.\nTurning to our software value vector, transaction processing, revenue grew 19%, including 22 points from the Kyndryl content. We continue to have strong renewal rates for this mission-critical software and performed in line with our expectations this quarter.\nLooking at software profit. We delivered operating leverage given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up 4 points and keeps us on track for a full year software margin in the mid-20s.\nMoving on to Consulting. We again saw pervasive growth with double-digit revenue growth across all business lines and geographies. Revenue was up 18% compared to 8% growth a year ago. We maintained a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 on a trailing 12-month basis as clients are choosing to co-create with IBM, trusting our deep industry expertise.\nThe expansion of our skills, capabilities and ecosystems are enabling us to capture demand as we drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and help clients with their digital transformations. Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% over the last year to $8.6 billion. Momentum behind our Red Hat practice remains strong. We nearly doubled our Red Hat consulting revenue in the quarter and continued solid Red Hat bookings, which now exceeds $6 billion inception to date.\nOur strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships continue to grow solid double digits, led by Azure, AWS and SAP and Salesforce.\nTurning to our lines of business. Business transformation grew 16%. Its clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive and led by our offerings focused on customer experience transformation, data transformation and our SAP practices.\nIn technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 23%. Cloud modernization and cloud application development led a significant portion of the growth, with on-prem modernization also contributing to the strong revenue performance in the quarter.\nApplication operations revenue grew 17%. Growth was solid across our cloud offerings, mitigated by declines in the on-prem space. In this business, we are optimizing the management of applications and providing cloud platform services required to run our clients' hybrid cloud environments.\nMoving to consulting profit. Our pretax margin expanded 1 point as we deliver operating leverage and benefit from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting margins reflect the significant investments we have been making to capture demand and fuel our revenue growth. We continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, scale acquisitions and add skills.\nConsulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the inflationary labor market and increasing labor cost as we bring and increase capacity. We are starting to capture the reality of these higher costs in our pricing. But given the time from contract signing to revenue realization, it's taking some time to see it in our margins.\nTurning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 25%, including about 7 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue grew 41%. And infrastructure support revenue grew 5%, including about 7 and 8 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively.\nWithin hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 77%. This reflects solid execution around our z16 program, building on the momentum from z15. As Arvind mentioned, z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. We are seeing growth in new workloads like Linux and demand for AI capabilities like real-time fraud detection, leveraging the on-chip AI accelerator. Clients are investing in zSystems platform as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure.\nDistributed infrastructure revenue grew 17% this quarter. This growth was led by storage, driven by both high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and distributed storage. We also had good performance in high-end Power10. Just last week, we announced the expansion of our Power10 server family as we deliver flexible and secure infrastructure for hybrid cloud environments.\nLooking at infrastructure profit, pretax margin was up 4 points year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems, mitigated by the impact of increased component cost and supplier premiums.\nNow let me take it back up to the IBM level. We've taken actions and made investments over the last couple of years to execute a platform-centric hybrid cloud and AI strategy. IBM is now a more focused, faster-growing and higher value company. And while there is always more work to do, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth.\nOur first half results were solid. We continue to see constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model for the full year. And on top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth from the Kyndryl sales spread over the first 3 quarters.\nI mentioned the impact of currency to our 2Q results. With the significant movement of the U.S. dollar as compared to nearly every currency, at mid-July spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 6-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. That's a degradation of about $1.5 billion from April's rates with most of that incremental impact still ahead of us in the second half.\nCurrency is one unique issue we're dealing with. The other is the impact of exiting our Russia operation. Together, these are putting some pressure on our near-term results, and we now expect free cash flow of about $10 billion for the year. These are exogenous issues. Importantly, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals of our business. You see this in our segment expectations. Halfway through the year, there's no change to our full year view of software. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022.\nOur IBM consulting revenue growth has been strong, and we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth rate for the year, which is above our model. With continued investment in skills and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a consulting pretax margin of 9% to 10%, which is up over 1 point year-to-year. This reflects improving margin performance in the second half as we increase utilization of the resources we've added and price realization starts to flow to revenue.\nOur infrastructure revenue in any period reflects product cycle dynamics. We had a very strong launch of our z16 platform in the second quarter. This will drive infrastructure revenue performance above the model level for the year. On top of that, we're planning for about 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from the sales to Kyndryl in 2022. Despite some of the pressures from component cost increases and supplier premiums, we continue to see mid- to high-teens pretax margin for infrastructure for the full year.\nThese segment revenue and margin dynamics yield about a 3.5 point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. And we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. You'll recall that back in January, we expected a 40-60 first half/second half profit SKU. Now after a solid start to the year, our view hasn't changed, and we still see 60% of the full year profit in the second half.\nLooking at the third quarter, we expect all in constant currency revenue growth in the high single-digit range and about a 2-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin. I want to mention 2 specific items on the third quarter. First, at current spot rates, currency translation has increased to about an 8-point headwind to revenue growth, impacting our reported revenue, profit and cash. Second, we haven't had a zSystems product introduction in our large transactional second quarter in about 20 years. This unique timing, coupled with the strong start to the cycle, will result in a larger second to third quarter impact than typical seasonality. So to be clear, we expect a strong year-to-year growth in zSystems.\nIn closing, these are interesting times, and we see technology as a way to help our enterprise clients capture today's opportunities and navigate challenges. We feel good about the strategy we are executing and the fundamentals of our business.\nPatricia, now let's go on to the Q&A.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of IR, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nNow I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of IR, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nTo provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC.\nFinally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results reflects the changes we have made to position our business for the future. This solid start to the year reinforces our confidence in our strategy, and we now see revenue growth for 2022 at the high end of our mid-single-digit model.\nWhat we are hearing from clients is clear. Technology has become a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It is at the very center of how businesses scale and is no longer perceived primarily as a way to cut costs. This is especially true in our current environment. Harnessing the power of technologies such as hybrid cloud and AI remains essential as our clients face a number of strategic challenges and opportunities, whether it's competing for talent, supply chain issues, inflation, cybersecurity or geopolitical instability.\nWe continue to see a strong demand environment for both technology and consulting as we help our clients respond to these issues. Over the last 2 years, we have been optimizing our portfolio, expanding our ecosystem and simplifying our go-to-market to capture this demand. This quarter, we again had double-digit revenue growth in consulting, and Software growth reflects solid performance across the portfolio. Our Infrastructure business, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. Our revenue performance this quarter is a strong indication that our focus, our investments and our actions are paying off.\nBefore we go further, let me say a few words about the war in Ukraine. We are, first and foremost, focused on the safety and security of our employees. IBM is providing help, including relocation assistance and financial support to IBMers in the region and matching donations from our employees around the world to nonprofits. In terms of the business impact from Russia, Jim will quantify but I'll say the impact is measurable but not large.\nLet me now turn to the progress we are making when it comes to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid Cloud is all about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private cloud and on-premise properties that our clients typically have. The platform we have built is open, secure and flexible. At its core, it is based on Red Hat, which gives clients powerful software capabilities based on open source innovation. Our software has been optimized for that platform and helps our clients apply AI, automation and security to make their business work better. Our global team of consultants offer deep business expertise. They do this by co-creating with clients and finding ways to harness the power of technology to accelerate their digital transformation journeys.\nOur infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. This platform-centric strategy is producing solid results. We have more than 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including 200 added in the first quarter. This gives us 2 avenues of growth from the incremental number of clients, but more importantly, it allows us to expand our software, consulting and infrastructure footprint at these clients.\nClients such as Charles Schwab, Discover Financial and the U.S. Department of Education have all recently chosen IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities to digitally transform and build new and differentiated experiences and services.\nClients also turned to IBM's AI capabilities to move their employees to higher-value tasks and improve their customer experiences. For instance, IBM is now working with McDonald's to pilot an automated drive-thru experience with Watson Orders. In addition, TD Securities is using IBM's AI-powered virtual assistant in support of their precious metals digital stores. We were recently recognized in this area as a leader in a Gartner Magic Quadrant. These highlight our ability to drive innovation in natural language processing and bring these new capabilities to clients.\nAn important element of our platform strategy is our partner ecosystem, where we continue to gain momentum. We see this in IBM Consulting, where signings with our ecosystem partners were up more than 50% to $2 billion this quarter. In the first quarter, we continue to broaden our ecosystem. We announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with SAP, serving as SAP's RISE premium partner to help clients move workloads to the cloud.\nWith Adobe, we announced a significant expansion of a partnership around the use of AI-powered weather data on the Adobe Experience Platform.\nWe are collaborating with Worley and ABB to build a digitally enabled solution that will help energy companies build and operate green hydrogen facilities more efficiently and at scale.\nWe also signed an agreement to join the UAE's network of Industry 4.0 champion, a major public-private partnership designed to accelerate the digital transformation of the country's industrial sector.\nWithin IBM, we are making significant changes to the way we work to build a client-centric culture based on technical excellence. Our new client engagement model based on experiential selling, client engineering and co-creation is strongly resonating among clients. Over the last few quarters, sales productivity is rising, renewal rates are increasing and recurring revenue is growing.\nWhile we are focused on meeting the needs of clients today, we continue to shape the technologies of tomorrow. Most recently, we announced the IBM z16 platform in early April. z16 is designed for cloud native development, cybersecurity resilience and includes an on-chip AI accelerator. This allows clients to reduce fraud within realtime transactions. The z16 exemplifies our ability to drive critical innovations to a platform that remains essential to the world's economy.\nAt the same time, we are bullish on the immense potential that automation represents. We firmly believe that our AIOps capabilities are poised to seize the significant opportunity. In the last quarter, we announced a new AIOps solution in collaboration with Flexera that is designed to automate software license compliance.\nQuantum is another example of our commitment to advance the fundamental signs of computing. by deploying the world's first 127-qubit processor, we are the only company to have an actual operational computer that is available on our cloud. Companies and governments around the world are taking steps to prepare for Quantum. As an example, we have recently forged new partnerships with HSBC and the Government of Quebec.\nDelivering organic innovation remains an important and constant focus. At the same time, we continue to make acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and add value to our clients. In line with this thinking, we completed 3 acquisitions in the first quarter, Envizi, Neudesic and Sentaca.\nClients partners, employees and investors are placing a premium on ESG. As the world moves towards a more circular and sustainable economy, clients need help on their journey. That is why we recently launched the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a social impact program that applies IBM technology and consulting to help populations that are vulnerable to environmental threats. This is just one of the many efforts we have made around ESG, which you can see in IBM Impact, our first integrated ESG report that we released last week.\nI will wrap up by saying the results you are seeing this quarter are a direct reflection of our ability to execute against our strategy. Each quarter, we continue to strengthen our portfolio, expand our partner ecosystem and drive productivity and simplification through the business. IBM is now a very different company. We have, in effect, changed our company's trajectory. And while much remains to be done, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our hard-earned efforts, and we are confident in our trajectory for the year.\nNow let me hand it over to Jim who will share the details of the quarter and our expectations with you.\n\nJames J. Kavanaugh\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $14.2 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion of operating pretax income, operating earnings per share of $1.40 and $1.2 billion of free cash flow.\n90 days ago, I talked about the first quarter and the full year in the context of our medium-term model, which is to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and about $35 billion of free cash flow from 2022 through 2024. These first quarter results are a solid step toward delivering on the year and that model. Our revenue was up 11%. This includes over 5 points of incremental revenue from the commercial relationship established with Kyndryl last November.\nOur business, entering 2022, reflects a higher growth, higher value mix. It is also a business with more recurring revenue dominated by Software. This quarter, Software revenue was up 15%, and Consulting was up 17%. As we've discussed in the past, these are our 2 growth vectors, and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue.\nInfrastructure performance, which is influenced by product cycles, was flat as compared to last year. The Software and Infrastructure performance each include over 8 points from the commercial Kyndryl relationship. As a reminder, there is no incremental contribution to IBM Consulting's growth.\nOur strategy, as Arvind said, is based on a platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Not only do we benefit from the platform itself, but IBM and our partners also generate a multiple of Software and Consulting revenue on that platform. It's an attractive economic model. You can see our success in capturing that value in our hybrid cloud revenue, which was up 17% in the first quarter and over the last 12 months. Revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from infrastructure up through consulting represents $20.8 billion of revenue over the last 12 months or 36% of our total.\nLooking at our P&L metrics. We grew operating gross profit dollars, though margin was down, with improvement in software margin offset by consulting investments and infrastructure mix due to product cycles.\nFor operating pretax income, we grew profit dollars and expanded margins by 280 basis points. This profit performance reflects that we're capturing demand in high-value areas like software and profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship. We have taken actions to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model, consistent with our more focused, platform-centric business. With the more streamlined business, we're getting operating leverage from strong revenue performance.\nOur profit dynamics also reflect increasing investments in innovation, our ecosystem and talent. We're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We're investing in our ecosystem organically and inorganically. For example, one of the 3 acquisitions Arvind mentioned was Neudesic, which adds key hyperscale capabilities to address hybrid multi-cloud demand.\nAnd as we've discussed, over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively hiring. We're adding capabilities and skills to support our garages and client engineering centers, client success managers to help clients get the most of their IBM solutions and technical talent across our business. Now we're operating in an inflationary environment, and cost, especially the cost to attract and retain talent are escalating. We're addressing this through pricing, which will help over time.\nThe other item I'll mention is the impact of a strengthening dollar. We execute hedging programs, with the majority of our hedging gains reported in other income and expense. These gains mitigate the currency impact in revenue and gross profit.\nAnd then looking at net income, we expanded operating net income margin by 130 basis points. This reflects an operating tax rate of 16% which was up significantly from last year.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated $1.2 billion in the quarter. I'll remind you, we've gone back to our traditional all-in free cash flow definition, which includes payments for the structural actions initiated at the end of 2020. The $1.2 billion is about 12% of our full year expected range, consistent with history. The anomaly from that historic attainment was last year, with 23% of our full year free cash flow realized in the first quarter due to the unique dynamics of the Kyndryl separation.\nIn terms of uses of cash for the quarter, we invested about $700 million in acquisitions, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. We also issued $4 billion of debt in early February, which supports maturities later in the year. This results in a March cash position of $10.8 billion and debt of over $54 billion.\nTurning to the segments. Software delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. This includes over 8 points from the recurring Kyndryl software revenue, in line with our expectations. Software performance was driven by good growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the Kyndryl content.\nOur software is central to a hybrid cloud value proposition. Within the segment, hybrid cloud revenue is up 25%, now representing $8.8 billion over the last year. And subscription and support renewal rates grew again this quarter, contributing to a software deferred income balance of over $11 billion.\nHybrid Platform & Solutions revenue grew 10% this quarter, inclusive of about 1.5 points contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. We've driven focus within this portfolio around the most strategic hybrid cloud and AI needs of our clients, Red Hat, data and AI, automation and security. Growth was pervasive across all business areas this quarter.\nRed Hat revenue all in was up 21%. Revenue growth continues to be fueled by good performance across the Red Hat portfolio. And we again gained share across both RHEL and OpenShift, the foundational hybrid cloud offerings.\nRed Hat's hybrid cloud offerings continue to transform enterprise IT and deliver new innovations. For example, this quarter, we announced a new partnership with NVIDIA to accelerate AI applications. Automation delivered 5% revenue growth this quarter. Growth was led by AIOps and management and integration. We've invested in AI-powered approach to automation, and our solutions are resonating with clients as they address growing complexity, digital shifts and skill shortages across their businesses. We extended this AI-powered automation strategy this quarter, with the joint Flexera solution Arvind mentioned earlier.\nData & AI revenue grew 4%. These offerings help our clients accelerate data-driven agendas by connecting and governing all of their data and infusing AI to enhance decision-making. Performance this quarter reflects client demand across the portfolio, including continued adoption of data fabric, expansion of our Data Management footprint, a focus on sustainable operations with Asset & Supply Chain Management and needs for reliable data sharing with Information Exchange. We had growth in solutions like Cloud Pak for Data, Db2 and Maximo Application Suite, just to name a few.\nSecurity revenue grew 8%, building on strong performance in the first quarter of last year when we were up 14%. With the evolving cybersecurity environment, we delivered growth this quarter in Threat Management and Data Security. We continue to see good client demand for Cloud Pak for Security, an integrated and open security platform that advances client's zero trust strategy while leaving data where it is. And we've been investing in securing innovation, including a new SaaS endpoint solution following the ReaQta acquisition. Looking across the performance of our hybrid platform and solutions, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is up 9% year-to-year.\nTransaction Processing delivered 31% revenue growth this quarter, including 28 points from the Kyndryl content. The overall dynamics are much like last quarter. We wrapped on weak performance in the first quarter of last year, which was down 15%. And we continue to see strong renewals of these critical software offerings, building on the expanded zSystems capacity and traction we've gotten through the strong z15 program.\nLooking at software profit, we delivered operating leverage given the strong and broad-based revenue performance this quarter. Our pretax margin was up 7 points and puts us on track for our full year software margin in the mid-20s.\nJust as in Software, Consulting is capitalizing on strong demand profile, growing both revenue and signings at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Revenue growth accelerated to 17% while bookings were up over 40%. Our book-to-bill remains solid at 1.1 for the quarter and over the last year.\nClients trust IBM to execute their complex business transformation, leveraging our deep industry expertise and the investments we've been making in skills, capabilities, our ecosystem and in scaling our acquisitions. We are positioned to capture demand and drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform.\nConsulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% on a trailing 12-month basis to $8.3 billion, which makes up 45% of the Consulting business. We continue to see strong demand and momentum in our Red Hat-related engagements this quarter, nearly doubling Red Hat-related signings year-to-year.\nOur strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships grew solid double digits led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure.\nAnd now turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 19%, bringing together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. The growth was broad based with particularly strong growth in our practices centered around customer experience, talent, and data transformation as well as supply chain and finance applications.\nIn Technology Consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platform and strategies, revenue was up 19%. Growth was pervasive, led by our engagements around developing and modernizing applications for cloud deployments.\nFinally, Application Operations revenue grew 14%. This business line focuses on the management of applications and cloud platform services required to run hybrid cloud environments. Growth was broad based in this space as well, led by cloud application management.\nMoving to Consulting profit. Our pretax margin expanded about 1 point, delivering operating leverage and benefiting from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting gross margin reflects the significant investments we have made over the last year, fueling our revenue growth. We are investing in our partner ecosystem, expanding our reach. We continue to scale the 12 acquisitions we made in the last 18 months, including 2 which closed in the first quarter. And we're investing in talent across our workforce, up-skilling existing resources, adding certifications and bringing in technical skills in areas of hybrid cloud and AI.\nConsulting is where we are most impacted by the competitive and inflationary labor market, which puts pressure on profitability. We expect to capture value through price and our engagements and recognize it will take a few quarters to appear in our margin profile.\nTurning to Infrastructure segment. Revenue performance was flat versus last year. Hybrid infrastructure revenue declined 2%, offset by growth of 4% in infrastructure support. The Kyndryl content contributed over 8 points to Infrastructure with consistent benefit across the 2 business areas.\nWithin Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems revenue was down 18%, and, we're now in the 11th quarter of z15 availability. z15 has been a very strong program, both in revenue performance and capacity. In fact, we shipped more z15 MIPS than in any other program.\nBuilding on that momentum, we've just announced our newest solution, IBM z16. Arvind commented on the 3 differentiated capabilities of z16: embedded AI at scale; cyber resilience security; and cloud native development for hybrid cloud.\nDistributed Infrastructure delivered 8% revenue growth this quarter. Client demand for S/4HANA data-intensive workloads on our newest Power10 high-end systems fueled this performance.\nLooking at infrastructure profit. The pretax margin was down 3 points, reflecting where we are in our IBM zSystems product cycle.\nNow let me take it back up to the IBM level. We focused our business on a platform-centric, hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Over the last couple of years, we've been taking steps to optimize our portfolio, streamline our operations and allocate capital to execute that strategy and improve our financial profile. Our first quarter results reflect these very significant changes and put us on track to our full year expectations for our 2 key measures of revenue growth and free cash flow.\n90 days ago, we expected to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate at constant currency before the incremental Kyndryl sales. With a strong start to the year, we now see revenue growth at the high end of that mid-single-digit range. On top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth for the year from the commercial relationship of Kyndryl spread over the first 3 quarters. And then looking at currency, with the strengthening U.S. dollar at mid-April spot rates, currency will now be a 3- to 4-point headwind to revenue growth for the year.\nFor free cash flow, we continue to expect $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. As I said earlier, this is an all-in free cash flow definition and includes the cash impact associated with our 2020 structural actions.\nBefore getting into the segments and color on the second quarter, I'll comment on the business impact of our Russian operations. Our business in Russia is not large, but it's concentrated in high-end infrastructure and software. Last year, business in the country contributed about $300 million of revenue and about $200 million of profit and cash. For this year, we expect no contribution from Russia, which puts us closer to the low end of our free cash flow range.\nNow let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance for the year. In Software, we got off to a good start, and we haven't changed our view of constant currency revenue growth or the contribution from the external sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year. In IBM Consulting, with our first quarter revenue and signings performance, we are taking up our view of Consulting revenue to a low double-digit growth rate for the year. With continued investment in talent and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a pretax margin approaching 10%, which is up a couple of points year-to-year. This reflects improving performance in the second half as we realize price increases in our contracts.\nOur Infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. This year, we'd expect performance above the model given the launch of our z16 late in the second quarter. This will contribute to second quarter performance and ramp further in the second half.\nOn top of that, we're planning for about 4 to 5 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. We see a mid- to high-teens pretax margin for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics would yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. In terms of tax, we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth.\nLet me comment on a couple of items specific to the second quarter. At current spot rates, currency would be a 5-point headwind to revenue growth. We expect to close the sale of the health care software assets with a gain utilized to address stranded costs. And we expect a 4- to 5-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin and a tax rate in the high teens. Based on our solid first quarter performance and view of the year, we are on track to our mid-term model. And now Patricia, let's go to the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of IR, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nI'll remind you the separation of our Managed Infrastructure Services business, Kyndryl, was completed on November 3. As a result, our income statement is presented on a continuing operations basis. Our results also reflect the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl. Because this provides a onetime lift to our growth, we will provide the contribution to our revenue growth for the next year.\nIn the spirit of providing additional information to investors, our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC.\nFinally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results reinforce our confidence in our strategy and model. With solid revenue growth, we are on track to the mid-single-digit trajectory we had laid out in our investor briefing last October.\nThe trend we see is clear. Across industries, [clients] technology has a major source of competitive advantage. They realize that powerful technologies embedded at the heart of their business can lead to seismic shifts in the way they create value. This reality of technology being about a lot more than cost will persist and explains why clients are eager to leverage hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence to move their business forward.\nOur fourth quarter results illustrates the strong client demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. IBM Consulting again had double-digit revenue growth as our ecosystem play continues to gain momentum. Software revenue growth reflects strength in Red Hat and our automation offerings. Infrastructure had a good quarter, especially with regards to IBM Z and storage.\nOver the last 1.5 years, we have taken a series of actions to execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and improve our revenue profile, optimizing our portfolio, increasing investments, expanding our ecosystem and simplifying our go-to market. As we start to yield benefits from these actions, our constant currency performance improved through 2021.\nOur most significant portfolio action was the separation of Kyndryl. You will remember we had initially expected the spin by the end of the year, and we completed it in early November. As we discuss our results, we'll focus on the new basis and structure that encompasses today's IBM.\nAs we look to 2022, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year. Both of these are consistent with our medium-term model.\nLet me now spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the market, how we address it and the progress we are making. We are seeing high demand for our capabilities in several areas. Clients are eager to automate as many business class as possible, especially given the new employee demographics. This dynamic is likely to play out over the long term.\nThey are also using AI and predictive capabilities to mitigate friction in their supply chains. Cybersecurity remains a major area of concern as the cost of cybercrime already in the billions of dollars rises each year. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a partner they can trust and who has a proven track record in bringing about strategic transformation projects. This is why our strategy is focused on helping our clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and AI.\nHybrid cloud is about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private cloud and as-a-service properties that our clients typically have. Our approach is platform-centric, and the platform we have built is open, secure and flexible. And it provides a solid base of the multiplier effect across software and services for IBM and our ecosystem partners.\nIt starts with Red Hat, which offers clients unique software capabilities based on open source innovation. Our software, which has been optimized for that platform, helps our clients apply AI, automation and security to transform and improve their business workflows. Our consultants deliver deep business expertise and the cocreate with our clients to advance their digital transformation journeys. And our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment.\nThis strategy, along with the differentiated capabilities we bring to bear to our clients, have led to an increase in platform adoption and new business opportunities across the stack. We now have more than 3,800 hybrid cloud platform clients, which is up 1,000 clients from this time last year.\nIBM Consulting continues to help drive platform adoption, with about 700 Red Hat engagements for the year. Clients like [Dunn & Bradstreet], National Grid, AIB and Volkswagen have all recently chosen IBM's broad hybrid cloud and AI capabilities to transform their processes and move their business forward.\nAs I look back on the year, we had good success in broadening our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and to better respond to client needs. During our investor briefing, we talked about strategic partnerships that will yield billion-dollar businesses within IBM Consulting. As we move towards that, we had more than 50% revenue growth this year in partnerships with AWS, Azure and Salesforce. This adds to the strong strategic partnerships we have with others such as SAP, Oracle and Adobe.\nWe're continuing to broaden our ecosystem reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Salesforce to run new soft integration software on Red Hat OpenShift. We also created a host of new consulting services with SAP to help clients accelerate their journey to S/4HANA. Together with Deloitte, we announced [Dapper], an AI-enabled managed analytics solution. And we have expanded our partnership with EY to help organizations leverage hybrid cloud, AI and automation capabilities to transform HR operations. We have also recently announced a host of new strategic partnerships with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and (inaudible), all focused on the deployment of 5G, edge and network automation capabilities.\nDuring 2021, we have been making changes to increase our focus and agility and build a stronger client-centric culture. This includes putting experiential selling, client engineering and core creation at the heart of our client engagement model. We have completed thousands of IBM Garage engagements. And today, we have nearly 3,000 active engagements. We've invested in hundreds of customer success managers to help clients capture more value from our solutions. And we have upgraded our skills with fewer generalists and more technical specialists.\nThis is resonating well with our clients, and it's starting to contribute to our performance. The most important metric, of course, is revenue growth, but we are also pleased to see our client renewal rates increasing and our recurring revenue base growing. We are starting to see signs of sales productivity improvements, with average productivity per technology seller increasing from the first to the second half.\nAt the same time, innovations that matter to our clients remain a constant focus, and our teams have worked hard to deliver a series of important innovations in the past quarter.\nStarting with AI, we added new natural language processing enhancements to Watson Discovery. We're also combining and integrating products such as Turbonomic, Instana and Watson AIOps to offer a complete set of AI-powered automation software to address the significant demand. This quarter, Red Hat announced that the Ansible automation platform is now available on Microsoft Azure, bringing more flexibility to clients and how they adopt automation.\nIn partnership with Samsung Electronics, IBM announced a breakthrough that reorients how transistors are built upon the surface of a chip to enable tremendous increases in energy density. In [quantum], we unveiled [Eagle], 127-cubic quantum processor. This is the first quantum chip that breaks the 100-cubic barrier and represents a key milestone on our path towards building a 1,000-cubic processor in 2023.\nWhile organic innovations are important, we continue to acquire companies that complement and strengthen our portfolio. We made 5 acquisitions in the fourth quarter and a total of 15 acquisitions in 2021.\n2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Envizi. Many consumers are willing to pay more for products that are made by companies that are more environmentally sustainable. As the world continues to move towards a more circular economy, our clients' need is the ability to manage and measure their progress. Envizi's capabilities complement our own and help us respond to that client demand.\nSustainability is important across a number of stakeholder groups, including clients, employees and investors. We are continuing to make good progress and are particularly proud of our diversity and inclusion scores, and our ability to attract and retain talent.\nOur efforts were recently recognized by JUST Capital who named IBM as one of America's most JUST companies.\nLet me now close by emphasizing once again our fourth quarter results strengthen the conviction that we have in our ability to deliver our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Jim will take you through the fourth quarter and then provide more color on 2022. Jim, over to you.\n\nJames J. Kavanaugh\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, 58% operating gross margin, operating pretax income of $3.5 billion and operating EPS of $3.35 for continuing operations.\nLast January, we said we expected performance to improve over the course of 2021 as we start to benefit from the actions we've taken. We have seen progress in our constant currency revenue growth rate every quarter and now again in the fourth. This is the first view of IBM post separation.\nWe had solid revenue performance, up nearly 9%. I'll remind you, this includes the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, and we said we would be transparent on the contribution to our revenue growth for the first year. This quarter, our revenue growth includes about 3.5 points from the new relationship. Excluding this, IBM's revenue was up 5%.\nWe have aligned our operating model and segment structure to our platform-centric approach. In the fourth quarter, Software was up 10%, and Consulting was up 16%. These are our 2 growth factors and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. Infrastructure, more of a value vector, tends to follow product cycles and was up 2%. The Software and Infrastructure growth each include nearly 5 points from the new Kyndryl relationship while there is no contribution to Consulting's growth.\nOur platform-centric model has attractive economics. For every dollar of hybrid platform revenue, IBM and our ecosystem partners can generate $3 to $5 of software, $6 to $8 of services and $1 to $2 of infrastructure revenue. This drives IBM's hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 19% for the year. Post separation, revenue from our full-stack cloud capabilities from Infrastructure up through Consulting now represents $20 billion of revenue or 35% of our total.\nLooking at our P&L metrics. Our operating gross profit was up 3%, and the $3.5 billion of operating pretax profit was up over 100%. Operating net income and earnings per share also grew.\nLet me highlight a couple of items within our profit performance. First, the year-to-year pretax profit reflects $1.5 billion charge to SG&A last year for structural actions. To simplify and optimize our operating model and improve our go-forward position, we're continuing to invest to drive growth. Throughout the year, we have been aggressively hiring, with about 60% of our hires in Consulting. We're scaling resources and Garages, fine engineering centers and customer success managers, all to better serve our clients. We're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like [Quantum]. We're ramping investment in our ecosystem, and we acquired 15 companies in 2021 to provide skills and technologies aligned to our strategy, including capabilities to help win client architecture decisions.\nRegarding tax, our fourth quarter operating tax rate was 14%. This was up significantly from last year, but roughly 2 to 3 points lower than what we estimated in October due to a number of factors, including the actual product and geographic mix of our income in the quarter.\nLet me spend a minute on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. Our full year consolidated cash from operations was $12.8 billion, and free cash flow was $6.5 billion. These are all-in consolidated results and include 10 months of Kyndryl and the cash paid for the 2020 structural actions and spin charges.\nIBM's stand-alone or baseline free cash flow for the year was $7.9 billion, which is aligned to our go-forward business. This excludes Kyndryl charges and pre-separation activity, but includes the IBM portion of the structural actions. Payments for these IBM-related structural actions and deferred cash tax paid in 2021 contributed to the year-to-year decline in the stand-alone results.\nIn terms of uses of cash for the year, we invested over $3 billion in acquisitions. We continue to delever, with debt down nearly $10 billion for the year and over $21 billion since closing the Red Hat acquisition. And we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a year-end cash position of $7.6 billion, including marketable securities and debt of just under $52 billion.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and I'd say the same for our retirement-related plans. You'll remember that over the last years, we've shifted our asset base to a lower risk profile. In 2021, the combination of modest returns and higher discount rates improved the funded status of our plans. In aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 107% with the U.S. at 112%.\nNow I'll turn to the details by segment, and I'll remind you we have put in place a simplified management system and segment structure aligned to our platform-centric model. And within the segments, we're now providing new revenue categories and metrics that will provide greater transparency into business trends and drivers.\nIBM Software delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. This was driven by good revenue performance in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the new Kyndryl content. Software is important to our hybrid cloud strategy and our financial model. Our hybrid cloud revenue in software is up 25% for the year to more than $8.5 billion. And subscription and support renewal rates continue to grow again this quarter, contributing to a $700 million increase in the software deferred income balance over the last year. Hybrid platform and solutions revenue was up 9%. This performance is an indication of the strength across the software growth areas focused on hybrid cloud and AI. It's worth mentioning this includes only a point of help from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship.\nLet me highlight some of the trends by business area. Red Hat revenue all in was up 21%. Both infrastructure and App Dev and emerging tech grew double digits as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprise's critical hybrid cloud requirements. With this performance, we're continuing to take share with our Red Hat offerings.\nAutomation delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. As Arvind mentioned, there is strong market demand for automation. We had good performance in AIOps and management this quarter as we address resource management and observability. Clients are realizing rapid time to value from Instana and Turbonomic, 2 of our automation acquisitions. And integration grew with continued traction in Cloud Pak for Integration.\nData and AI revenue grew 3%. We have particular strength in data fabric, which enables clients to connect sideload data distributed across the hybrid cloud landscape without moving it. You'll recall, we talked about the data fabric opportunity back in October. We also had strong performance in business analytics and weather. Within these solutions, clients are leveraging our AI to ensure AI models are governed to operate in a fair and transparent manner.\nSecurity revenue declined modestly in the quarter driven by lower performance in data security, while revenue grew 5% for the year. As we called out in our recent investor briefing, security innovation is an integral part of our strategy. In December, we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, with further plans to modernize the broader portfolio throughout the year.\nThis quarter, we also completed the acquisition of ReaQta, which leverages AI and machine learning to automatically identify and block threats at the end point. Putting this all together, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is now over $13 billion, which is up 8% this quarter. This demonstrates the momentum in our hybrid platform and AI strategy, including Red Hat and our suite of Cloud Paks.\nMoving to transaction processing. Revenue was up 14%. This is above our model driven by a few underlying dynamics. First, all of the growth in transaction processing came from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship, which contributed more than 16 points of growth. Second, I'll remind you that we're wrapping on a very weak performance in the fourth quarter of last year, which was down 26%. And lastly, we had some large perpetual license transactions given the good expansion in the IBM Z capacity we've seen this cycle. While the new capacity is important, what's just as important is the continued strong renewal rates this quarter. These are both good proof points of our clients' commitment to our infrastructure platform and these high-value software offerings.\nLooking at software profit, we expanded pretax margin by 12 points, including nearly 10 points of improvement from last year's structural actions.\nTurning to Consulting. Revenue grew 16%, with acceleration across all 3 revenue categories. Complementing this strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill was 1.2. Clients are accelerating their business transformations, powered by hybrid cloud and AI to drive innovation, increase agility and productivity and capture new growth opportunities. Enterprises are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner on this journey. They are choosing us for our deep client, industry and technical expertise, which drives adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pulls through key technologies.\nConsulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 34% in the quarter. For the year, cloud revenue is up 32% to $8 billion. Offerings and application modernization, which are centered on Red Hat, contributed to this growth. The Red Hat-related signings more than doubled this year and are now over $4 billion since inception. This quarter, we added over 150 client engagements, bringing the total since inception to over 1,000.\nOur strategic partnerships also drove our performance. Revenue from these partnerships accelerated as the year progressed and was up solid double digits in the fourth quarter led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure.\nTurning to our business areas. Our Consulting's growth was led by business transformation, which was up 20%. Business transformation brings together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. To enable this, we leverage skills and capabilities in IBM technologies and with strategic ecosystem partners such as SAP, Salesforce and Adobe. Our practices are centered on areas such as finance and supply chain, talent, industry-specific solutions and digital design. This quarter, we had broad-based growth, reflecting strong demand for these solutions.\nIn technology consulting, revenue was up 19%. Technology consulting architects and implements cloud platforms and strategies. We leverage hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift and work with providers such as AWS and Azure in addition to IBM Cloud. This quarter, we continue to see good performance in application modernization offerings that build cloud native applications and that modernize existing applications for the cloud.\nFinally, application operations revenue grew 8%. This business line focuses on application and cloud platform services required to operationalize and run in both cloud and on-premise environments. Revenue growth was driven by offerings, which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments.\nMoving to consulting profit. our pretax income margin expanded about 8 points, including just over 9 points from last year's structural actions. We're in a competitive labor market, and we continue to have increased pressure on labor costs due to higher acquisition, retention and wages. While we still expect to capture this value in our engagements, it will take a few quarters to appear in our profit profile.\nSo now turning to the new Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 2%. The Kyndryl commercial relationship contributed about 5 points of growth, which is higher than we expected in October. In this segment, we brought together hybrid infrastructure with infrastructure support, which was formerly technology support services. This allows us to better manage the life cycle of our hardware platforms and to provide end-to-end value for our clients.\nHybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support revenue were up 2% and 1%, respectively, with pretty consistent contribution from the new Kyndryl relationship. Hybrid infrastructure includes IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. IBM Z revenue performance, now inclusive of both hardware and operating system, is down 4% this quarter. This is the 10th quarter of Z15 availability, and the combination of security, scalability and reliability continues to resonate with clients. This program continues to outpace the strong Z14 program, and we ship more MIPS in the Z15 program than any program in our history. Our clients are leveraging IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. And then in distributed infrastructure, revenue was up 7% driven by pervasive strength across our storage portfolio.\nLooking at infrastructure profit, the pretax margin was up over 9 points but essentially flat normalizing for last year's structural action.\nNow I'll wrap up with a discussion of how our investments and actions position us for 2022 and the longer term. We've been laser-focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our portfolio, our capital allocation and the moves we've been making are all designed to create value through focus for our clients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders.\nWe took significant steps during 2021. The most impactful portfolio action was, of course, the separation of Kyndryl. We've also been allocating capital to higher growth areas, investing in skills and innovation and expanding our ecosystem. We've aligned our business to a more platform-centric business model. And we're simplifying and redesigning our go-to-market to better meet client needs and execute on our growth agenda.\nBottom line, we're exiting 2021 a different company. We have a higher growth, higher value business mix, with over 70% of our revenue in software and services and a significant recurring revenue base dominated by software. This will result in improving revenue growth profile, higher operating margin, strong and growing free cash flow and lower capital intensity, leading to a higher return on invested capital business.\nWe also continue to have attractive shareholder returns through dividends. In October, we laid out a model for IBM's performance over the medium term, defined as 2022 through 2024. The model is focused on our 2 most important measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow.\nAs we enter the new year, I'll talk about our expectations for 2022 performance along those dimensions. Starting with revenue. We expect to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate at constant currency. That's consistent with the model. On top of that, in 2022, the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl will contribute an additional 3 points of growth spread across the first 3 quarters.\nCurrency dynamics, unfortunately, will be a headwind. At current spot rates, currency is roughly a 2-point headwind to reported revenue growth for the year and 3 points in the first quarter.\nFor free cash flow, we expect to generate $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. To be clear, this is an all-in free cash flow definition. The adjusted free cash flow view we provided in 2021 was useful given the significant cash impact associated with the separation and structural actions.\nNow in 2022, despite the fact we still have nearly $0.5 billion of impact from the charges, we're focusing on a traditional free cash flow definition. The $10 billion to $10.5 billion reflects a year-to-year improvement driven by lower payments for the structural actions, a modest tailwind from cash taxes, working capital improvements and profit growth resulting from our higher growth and higher value business mix. With this performance, we're on track to our model.\nSo now let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance. Because this is a new segment structure, I'm going to spend a little more time and provide perspective on constant currency revenue growth and pretax margin in the context of our segment models.\nIn Software, as we benefit from the investments in innovation and our go-to-market changes, we're seeing progress in our Software growth rate. In 2022, we expect growth at the low end of the mid-single-digit model and then another 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from our external sales to Kyndryl. We expect Software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year.\nWe have solid momentum in IBM Consulting revenue and expect this to continue into 2022 as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and our book-to-bill ratio support revenue at the high end of our high single-digit model for the year, with double-digit growth in the first half. We expect low double-digit pretax margin for the full year, with improving performance through the year as we make progress on price realization.\nInfrastructure revenue performance will vary with product cycle. In 2022, with a new IBM Z introduction late in the first half, we expect performance above the model and a slight contribution to IBM's overall growth. On top of that, we're planning for about 2 to 3 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. This supports a high-teens pretax margin rate for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics will yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax operating margin for the full year and 2 to 3 points in the first quarter.\nIn terms of tax, we expect a mid- to high teens tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. Bringing this all together, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year, both in line with our midterm model.\nPatricia, let's go to the Q&A.\n\nPatricia Murphy\n\nVP of IR, International Business Machines Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. In addition to our regular materials, we've included a summary of our new segments for your reference and historical data on segment pretax income.

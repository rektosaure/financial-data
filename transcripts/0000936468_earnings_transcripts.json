Today's call is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria A. Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sarah, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Evan Scott, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStatements made today that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see Lockheed Martin's SEC filings, including our 2024 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, American Tower Corp.\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2025 earnings call.\nLockheed Martin delivered strong operational and financial performance across all 4 of our business areas in the quarter. We secured a number of significant wins across a range of our marquee programs that drove our backlog to a record high of $179 billion. Our relentless attention to operational execution in every facet of our business resulted in elevated sales growth and substantial cash generation as well. Meanwhile, we're also positioning the company for what we see as even greater demand for the iconic Lockheed Martin products and systems needed by the U.S. and its allies to ensure deterrence from potential great power arm conflict.\nAs I have said, Lockheed Martin is in the aerospace and defense industry, but in the deterrence business. We are in active discussions with our customers in both the U.S. and abroad on scaling up development and production of the essential elements to deliver on the goal of peace through strength. These systems include air defense radars and missiles, space-based interceptors, state-of-the-art open architecture command and control systems and the world's most advanced fighter aircraft as just a few examples. In every step of the way, we remain highly focused on enhancing program performance in terms of cost, quality and schedule while reducing risk to internal production systems modernization and continuous improvement methods.\nAs noted, in the third quarter, we achieved record backlog of $179 billion as demand for our reliable advanced solutions remain solid. Multiyear awards on PAC-3, JASSM/LRASM and CH-53K totaled $30 billion in the quarter and provide production rate visibility into the next decade. And shortly after the conclusion of the quarter, we definitized the F-35 Lot 18 and 19 contract with the Department of War's joint program office adding $11 billion of contract value and another 151 aircraft into backlog.\nOur financial results in the third quarter reflect these trends. Sales increased 9% year-over-year and a solid 5% normalized for the Lot 18, 19 impact in last year's third quarter. We generated strong free cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter enabling our commitment to further invest in the business while simultaneously driving returns to shareholders through recurring dividends and our disciplined share repurchase program.\nEarlier in October, our Board approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend and increased our share repurchase authorization. This marks the 23rd consecutive year of dividend increase for the company and demonstrates our continued confidence in Lockheed Martin's stable financial performance. Looking forward, we are updating our outlook for the remainder of 2025, increasing expectations for sales segment operating profit and earnings per share. We remain focused on operational performance and capitalizing on the unprecedented demand cycle to deliver mid-single-digit top line growth in 2025 while generating $6.6 billion of free cash flow. Evan will provide additional detail on the free cash flow elements and our full year outlook in his prepared remarks.\nCircling back to the new business we secured this quarter. At Missiles & Fire Control, our expertise in developing and producing reliable precision strike weapons and integrated air and missile defense solutions at scale continues to be highly valued by our customers. First on PAC-3, the U.S. Army awarded Lockheed Martin a $9.8 billion contract for the production of nearly 2,000 PAC-3 MSE interceptors, and associated hardware. This marks the largest contract in MSE history and demonstrates the sustained demand for this advanced and proven interceptor from U.S. and international partners, some of which you've read is latest this week in the press. Our teams continue to proactively partner with suppliers and customers to invest in PAC-3 capabilities and production capacity to support the elevated and enduring demand we see for this critical mission, defending against ballistic, cruise, hypersonic and airborne threats.\nNext, on JASSM and LRASM, we definitized a large lot procurement contract for $9.5 billion with the U.S. Air Force and Navy customers. This multiyear award supports increased production quantities of these proven cruise missile systems and helps build a more resilient industrial base. We look forward to partnering with the U.S. government to execute and deliver this long-range, highly survival and effective capability to our airmen, sailors and marines for years to come.\nMoving to Rotary & Mission Systems. The U.S. Navy awarded Sikorsky a $10.9 billion multiyear contract to build up to 99 CH-53K King Stallion helicopters for the U.S. Marine Corps over 5 years. This is the largest quantity order to date for that aircraft and the largest contract award ever in RMS history. This ensures consistent deliveries of America's most powerful heavy lift helicopter into the next decade and enables long-term affordability, optimized production efficiency and stability for our supply chain. In our space portfolio, we received additional contract value and funding on the next-generation interceptor program in the quarter, helping to increase backlog for our space business to a new high of $38 billion.\nWith NGI, we continue to advance the program as we're progressing development and begin preparing for production. In addition, our space team secured multiple contract research and development awards this quarter. These crowd awards is their known demonstrate our ability to co-invest with the government partners and accelerate the delivery of revolutionary solutions with each crowd initiative strategically targeted to support key missions for the U.S. government.\nAlso of note in the quarter, the Fleet Ballistic Missile, or FBM system, conducted yet another successful flight test demonstrating its continued readiness to provide the world's most potent and survivable nuclear deterrent. This also marks 70 years of Lockheed Martin support to the U.S. Navy on this critical program. Going forward, both NGI and FBM will benefit from the internal investment we are making in new state-of-the-art facilities to enable rapid, reliable and cost-effective component production and assembly for these crucial systems. All in, these awards underscore the trust and confidence that our customers place in us and which in turn, underpins our company's long-term solid growth prospects.\nShifting gears to F-35. During the third quarter, we delivered 46 aircraft and now expect between 175 and 190 deliveries in 2025. That's essentially 1 aircraft delivery every working day of the year. Since program inception, we've delivered over 1,200 F-35 aircraft that have amassed over 1 million flight hours, providing control of the sky and seamless interoperability between U.S. and allied forces. The recent Lot 18 and 19 award reemphasizes the growing demand for the F-35, which is the world's most advanced fighter jet currently in production. Over the years to come, the U.S. and 19 international allies will continue to progress toward a planned global fleet of over 3,500 aircraft. Moreover, we finalized the $15 billion air vehicle sustainment contract with the Joint Program Office. The 4-year deal provides for aftermarket activities such as spare parts provisioning, maintenance, repair and other support services through 2028. This long-term agreement will support our key objective to improve the readiness of the aircraft fleet as it continues to expand in number and supports the revenue growth trajectory for our F-35 sustainment business.\nFinally, we are also heavily committed to support the ongoing modernization and upgrade of the aircraft's capabilities, particularly the introduction of what's known as Block IV enhancements to a number of aircraft systems. At the same time, Lockheed Martin has already moved out on engineering analysis at my direction to design and bring even more advanced capabilities from our sixth generation research and development efforts that we conducted our Skunk Works operation in California. We are aspiring to enhance the relevance and capability of our fifth generation platforms, the F-35 and the F-22 to provide the greatest aggregate level of air superiority capability at the most efficient cost and the fastest deployment.\nThis is a total best value approach that we think will be best for the department. To that end, we are working closely with our customers to align our internal investments with their most important mission priorities for the F-35. For example, of the strategic enhancements could include advanced and expanded weapons compatibility, improved data links, autonomous drone wingmen integration, superior sensors and the latest electronic warfare capabilities.\nNow turning to the budget. We're all watching Congress work through the FY '26 appropriation bills and the government shutdown. We continue to see broad support through all of this for national defense priorities given the unsettled geopolitical situation. The strength of our backlog reflects the importance of Lockheed Martin systems and deterring global conflict. We will continue to partner with the administration, Congress and our customers to provide the absolute best defense technologies as this budget process is finalized.\nThe Homeland Defense mission, including Golden Dome for America is one opportunity for which Lockheed Martin is ready and well positioned with existing products, expertise and production capabilities. Although details of the initiatives architecture and acquisition plan continue to take shape, the space domain is expected to play a vital role, and Lockheed Martin continues to make significant progress to advanced space-based defense.\nEarlier this quarter, the first next-gen GEO, or NGG, missile warning system satellite was successfully completed. It's finished environmental testing, it's on track to provide the next level of global surveillance and detection of missile threats from space. We also submitted proposals for space-based interceptors and other emerging technologies and we're actually planning for a real on-orbit space-based interceptor demonstration by 2028. Further, led by RMS, Lockheed Martin has built a prototyping environment at our Center for Innovation in Virginia to support the collaborative development of a Golden Dome for America command and control capability.\nThrough a series of demonstrations, Lockheed Martin's open systems architecture is already using existing and new C2 capabilities from seabed to space. And importantly, these capabilities are not limited to our own. We have a broad team of industry partners that are participating in the prototype system development, ensuring that the U.S. government has access to the best available solution for each element of the eventual Golden Dome command and control system. At the same time, we're rapidly increasing production capacity across the missiles, sensors, battle management systems and satellite integration opportunities that will be directly relevant to achieve the overarching objective of Golden Dome, and that is to strengthen deterrence against an attack against the U.S. Homeland and if necessary, defeat it.\nI'll now turn it over to Evan to share more about our financial results before we open up the call to your questions.\n\nEvan T. Scott\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financials and highlight a handful of operational items in the quarter before handing it off to Maria who will cover business results, and then I'll come back to discuss the updated 2025 outlook.\nStarting on Chart 4. Third quarter sales were $18.6 billion, up 9% year-over-year, driven by Aeronautics, Missiles & Fire Control and space. Adjusting for the F-35 Lot 18 award timing impact on revenue in Q3 of last year, the normalized year-over-year growth was still a solid 5%. Next, segment operating profit of $2 billion was up 9% year-over-year, resulting in 10.9% segment margins. Similar to sales, adjusting for F-35, the normalized growth was 5%.\nMoving to earnings per share. We generated $6.95 in the third quarter, up $0.15 year-over-year primarily driven by the higher segment earnings and lower share count, partially offset by lower total FAS/CAS pension adjustment and a higher tax rate.\nTaking a closer look at taxes, while the 16.5% effective rate in the quarter was up from the prior year, it was considerably lower than our prior estimate. The primary driver of the lower rate was increased research and development credits related to prior year favorable federal income tax audit resolutions. Overall, these benefits reduced the effective tax rate this quarter with favorability expected to carry through to the full year.\nAs Jim mentioned, in the third quarter, we saw strong bookings across the business, totaling over $31 billion in orders, resulting in a 1.7 book-to-bill ratio. And we're off to a strong start to 4Q with the F-35 Lot 18, 19 award, additional funding associated with the PAC-3 multiyear award and the contract modification on the TRITON2 D5 [indiscernible] missile life extension.\nShifting to cash. We generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to over $4.1 billion. The strength in the quarter was driven by working capital improvement, mainly on the F-35 program as part of the planned payments associated with the Lot 18 and 19 agreement. Lower cash tax payments also helped as we roll through to the OPBA impacts.\nFinally, looking at cash deployment in the quarter, we continue to fund organic growth and innovation efforts with approximately $900 million going to capital expenditures and internal research and development activities. In addition, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total year-to-date to $4.6 billion or 110% of free cash flow.\nWe remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation policy and accordingly remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Turning to some other highlights in the quarter. At Aeronautics, in addition to the F-35 Lot 18, 19 award Jim previously mentioned, international demand for the jet remained strong, with Belgium and Denmark, both announcing intentions to expand their fleets. Belgium seeking to procure an additional 11 aircraft and Denmark expressing interest in adding 16 aircraft to their existing program of record. The steady demand from our international allies for the F-35 demonstrates the unmatched capability of the aircraft and gives us confidence in sustained long-term production.\nAs for the classified program at Aeronautics, we will continue to proactively monitor and manage the risks and opportunities, and there were no additional charges recorded on the program in the quarter. Within MSC, we continue to advance our international strategy. The Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System, or GMARS program, completed a major milestone, launching 2 [ GMARS ] rounds at a live fire event at a white sands missile range, validating the launchers performance and ability to integrate the MLRS Family Munitions, or MFM. This successful test demonstrates Lockheed Martin's ability to adapt to regional needs in Europe and partner to create something new. Our precision fires launcher that is interoperable with NATO assets. We expect programs like GMAR to support the long-term international growth we anticipate within MFC and across the broader portfolio through the end of the decade.\nMoving to RMS and building upon Jim's comments regarding our work at the Center for Innovation related to Golden Dome, another growth prospect in the integrated and scalable C2 domain is the next-generation command and control or NGC 2 program. Lockheed Martin was awarded a prototype agreement to partner with the U.S. Army and serve as a team lead to develop a data-centric NGC 2 prototype. RMS will spearhead the collaborative effort, leveraging our C2 systems engineering and project management expertise to empower nontraditional innovators and commercial technology providers to scale their capabilities into our NGC 2 offering.\nFinally, space performed very well in the quarter, meeting key milestones on FBM, classified national security space, OPIR and GPS 3. On GPS, the ninth vehicle was transported to Cape Canaveral at the end of September. And more recently, Lockheed Martin delivered our first of 21 vehicles for space development agencies, transport layer, Tranche 1 program. Successful program execution events like these have helped space once again deliver strong profit in the quarter, resulting in segment margins of 9.9%. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\n\nMaria A. Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Evan. Okay. Starting with Aeronautics on Chart 5. Third quarter sales at Arrow increased 12% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher volume on F-35 production and sustainment contracts as well as the absence of the $700 million impact of Lot 18, 19 contract delays in last year's third quarter. The increase was partially offset by lower volume at classified programs. Adjusting for last year's Lot 18, 19 award timing impact, sales at aero would have increased 1%. Segment operating profit increased 3% year-over-year in the third quarter to $682 million. The benefit of the profit on the higher volume was partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments, which included an unfavorable adjustment of $40 million on C-130 programs this quarter.\nThe photo to the right showcases Lockheed Martin [indiscernible], a Group 5 survivable and lethal collaborative combat aircraft with a highly capable, customizable and affordable, agile drone framework. Similar to the common multi-mission truck, this is another example of Lockheed Martin internally funding development of advanced technologies, in this case, to create autonomous air dominance force multipliers to help customers outpace threats.\nTurning to Missiles & Fire Control on Chart 6. Sales at MFC in the quarter increased 14% from the prior year to $3.6 billion, driven by higher volumes due to production ramps including for multiple tactical and strike missile programs, such as JASSM/LRASM and PrSM as well as for integrated air and missile defense programs, primarily PAC-3. PAC-3 picture to the right, continues to ramp production with the program eclipsing $2 billion in sales year-to-date, which is 18% higher than last year. Segment operating profit in Q3 improved by 12% year-over-year to $510 million, driven by the profit associated with the higher volume.\nShifting to Rotary & Mission Systems on Chart 7. Sales at RMS were comparable year-over-year in the quarter at $4.4 billion, primarily driven by higher volumes on Sikorsky Black Hawk and various C6ISR programs. These increases were mostly offset by lower volume at integrated warfare systems and sensors and various training, logistics and simulation programs. Operating profit at RMS increased 5% in the third quarter versus prior year, primarily due to favorable contract mix at Sikorsky. The photo here is of the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion, which as previously mentioned, received the largest award in RMS history during the third quarter.\nAnd on Chart 8, we'll conclude the business area discussion with space. Space sales increased 9% year-over-year in the third quarter due to higher volumes at strategic and missile defense, driven by FBM and NGI programs as well as that national security space. FBM picture to the right, continues to benefit from the Life Extension 2 activities with sales up 14% year-to-date and driving accretive growth for the Space segment. Space operating profit increased 22% compared to Q3 2024. This increase was driven by favorable net profit booking rate adjustments primarily on FPM as well as profit associated with the higher sales volumes. Equity earnings from United Launch Alliance, ULA, were essentially flat versus prior year. Now I'll turn it back over to Evan.\n\nEvan T. Scott\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Maria. Turning to Chart 9 and our outlook for 2025. As we approach year-end, we refined our estimates to reflect increased expectations for sales segment operating profit and earnings per share as well as clarifying our intentions on free cash flow and deployment activities. Building off the solid year-to-date growth, we're tightening the sales guidance range to $74.25 billion to $74.75 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint and implying 5% organic growth year-over-year. We now expect segment operating profit to be in the range of $6.675 billion to $6.725 billion, maintaining a midpoint margin of 9%. Business area detail can be found on Chart 14 and backup Appendix 2, but I'll touch on it briefly now. Three of the 4 business areas, Aero, MFC and Space are increasing their outlook for sales by a combined $750 million, largely based on solid year-to-date performance and improved clarity on cost timing, production ramps and throughput expectations in Q4.\nMeanwhile, RMS is lowering its forecast for sales by $500 million due to lower expected cost volume and slower production ramps at Sikorsky. Profit changes are generally in line with sales. Back to the company level, on earnings per share, we are increasing our estimate to a range of $22.15 to $22.35, incorporating the $50 million of incremental segment mark operating profit as well as lower estimated full year tax rate, now estimated to be approximately 16.7%. And as our release stated, the EPS outlook excludes any noncash impacts from the conversion of pension annuity contracts that are currently under evaluation and could occur as early as the fourth quarter.\nTurning to cash. we've shifted to a point estimate for our cash flow guidance this quarter. We have line of sight to solid cash generation through the end of the year and we intend to direct any incremental cash generated above the $6.6 billion free cash flow estimate for 2025 towards prefunding a portion of the required $1 billion pension contribution in 2026. Our goal is to build financial flexibility in 2026 and beyond to ensure we are best positioned to seize organic growth opportunities and create value for shareholders.\nIn summary, on Chart 10, as Jim said, we're excited about the prospects for Lockheed Martin. We remain laser-focused on executing our record backlog to deliver on program commitments and drive favorable outcomes that create value for our customers and shareholders. With that, Sarah, let's open up the call for Q&A.",

Today's call is being recorded. If you would like to ask a question, please press star and one now. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone [Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations] Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you, Sarah and good morning.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 2025 earnings call. I'm going to cover four things today: our quarterly results, details of the recent effectiveness of our systems and platforms in combat operations, the current status of the budget and customer environment, and an update on the F-35 program. The recent highly effective performance of many mission-critical Lockheed Martin systems has resulted recently in our customers' direction to accelerate the scaling of production as well as the development of some advanced technologies. At the same time, our ongoing program review process identified new developments that caused us to reevaluate the financial position on a set of major legacy programs. Evan Scott, in his new position, led this review, which was also informed by concurrent customer inputs and negotiations, current operational performance, and future risk profiles.\nAs a result, we are this quarter taking a number of charges to address these newly identified risks and prepare the company to fully focus on the growth opportunity we expect as a result of heightened interest and demand for Lockheed Martin's products and technologies. As to our quarterly results, as you saw in our press release this morning, we reported $18 billion of sales, invested $800 million in infrastructure and innovation for growth, and returned $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the Q2. We also recognized losses of $1.8 billion across several legacy programs as a result of the deepened review process that I just described and also a tax matter. The actions that we have taken this quarter follow multi-year concerted, long-term efforts to improve these programs' performance in light of the original contractual terms.\nWe are dedicated to both supporting our customers' national defense priorities while striving to maintain our contractual commitments in an economically viable way on behalf of you, our shareholders, as well. We take these financial charges very seriously and are redoubling our focus on program management and performance under existing contracts across the company, while also ensuring that all future contracts more robustly assess and account for future program and technical risks. Starting with Sikorsky's Turkish Utility Helicopter Program or TUHP, and the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program, CMHP. In Q2, the leadership teams for these two programs held a series of direct, in-depth discussions with their respective customers. And as a result, recognized losses when we revised the cost and sales estimates for these programs.\nFor TUHP, we've reached a notional agreement to restructure the program, including a charge of a change of scope of work due to the impacts of US government sanctions on Turkish entities and persons involved in that program. For CMHP, we are focused on providing additional mission capabilities, enhancing logistical support, and extending the fleet's life while we continue discussions to potentially restructure certain contractual terms. Turning to the classified program at Aeronautics, our mission at Skunk Works pushes the boundaries of science and technology to deliver highly advanced solutions that provide our customers a step function advantage over potential adversaries. This particular program team discovered new insights in the quarter that required us to adjust our expected future costs on that program and then recognized the charge for doing so.\nI acknowledge the losses on this classified program are significant. Again, we are taking these charges very seriously and have initiated changes in program team management, and assigned experts across the company to approve the performance and oversight of this program under a comprehensive risk identification and corrective action plan. This is a highly classified program that can only be described as game-changing capability for our joint US and international customers and therefore it is critical that it be successfully fielded. With our enhanced oversight of this program and rapid incorporation of lessons learned, we expect to continue to reduce risk over the next few years as we move through the key milestones of this very advanced system. The criticality of our work was made clear last month in a high-stakes demonstration of modern deterrence and combat readiness. Lockheed Martin's capabilities were at the center of recent US military operations in the Middle East reinforcing the company's essential role to American and allied national security.\nPilots flying the F-35 Lightning II and the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters led the operation providing the air dominance and defense suppression required for the bombers to reach Iran's hardened nuclear sites. Our platforms operated essentially undetected in highly defended and contested airspace, underscoring the value of advanced stealth, superior electronic warfare, and broadband communications capabilities. This tactical success was a real-world confirmation of Lockheed Martin's leading role in combat-proven air power. Our capabilities were also integral to safely and 100% effectively defending American troops. When Iran retaliated with a salvo of ballistic missiles on US forces stationed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, our PAC-3 missiles successfully intercepted the incoming threats.\nThis engagement, executed by the Patriot missile system, occurred in a region also supported by THAAD, our Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and Aegis. These systems form a multiple-layered defense shield, protecting US strategic assets and our allied nations in the Middle East. This moment was one of several recent real-world events that validated the operational reliability of our integrated air and missile defense portfolio and underscored its scalability in joint and allied operations, including the ability to coordinate closely with our regional partners like the Qatar-Emiri Air Defense Forces. These are the exact solutions needed to make Golden Dome for America a reality. Lockheed Martin is the mission integrator with ready-now capabilities across all phases of the missile defense mission to support this essential program.\nIn addition to THAAD, PAC-3, and Aegis performing in combat, we also demonstrated our readiness in the missile warning and command-and-control technologies needed to make Golden Dome Homeland Defense System a reality. In addition, and in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency, we successfully executed a breakthrough flight test recently. The Lockheed Martin Long-Range Discrimination Radar or LRDR, successfully detected and tracked a representative live ballistic missile threat. The system then integrated the data into the MDA's missile defense system. Lockheed Martin is the national team lead for this missile defense network known as C2BMC. We can leverage this experience as well as our expertise in space satellite reconnaissance, tracking and communications, and the next-generation interceptor to rapidly deliver homeland defense capabilities for Golden Dome. Our major systems and platforms are performing very effectively in actual combat operations and thereby contributing today to global deterrence.\nThese achievements reinforce their relevance in the budget process as well as ongoing discussions with the administration. For example, the US government's focus on securing the homeland and deterring aggressors will lead to a significant increase in munitions spending over the coming years. I'll provide a few examples of that in a moment. In addition, cornerstone platforms like the F-35 and CH-53K remain not just relevant but essential to national security of the United States and its allies due to their unique range, payload, and other capabilities. As part of the FY26 budget request, the US Navy marked its intent to purchase PAC-3 for the first time, an important step for PAC-3/Aegis integration. This is the result of several years of internal investment at Lockheed Martin and a successful flight test last year.\nMoreover, the US Army has requested quadrupling the production of PAC-3 missiles, and we are also in discussions with the administration about scenario planning to increase the production rate of a number of other munitions and launchers significantly and quickly. Hypersonics have also been elevated in priority. The President's fiscal year 2026 budget request included nearly $400 million for production of the Air Launch Rapid Response Weapon or ARROW, the United States' first proven hypersonic weapon capable of being launched from an American aircraft. This program is a great example of the kind of speed and agility we can achieve. Less than a year after Lockheed Martin began rapidly developing this program, ARROW had its first flight test. We have full confidence in the maturity and production readiness of ARROW's hypersonic strike capabilities, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with the US Air Force to transition the program into production.\nAlso, in the hypersonic arena, in May, the US Navy publicized a successful end-to-end flight test of our Conventional Prompt Strike or CPS, missile from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This test marked the first launch of CPS using the Navy's cold gas launch approach that will be used in sea-based hypersonic fueling. Further, the US Coast Guard in its budget included additional MH-60 Romeos, new ships with Lockheed Martin C2 systems and C-130Js. More recently in July, we reached a price agreement with the US Navy on a five-year multi-year procurement for CH-53K, lots 9 to 13, and that'll be for a minimum of 85 aircraft. The award is targeted for late in Q3, with initial deliveries commencing in 2029. Before I hand it over to Evan, I'd like to provide an update on the status of the F-35 program.\nWe delivered 50 aircraft in the quarter, bringing our total F-35 deliveries to 97 so far this year and to 207 since we resumed deliveries last year. We also remain on track for 170 to 190 deliveries this year 2025. We have completed TR-3 hardware integration, and earlier this month, we released new software to the fleet, continuing our maturation and fielding of advanced Block IV capabilities. This update improves the pilot interface and provides additional weapons and electronic warfare features. We're also continuing to see strong international demand for the F-35. The UK announced its plans to procure 12 F-35As as part of its program of record. Belgium also announced that it will be adding 11 aircraft to their fleet, and government officials from Denmark have expressed their intent to procure additional aircraft as well.\nFinally, I want to take a moment to commend the DOD's recently announced investment in rare earth mining and magnet production right here in the United States. Led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Steve Feinberg and with the strong support of Secretary of Defense Hegseth and, of course, President Trump, this groundbreaking public-private partnership will ensure the supply of rare earth magnets needed in F-35s, cruise missiles, and countless other defense and non-defense applications. I'll turn it over to Evan now to share more about our financial results.\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financial results for the Q2, then hand off to Maria, who will cover business area financials, and I'll come back at the end to discuss our updated outlook. Starting on chart four, Q2 sales were $18.2 billion, comparable year-over-year and up sequentially from the Q1.\nWe saw strong growth on missile programs within MFC on F-35 production at Aeronautics and on strategic missiles within space partially offset by the impact of the charges at Aeronautics and RMS. More on those in a moment. Excluding the charges, sales increased in the mid-single-digit range continuing the solid underlying growth from the Q1 and setting us up well to achieve our four-year goal. Looking at segment operating profit of $570 million, Jim mentioned the $1.8 billion in total charges while the operational portion of the losses hit that segment operating profit was $1.6 billion related to the charges at Skunk Works and Sikorsky, with the impairment and tax item falling below the line.\nFirst, the Aeronautics classified program. As Jim mentioned, the process, control, and resource changes we implemented following Q4 2024 along with additional performance data on the program resulted in new insights that led us to recognize an incremental $950 million of reach-forward loss in Q2. To provide more detail, we have experienced design, integration, and test challenges, as well as other performance issues on this program. Those challenges and performance issues continued into 2025 and had a greater impact on scheduling costs than previously estimated.\nAs a result, we performed a comprehensive review of the design, integration, test, and other processes to achieve the technical requirements of the program. Based on this review and ongoing discussions with the customer and teammates, we made a significant change to our processes and testing approach, resulting in a significant update to the program schedule and cost estimates.\nBased on this, we believe that recognizing this incremental charge is a prudent continuation of the comprehensive corrective actions and risk mitigation approach we implemented at the start of the year, which continues to demonstrate solid progress. Our continued investment in this program reflects our ongoing confidence in its criticality for national security, and we remain excited about the future prospects for the solution.\nNext, on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program or CMHP, we've been in negotiations with the Canadian government for some time now attempting to reach a mutually beneficial solution. Based on recent conversations, the company made a decision to provide enhanced capability to upgrade the baseline fleet, improving helicopter utilization and probability of recovery as part of our flight-hour-based support contract over the coming years. These actions resulted in the company recognizing a $570 million loss this quarter. Lastly, the Turkish Utility Helicopter Program or TUHP. US Government sanctions on Turkish entities and persons have affected the company's ability to perform under this program. We've been communicating with the prime contract customer regarding alternative paths and during Q2 the company recognized a $95 million loss reflecting the latest status of those discussions.\nI recognize that these additional charges are disappointing. We have a focused team engaged with these programs on a daily basis. Actively implementing our adjusted approach and working to prevent charges like this going forward. We continue to learn, and the fact is these are important, although challenging programs, and Lockheed Martin has a long legacy of innovation and navigating complex issues. We're confident over the long term that we'll be able to manage these issues and continue extending our track record of delivering for the customer and our shareholders.\nAs part of our ongoing review process and as I've stepped into the CFO role, we've added rigor to our existing program management controls and processes, engaging subject matter experts from across the corporation, holding regular independent review teams, and increasing oversight, especially in cases where there are known technical complexities, contractual nuances, and other unique execution challenges. The lessons learned here are being shared to ensure our risk identification and mitigation efforts are optimized across the portfolio. Moving to earnings per share, our GAAP results were 1.46 in the quarter, inclusive of the impacts from the program losses previously mentioned, as well as impairment charges related to the NGAD decision and a reserve for uncertain tax position. In total, these items reduced EPS by $5.83.\nOn the tax item, the IRS now asserts that we owe $4.6 billion of additional income tax associated with a tax accounting method change we made in conjunction with the ASC 606 implementation and the 2017 tax legislation. The IRS initially approved our method changes, accepting our interpretation and application of the law, but later withdrew those acceptances. We stand by our tax accounting method being accurate and are pursuing remedies through the IRS Independent Office of Appeals and if necessary, through a judicial proceeding. We are accruing interest of $100 million in our income tax expense as part of our further evaluation of this matter. Moving to cash, Q2 free cash flow was a usage of $150 million. Our operating cash flow was impacted by a few notable timing items in the quarter.\nFirst, the delay of the combined F-35 Lot 18 19 award created approximately $600 million of headwind within working capital. Second, we realized quarter-to-date tariff impacts of approximately $100 million. And lastly, we ended Q2 with an uncharacteristically high receivables balance due to milestone and collection timing. We attribute most of these slower collections to timing, and we've collected a majority of the amount we had expected to collect in Q2 during the first week of July. In addition, we anticipate the F-35 Lot 18 19 award in Q3 will liquidate a significant balance from contract assets. Finally, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends, and share repurchases as part of our dynamic and disciplined capital deployment strategy. This is in addition to the continued reinvestment in the business that Jim detailed earlier. Now I'll hand it over to Maria to discuss the business area results in more detail.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Evan. Okay, starting with Aeronautics on chart five. Q2 sales at Aero increased 2% year-over-year to $7.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes on F-35, mainly on production contracts, and was partially offset by $360 million of lower volume from the classified program loss. Excluding the impact of the classified program loss, sales would have been up mid-single digits year over year. Segment operating profit decreased significantly year over year in Q2, primarily due to the $950 million loss on a classified program. Excluding the impact of the classified program loss in both periods, segment operating profit would have increased high single digits.\nTurning to missiles and fire control on chart six, sales at MFC in the quarter increased 11% from the prior year to $3.4 billion, driven by higher volume on multiple tactical and strike missile programs, including JASSM, LRASM, HIMARS, and PrSM. Segment operating profit in Q2 improved by 6% year-over-year to $479 million, driven by higher volume and favorable mix. Lower profit rate adjustments on PAC-3 partially offset this growth. The photo on the right shows a THAAD. In addition to THAAD's performance in combat that Jim talked about, we delivered the eighth THAAD battery to the US government in the quarter. Shifting to rotary and mission systems on chart seven, sales at RMS declined 12% in the quarter to $4 billion, primarily driven by the loss impacts of $305 million related to the CMHP and TUHP programs at Sikorsky.\nExcluding the program loss impacts, sales at RMS would have declined mid-single digits year over year due to lower volume on Seahawk Programs at Sikorsky and on the Canadian Surface Combatant Program at Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors. Operating profit at RMS decreased significantly in Q2 versus prior year due to the CMHP and TUHP Program losses of $665 million. Excluding these program losses, operating profit at RMS would have been comparable year-over-year. The picture to the right shows an LRDR, which recently performed a breakthrough flight test, as Jim mentioned. On chart eight, we'll wrap up the business area discussion with space. Space sales increased 4% year-over-year due to higher volume at commercial civil space, primarily on the Orion Program and at strategic, and missile defense, driven by next-generation interceptor and fleet ballistic missile programs.\nThis growth was partially offset by a decrease at national security space. Space operating profit increased 5% compared to Q2 2024. This increase was driven by higher profit booking rate adjustments, primarily due to favorable performance on commercial civil space program. Equity earnings from United Launch Alliance, ULA were flat versus prior year. The picture to the right is of the eighth GPS III satellite that successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida in May and achieved signal acquisition. In addition, the Space Force ordered two additional GPS IIIF satellites in the quarter. Now I'll turn it back over to Evan. Thanks, Maria. Shifting gears, I'll walk through guidance on chart nine.\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWe've updated our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2025 financial outlook to incorporate the impact of several items, including the aforementioned charges this quarter, our current estimation of the tariff impacts, and anticipated tax benefits from the recently passed legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. With a solid year-to-date growth and expectations for continued ramps in the second half of the year, we are reaffirming our sales guidance of $73.75 billion to 74.75 billion. On a related note, we have line of sight to increase backlog in 2025 with a handful of significant awards expected in the second half of the year, including F-35 Lot 18 19, JASSM-LRASM Large Lot Procurement, PAC-3 Production, CH-53K Multiyear, and Classified Space providing a solid foundation for sustained future growth.\nSegment operating profit is now expected to be in the range of $6.6 to 6.7 billion, with an implied midpoint margin of 9%, reflecting the $1.6 billion of program charges. We've lowered our earnings per share estimate to a range of $21.70 to 22, incorporating the impacts from the charges, impairments, and tax reserve. Turning to cash flow, we are maintaining our previously provided range of $6.6 to 6.8 billion for free cash flow in 2025. There are a few offsetting items worth discussing. First, the aeronautics classified program challenges negatively impact cash flow and that, along with the tariff impacts, combine to approximately $500 million of headwind this year. On the other hand, the administration's legislation is anticipated to provide approximately $400 to 600 million in cash tax benefits, primarily related to R&D capitalization. The 2025 outlook does not include a pension contribution.\nBefore wrapping it up, I'd like to take a moment to look beyond 2025 for free cash flow specifically. Previously, we discussed a baseline case of low single-digit absolute free cash flow growth through 2027, with an upside case of mid-single-digit growth being possible if we could unlock working capital improvements and offset the multi-year pension headwinds. This quarter's events and the rapidly developing opportunities are driving investment demands in the form of advancing these complex programs, accelerating capacity, and enhancing capability across our systems. As a result, our 2026 free cash flow could be closer to $6 billion. That said, we remain confident in Lockheed Martin's prospects for growth and value creation and remain committed to returning at least $6 billion per year to shareholders through our reliable dividend and share repurchase program.\nIn summary, on chart ten, we're excited about what the future has to offer, and we look forward to making progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, including continuing to execute on our strong backlog of $167 billion. I will be partnering with Jim, Frank, and the rest of the leadership team to ensure we continue to drive operational excellence, ensuring we deliver on our customer and programmatic commitments while also generating solid financial returns that create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, Sarah, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star then one on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an annunciator indicating you have been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star then one again. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star then one. Your first question comes from Myles Walton of (Wolfe Research). Your line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Jim and Evan, I'm not sure who wants to take it first, but why should investors feel at all comfortable that you've de-risked the problem programs, particularly the Arrow classified one? When I listen to the changes being made on process and increased attention, it sounds similar to Q4. So I'm just trying to reconcile what are you doing different? Number one, why should we feel comforted that this is de-risked? And then second or thirdly, can you just give us some color clarity as to how long you're under this onerous contract?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Myles. It's Jim here. I'll start off and offer it to Evan for more detail. So with Evan's succession as the CFO role earlier this year, and evidence of further program performance issues beginning to re-emerge early in 2025, we reconstituted the program review team for classified aeronautics programs. So we had a different team, wider expertise from across the company, and a higher-level management as part of the scrutiny of the program. So once we put that team together, having added additional expertise, as I said, from across the company, we reassessed the newly evident trends of cost increases and reevaluated all the program assumptions to the most detailed level of depth, a level below what had been done previously.\nOnce these assumptions, and they were long-standing assumptions, were re-baselined to the then current performance, the additional reach-forward loss was calculated based on numerous future years of fixed-price contract commitments. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the classification, we can't say how many years that is, but I'll say it is not unlimited. As to the two long-troubled programs at Sikorsky, new in-depth discussions were held with each of the two customers in H1 2025 as to the future course of the contracts, as you heard.\nThis feedback, along with the internal program reviews of both, again, led by Evan in his new role, resulted in the charges that we're reporting in those two programs. So I assure you that going forward, these three programs will continue to be monitored with a similar oversight regime, including recurring senior management participation, a more robust sequence and tempo of the senior management reviews than ever before.\nWe expect to be able to continue to reduce risk and promptly identify emerging issues and corrective actions if and when they're needed. We'll also be applying this level of oversight and scrutiny to key programs across the company. In addition, given the critical importance and customer support for these three particular programs, we will be, and I will be actually, further engaging their respective customers on opportunities to restructure these program contracts to moderate the currently identified and other potential risks while meeting the national security objectives of those customers. Finally, I want to reiterate the policy that was put in place at Lockheed Martin five years ago, that there are no longer any must-win programs. We will continue to ensure that every bid-price proposal and contract structure does not introduce outsized or unbounded future risk as we're seeing on these three programs. Evan, you want to add anything to that?\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. I fully agree with that approach and have taken on what you've asked me to look on here. I would just add as well that the additional controls and rhythms that we established after Q4 gave us better insight into the challenges as they emerged. So that's a commitment to continue transparency. And that's what allowed us to signal in May that we were experiencing cost challenges and to have better insight as the continued program moved forward. Note that at that same time, we signaled cost confidence in the MFC classified program in that we have the same established discipline there.\nSo we took the right amount of time to go through every assumption that we've got the best possible estimate to complete the multi-year process ahead of us. So I'll commit we'll continue to be transparent as we perform on these programs, actively monitoring, managing those risks, and think of every quarter as a burn down of risk as we work through the development tasks on these game-changing products. And we will keep you all updated as we go.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, yeah. Good afternoon, morning, guys. So kind of two things here. Just a quick follow-on to Myles' question because I don't think you answered it. Why did it take a billion dollars of charges to change the way you're reviewing this thing? That's to Jim. And then to Evan, maybe kind of more from an accounting perspective. The $1.8 billion of charges, how do we think that flows through to cash? Can you do the bridge for 2025? Then maybe the bridge into 2026, right? Because there's some of this that's probably not all $1.8 billion and got a cash impact. How much does and how should we think about that?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. Hey, Ron. So as Evan sort of stated, in the Q4 review for 2024 financials, when we took the first charge, we actually reset the entire way that that program is monitored, I'll say. And in that more rigorous monitoring system, we started to see, as Evan had signaled publicly in May, as he said, additional cost risks. There was an anomaly, as we call it, in the development phase that was going to add cost and time as well. So these are new discoveries that resulted in the charge that we're taking today.\nWe didn't recognize or know that these trends were happening until the year began. We started with that new monitoring system from Q4, seeing the cost rise, which we signaled. Then we have to flow it through to, again, multiple years of fixed-price obligations to the government that were agreed to in 2018. That's why you see the magnitude. Now, will there be opportunity to reduce that? We hope so. Part of it is potential contract restructuring. The customer is aware of, and will become increasingly aware after today, of the cost that this program is putting on the company. I think they're open to figuring out ways to make it more reasonable, as I said, while keeping the national security commitments that are required. That's the explanation. Like I said, we take it very seriously. It was disconcerting to us when we started to see the cost growth after we'd done the review previously.\nBut that's the nature of something of this magical status, I would call it. We probably won't be able to talk about what that is for many years to come, but I can assure you that it's going to be in high demand for a very long time, well beyond the fixed-price commitments I would expect, let's say. So I'll stop there. Evan, anything else?\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYes. So Ron, just to address the cash specifically. So we previously had assumed some cash usage on this program in our prior cash flow guidance. As of today, we're assuming a usage of $500 million of cash tied to the Arrow classified program this year, which is baked inside of our cash guidance that we're reiterating at 6.6 to 6.8.\nLooking into next year, it steps down a little bit. Think of roughly $400-ish million of cash usage next year, which we've factored in by giving the cash flow guidance for next year. And then it continues to step down. We have line of sight to when it goes positive. And to Jim's point, I can't state exactly when that is, but it's within our line of sight.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\nGood morning. [crosstalk]\nMorning. [crosstalk]\nMorning. [crosstalk]\nJim, a quick question for you on the F-35. The administration's FY26 request for the DOD shows a reduction in what they want from the aircraft. And I was wondering if you've got any explanation as to why the customer is saying this. And then secondly, how easy is it to actually swap out any relinquished DOD slots, if that occurs, with export customers? Thank you.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Rob, you're absolutely right about the president's budget, which is the first step in the actual congressional process of creating orders and allocating appropriations to those orders. And so where we're at in the process now is that the House Appropriations Committee marked up the 47 to 69. So the House added in appropriations, actually, right? So 22 jets, that's the last step in their process. The Senate's not as far along. The Senate Armed Services Committee has marked it up to 57, so that's an increase of 10. Historically, the appropriations committees have the final say on numbers. So we don't know what the House's position is on that. We don't know yet the Senate's. But I would be hopeful, and we certainly can't guarantee this outcome, but I'd be hopeful that the House Appropriations Committee mark might flow over to the Senate, but that's a hopeful future.\nWe can't guarantee that. So there will be, I think, greater demand by the end of the budget process than what was submitted initially in the president's budget.\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAnd I'll add as well, despite just a lot of F-35s being delivered, as Jim mentioned, we delivered 50 this quarter and continue to deliver strong. We still have 311 in backlog as we end Q2, and we expect to add about another 150 with Lot 19 coming up the second half of the year. So in terms of looking ahead and being able to plan for production plans, we've got a fair bit of flexibility based on the strength of our backlog today.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. That's right. Because we've got a couple-year lead times, we can move international in and out. And as you heard, there are plus-ups in a number of current customers, and there's interest in others, which, of course, I can't get into at this point, but it can be very exciting. So we'll have to play all that out, but I'm confident that the F-35 production rate will stay strong.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with (Jefferies). Your line is open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Good morning, Jim and Evan. Maybe if we could talk, and Maria, maybe if we could talk about two items because I'm a bit confused. First, if we could touch upon the $4.6 billion tax liability commentary. What's that related to, and how would it impact free cash flow going forward? And Evan, on the $6 billion free cash flow target for 2026, down 10% versus 2025, how much of that is any forward losses, working capital investment? What's the benefit from Section 174? If you could clarify in any pension contribution assumed in that number. Thank you.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSheila, I appreciate the question. So with respect to the tax NOFA that we received from the IRS, we have filed our appeal as we fundamentally disagree with the position that the IRS has taken. As we stated in the comments, they had previously signed off and agreed with our interpretation. As our process appropriately matches revenue and expenses, the IRS's approach shows a mismatch between the two, which is why you see such a large number.\nWe stand by our approach, and we have taken a $100 million P&L charge to reference some amount of interest just to have some amount of liability in the books that we think is the most likely outcome if this should see itself all the way through, which is to say much, much less than the numbers that we're talking about here. With respect to looking forward to next year, a couple of things there to look at. One is, on the Arrow classified program, we see that a few hundred million dollars of reach forward charge cash impact. On the MFC classified program, there's roughly 200 to 250-ish also in that 2026 cash flow expectation. We see some goodness on the tax side from the new tax legislation of a few hundred million dollars.\nAnd then we continue to work working capital in the meantime to continue to drive that. Those are sort of the main items right now that are assumed in there, as well as some kind of nominal tariff timing impact as well, all sort of baked into our latest assumption. And I should add that we also have assumed a $1 billion pension contribution next year, and this year there is no pension contribution.\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. And Sheila, just to add something from my perspective at the most basic level on this tax claim, it's basically a value-added tax approach, which we don't have in this country, where we get taxed on our revenue versus taxed on our profit. So I am incredibly confident that this will get adjudicated fairly and the reserve is appropriate for this point in time.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Noah Poponak with (Goldman Sachs). Your line is open.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Evan, the updated 2025 guidance implies that in the back half, the RMS margin is in the mid-10s, Aeronautics in the mid-9s, and I think the total in the mid-10s. Are those the run rates of those segment margins for the foreseeable future with the adjustments you've taken today, or is there some reason those would step up next year? And then can you just talk a little bit more about your review of the MFC classified program that's had charges before? Because that had a little bit of an unusual treatment where there were planned charges in the future.\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. Good morning. So I think with respect to margins, as we look at it here, we did see some one-time step-ups in the first half of the year. So we're going to continue to look at out-year margins as we go through the LRP process, and we'll have more to say in the coming quarters. The goal, of course, is to continue to drive margins up incrementally as we see mix turn to more established production programs in that we're ramping across several of those. So we'll share more of that in the coming quarters as we work through that process. With respect to MFC classified program, this is a program I'm very familiar with in that I worked it personally in my last role. So it also has a reach forward charge that we disclosed in the Q4 of last year. We've continued to monitor this very closely, similar to how we're monitoring the Arrow classified program.\nWe've signaled throughout this quarter and continue to signal now that we've got confidence with how we're positioned with that program. Also, a very important program for the warfighter that we're anxious to deliver with strong customer advocacy. Jim, anything you'd add?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. I'd say the MFC program, and I mentioned this before, as an ex-Air Force pilot, this is another game-changing capability for the US, really essential. And even on the margins, I think there is some upside in the future because those margins were affected by some of these one-time write-offs, although there were some plus-ups. The write-offs obviously were way higher. So there could be upside. We're not doing guidance for 2026 here, but there could be opportunity, especially in MFC.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Arment with (Baird) Your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jim and Evan.\nJim, and Evan, you both commented on backlog and expected some growth in the back half of the year. Maybe could you comment on Golden Dome specifically? Have you quantified the opportunity for Lockheed Martin, and when we would expect it to hit from a backlog perspective, just thinking in terms of the size? And then just quickly, Evan, as we think about cash and with TR3 completed, should we expect to see an improvement in kind of the milestone payments for F-35? Thanks.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOn Golden Dome, the plan on the government side isn't laid out yet. As I mentioned earlier, I think we have many, many of the essential ingredients to implement something of that nature, especially at the scale that's being discussed. The other part I would love to talk about, but we're a little short on time, so I'll do it another day, is counter-UAS will be part of that, and we're making lots of advancements there. We don't usually come out and tout things until they're up and running and we have a customer and we're delivering. But that's an initiative that will be part of Golden Dome that we're getting out in front of counter-UAS. And so I would love to be able to say that we have a quantifiable uptick to backlog because of Golden Dome but there's no contracts out there. There's no bid and proposals yet. And so as soon as we have them we're going to be all in on those.\nAnd we are talking about architecture with the US government as to how you might architect and lay something like this out over time, but they haven't announced anything yet that we can actually hang our hat on for backlog. Yeah.\n\nEvan Scott\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAnd to add on to that, just maybe one or two thoughts on Golden Dome. So yeah, even without that, we see the backlog really driving up to the second half of the year. I expect to end the year with a new backlog record with just very strong orders to come. And I'll just note as well, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, it helps incentivize investment in US manufacturing because seeing where the demand is going to come for Golden Dome, we see our missile programs being very key to that, and we're getting ourselves ready to invest in additional manufacturing capacity.\nThe timing is very good with the tax act that came through. With respect to cash, absolutely. We expect to see a very strong cash second half of the year led by F-35. Getting the Lot 18 and 19 award under contract will be a significant cash liquidation event. That with some other awards across the portfolio should give us a very strong lift on working capital.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kristine Liwag with (Morgan Stanley). Your line is open.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Hey, good morning, Jim and Evan. Maybe the F-35, Jim, you touched on the F-35's role on the Operation Midnight Hammer, and you prepared your marks. We've already discussed the uncertainty in the current funding, especially with Lot 18 and 19. Taking a step back, we've seen the DOD cut F-35 units in the past few years. This has been the largest procurement program for the DOD and is generally viewed as a potential bill payer for other priorities. The B-21, on the other hand, is getting accelerated and increased funding. Can you level set us on the F-35 as a program today? Where does it fit in modern warfare, and how do you see orders materializing for international customers? And ultimately, how much of a priority is this for the DOD today?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo without getting into anything classified, the F-35 right now, and you've heard about one mission that's been accomplished in Iran that was led by the F-22 and the F-35. There have been others as well that those aircraft have been heavily involved in. And not only just air-to-air and air-to-ground attack, but also in the orchestration of numerous other platforms, whether they be sea, satellite, other aircraft, fourth-gen, etc., that this airplane can deliver. Some of the, I'll call it NATO air policing missions have benefited from the F-35 in this regard and others. So knowing what I can know, I am very, very confident the F-35 is here to stay and here to stay in a big way for a long time. It's the only fifth-generation fighter aircraft in production right now in the free world, fighter aircraft, I should say. And it's proved itself in combat. So we will continue with our allies and with our US customer to be delivering these aircraft. I am very, very confident, especially with my background and what we know about what's happening today.\nAnd I'll add one other thing because we did bid on NGAD. Everyone knows that. We weren't selected. But the pivot that we made is one that we're taking incredibly seriously, which is how do we create a best value bridge from today's fifth-generation to sixth-generation NGAD, as next-generation air dominance airplane? And that may not be fielded for quite a few years, I'll say, a number of years. How do we bridge capability there? We're going to port a lot of our own NGAD R&D over to the F-35 and potentially the F-22 as well, and striving to get 80% effectiveness of sixth-generation, both in stealth and other aspects at 50% of the cost per unit, all in with R&D and non-recurring. And that's a best value option for the US government going forward. It'll be the only one I'm aware of that can actually make that bridge over, call it five plus, maybe even ten years.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Mikus with (Melius Research). Your line is open.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector of Melius Research, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, Jim. On the F-35 delivery timeline and the outlook, in order to protect that program and prevent it from being, say, crowded out by the F-47, CCA, or nuclear modernization, does it make sense to sell the DOD the technical data rights to the F-35 as part of a broader deal to ensure the DOD buys a minimum amount of units per year to sustain the production rate of 156?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nI'm not sure that's necessary for two reasons, Scott. One is we've already provided the US government all the data that they need that we control to maintain the aircraft and all of its systems.\nSome of our suppliers have opted not to participate in that approach that we've taken, but we don't control or own their data. And so everything Lockheed Martin can provide to the services and the government to maintain their aircraft fleet, we have provided. So that's one side of the story. And then the second is that the demand for the aircraft is still going to be there. As I said, fourth-generation aircraft are retiring. They're also incredibly unsurvivable in the current scenario. A fourth-generation aircraft couldn't have accomplished that mission that we talked about on Midnight Hammer. So I think the base demand is there. The intellectual property is already being provided to the extent we have the ability to do that. But it's an excellent question. I think we're in a good place on both fronts. All right.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nGreat. Sarah, well, we're approaching the top of the hour. So I think that's it for Q&A. Jim did have some closing comments, so let me hand it back to Jim.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content2": "All right. Thanks, Maria. Look, all of us at Lockheed Martin fully understand that it's our responsibility to negotiate fair, risk-informed contracts and to deliver on those contract commitments in terms of cost, quality, and schedule every day. Only in this can we both contribute fully to our national defense and deterrence from our conflict and deliver strong financial results to the shareholders. Doing both is and will be our purpose. While the charges that we've taken in Q2 have been difficult and have affected our 2025 outlook, we will now be better positioned to fully deliver on our profitable growth prospects going forward. I'm confident in the many strengths that position this company for long-term success.\nOur growth pipeline is strong, as you heard from Evan earlier today. Our customers are heavily reliant on us to deliver proven critical capabilities. And maybe most importantly, all of our 120,000 Lockheed Martin teammates are committed to delivering results for us. I and our management team are focused on continuing to translate the strong customer demand and our unique capabilities to deliver top-line growth, get that consistent cash flow generation, and shareholder value creation as a result. So I look forward to connecting again in October on our Q3 Earnings Call. So thank you, everybody, and Sarah that concludes our call for today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q4 and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. As you saw in the press release this morning, our return to growth strategy that we implemented three years ago is well on its way and remains on a strong trajectory. In 2024, sales grew 5% year-over-year, and our backlog of $176 billion reached yet another record, demonstrating the enduring global demand for our superior, scalable, and reliable products and systems. Each and every one of our four business areas saw backlog growth and ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of greater than one. We fully expect these positive trends to continue in our 2025 outlook, with mid-single-digit growth in sales, segment operating profit returning to 11%, and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share.\nJay and Maria will cover the financials in more detail, but I'd like to briefly comment on the earnings impact in the Q4 of two classified programs at MFC and Aeronautics, respectively. Recording charges in Q4 on these two programs enabled us to de-risk the financial profile of both these critical national security programs going forward as we move into their next phases. While these particular contracts were struck a number of years ago, there are no longer any must-win competitions. Under today's Lockheed Martin-wide bid process, every proposal adheres to a stringent, risk-adjusted ROI regime. This process is designed to compete aggressively for key opportunities while also being very committed to achieving positive results both in the short and long term for our shareholders.\nAt the same time, we are committed to ongoing investment in the business to further enhance our company's growth trajectory, having successfully executed our return to growth initiative over the past few years. In 2024, we invested $3.3 billion in research and development and capital to support advanced, scalable technology solutions for our customers. Equally important, looking forward, our investments to enhance the attractiveness and performance of our key programs and initiatives, such as America's preeminent fifth-generation fighter, the F-35, and our internal digital transformation, 1LMX, are expected to grow. Our financial focus remains on free cash flow and free cash flow per share. Our company continued to deploy significant free cash flow in 2024, and we've returned greater than 100% of that free cash flow to you, the shareholders.\nIn addition to our consistent and healthy dividend, we maintain a robust share repurchase program, with $3.7 billion of shares purchased in 2024. Turning to the F-35, we delivered 62 aircraft in the quarter, bringing our total deliveries for 2024 to 110, the high end of our expected range. These deliveries included aircraft that were previously parked and new jets that rolled off the production line. We continue to expect deliveries will exceed the production rate over the next few years and estimate 170 to 190 F-35 aircraft deliveries in 2025. TR-3 capabilities continue to progress in flight testing. We completed qualification testing on a set of key TR-3 capabilities in 2024, and we're making solid progress on system performance and remaining TR-3 deliverables. We expect to release additional capability this year, with further upgrades to follow.\nIn addition, the undefinitized contract for Lot 18 F-35 production was awarded in December, bringing our backlog to 408 aircraft. We expect this contract will be definitized during H1 2025. We welcomed our 20th global customer, Romania, into the F-35 enterprise in November with its letter of offer and acceptance to procure 32 aircraft. The Romanian Air Force's F-35s will integrate with their existing F-16 fleets, as well as other allied F-35s, highlighting the importance of the superior capabilities of this aircraft.\nMoreover, the F-35's seamless interoperability using our 5G.mil architecture will be crucial in establishing and maintaining command of the air, especially in the Indo-Pacific, European, and Middle Eastern theaters. Lockheed Martin's system of integration expertise across land, air, sea, space, and cyber are essential to continually improving many important national security missions, such as protection from air and missile attacks.\nIn this example, our defensive Guam flight experimentation mission in December successfully demonstrated the integration of multiple Lockheed Martin and other OEM products into a single combined weapon system. Our Aegis Guam System was successful in acquiring and tracking targets using our TPY-6 Radar, planning and conducting the missile engagement using our Aegis Combat System. Then we fired the interceptor from one of our vertical launching systems and ultimately destroyed the incoming weapon.\nEqually important was the accelerated pace from contract award to successful completion of this flight test mission in under two years, and was a direct result of leveraging prior investments in all these proven technologies. Building on our production-ready air-launched rapid response weapon, or ARRW, America's hypersonics technology made another important milestone in the development of one of our most important and advanced weapon systems in December. The U.S. Army and U.S.\nNavy completed a successful end-to-end flight test of the common hypersonic all-up round, the first live-fire event for the long-range hypersonic weapons system. I'd like to shift gears now to current discourse about the defense industry landscape. Much has been said about defense primes, emerging startups, traditional and non-traditional companies. I see us all working together, and I think that it's industry's role to help marshal the talent and expertise in our country to provide the best possible deterrent capabilities with both physical products such as ships, aircraft, and satellites, as well as digital advanced technologies. We need to access the best talent, financial resources, and technologies from both the aerospace and defense, and commercial sectors to get ahead and stay ahead.\nTo that end, on the commercial front, I've long been an advocate of deepening partnerships across industries, and we have done so with companies such as NVIDIA for artificial intelligence, Meta and IBM for large language models to more efficiently generate code, analyze data, and enhance business processes, Verizon for 5G networks, Microsoft for classified cloud modeling and simulation, and Intel and GlobalFoundries for advanced military hardened chips. We're also investing heavily on internal development, autonomy, AI, and other enabling digital technologies to provide the best solutions for our customers. Skunk Works continues to drive the cutting edge, theater-level security solutions.\nIn real-time live-flight demonstrations, we had an F-35 flying from our facility in North Fort Worth, Texas, sharing classified data via a Skunk Works open system gateway through a commercial satellite communications and all the way over into a Royal Air Force lab in Farnborough, UK, where it was integrated into their command and control system. This achievement marks a significant step toward a future integrated defense, enhancing our F-35 interoperability in real time with an allied C2 system using our 5G.mil architecture.\nIn another first, our Lockheed Martin Skunk Works team, along with the US Navy and General Atomics, completed a live-controlled flight demonstration of an uncrewed system by the uncrewed command carrier aviation mission control station, which was powered by our autonomy platform. This demonstration is a pathfinder that helps advance the complex technology necessary to enable human-machine teaming, as envisioned for autonomous systems.\nWe're doing it right now. Turning to the budget, the current continuing resolution funds US government operations through March. We look forward to working with the returning administration to continue pursuing a more agile and streamlined acquisition process that encourages speed, technology innovation, and broader participation. We see DOGE as an opportunity to make great progress in all these areas, and we will continue to share ideas and do our part to support efforts to eliminate unnecessary regulatory hurdles while working to increase efficiency in our own internal operations through our 1LMX digital transformation. Now I'll turn it over to Jay.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financial results for the Q4 and full year, then hand off to Maria, who will cover business area financials, and I'll come back at the end to discuss our initial 2025 outlook. 2024 was a solid year. Our growth strategies are paying off with 5% top-line growth, while also growing backlog 10% to $176 billion, another year-end record. Our balanced portfolio enabled us to generate solid free cash flow and meet our deployment commitments exceeding 100%. Finally, we took prudent de-risking actions on key programs that paved the way for a solid outlook in 2025 and beyond. Before I get into the results in more detail, I'll walk you through these de-risking actions.\nChart 4 provides two different reconciliations that detail the full impact of these items on our full-year results and their partial impact to our prior expectations. We've also included a Q4 version of the same chart in the appendix and slide 20. For purposes of understanding the total impact on our full-year results, I'll direct your attention to the middle section of the chart.\nWe recorded net charges of $1.8 billion as follows: $1.4 billion related to the remaining expected future losses on the MFC classified program, and $555 million associated with the Aeronautics classified program, with these amounts partially offset by a $155 million benefit associated with our C-5 claim resolution. Moving over to the right side of the chart, you may recall that our last outlook in October had assumed some of these net charges, so let me walk you through that as well.\nRelative to our prior outlook, we recorded $1.4 billion of unplanned net charges, consisting of $410 million for the Aeronautics classified program, $1.1 billion from the MFC classified program, with these amounts partially offset by $70 million of unplanned benefit from the C-5 claim resolution. Both reconciliations provide adjusted results to exclude the impact of these items for comparison purposes. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will refer to the reported and adjusted amounts as shown on the left side of the chart, unless otherwise noted. Okay, moving to chart 5 with Q4 results. Sales of $18.6 billion were down slightly year-over-year. Sales in the quarter were unfavorably impacted by having one fewer week in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 of 2023, partially offset by the F-35 Lot 18 deferred revenue carryover from the Q3.\nSegment operating profits, segment margins, and earnings per share were all adversely impacted by the classified program charges at Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control. On an adjusted basis, segment operating profit would have grown 5% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, resulting in segment margins of 11.1%. Shifting to new business, we recorded over $29 billion of orders in the Q4 for a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.6. Aeronautics led the way with almost $20 billion in orders driven by the F-35 Lot 18 and F-35 Air Vehicle Sustainment Contract awards. Both contracts will help secure the wide-reaching F-35 U.S. production enterprise and ensure America's military is equipped with the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world. Free cash flow was $440 million in the quarter, including $990 million of pension pre-funding to extinguish the 2025 required contributions.\nContinuing with capital deployment, we further advanced strategic, technical, and operational capabilities by investing over $1.1 billion in the quarter towards independent research and development, and capital expenditure projects, bringing full-year internal investment to $3.3 billion. We continue to provide an unmatched combination of new technology advancement that can be also fielded with speed.\nSo, investing to deliver critical capabilities while maintaining our commitment to shareholders by returning $1.8 billion of free cash flow via share repurchases and dividends. Turning to Chart 6 and our full-year 2024 results, sales of $71 billion grew 5%, driven by improved backlog conversion, reflecting stronger throughput across the entire value chain. Similar to Q4, segment operating profits, segment margins, and earnings per share were impacted by the net program charges on slide 4. On an adjusted basis, segment operating profit grew 7% year-over-year, and adjusted segment margins were 11.1%.\nBook-to-bill for the year was greater than 1, and the third consecutive year we've increased backlog. We generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, including the pension pre-funding. Finally, our consistent capital deployment continued in 2024 as we returned $6.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Now I'll turn it over to Maria to discuss business area results.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP and Treasurer of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jay. Today, I'll discuss Q4 and full-year results for the business areas. As Jay mentioned, you'll notice that we've included both reported GAAP and adjusted results for each business area in order to provide meaningful comparisons and a more realistic expectation of recurring operational performance. Starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7, Q4 sales at Aero increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher F-35 volume on production and sustainment contracts due to contract awards in the quarter, including the awards for the Lot 18 undefinitized contract action and air vehicle sustainment contract. Partially offsetting this was lower volume at Skunk Works, driven by the unfavorable sales impact associated with the classified program charge. Adjusting for the impacts of the classified program charge and the C-5 contract resolution, the adjusted sales growth at Aero was approximately 7% year-over-year in Q4 2024.\nBoth reported and adjusted sales in the Q4 benefited from $700 million of F-35 sales deferred from the Q3. Segment operating profit decreased 43% compared to Q4 2023. Lower profit booking rate adjustments due to the $410 million classified program charge in the quarter were partially offset by higher sales volume, and the benefit related to the C-5 claim resolution.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating profit year-over-year in the quarter increased slightly. For the full year, sales increased 4%, driven by higher volume across the F-35 program, and the production ramp on the F-16 program, partially offset by lower volume at Skunk Works due to the sales impact related to the classified program charge. Full-year segment operating profit decreased 11%, driven by the same items we saw in the Q4. Lower profit rate adjustments partially offset by sales volume, and the C-5 claim resolution benefit.\nOn an adjusted basis, Aeronautics' full-year operating profit grew by 3%, equating to 10.2% margin for the year. Turning to Missiles and Fire Control on Chart 8, MFC sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by production ramps on joint air-to-surface standoff missile, JASSM, long-range anti-ship missile, LRASM, guided multiple launch rocket system, GMLRS, and PAC-3. Normalizing for the extra week in the Q4 of 2023, MFC sales grew 16% year-over-year. Segment operating profit decreased significantly year-over-year in the quarter due to lower profit booking rate adjustments driven by the recognition of reach-forward losses on the classified program. Adjusting for that item, segment margins were a strong 14.8% in the quarter. For the full year, MFC sales increased double digits, up 13%, again due to production ramps on GMLRS, LRASM, JASSM, and PAC-3 programs.\nFull-year segment operating profit declined $1.1 billion year-over-year due to $1.4 billion of classified program charges, which were partially offset by higher volume from the production ramps. Excluding the classified program charges, MFC's segment operating margin for the full year was a solid 14.4%. Shifting to rotary and mission systems on Chart 9, sales decreased 10% in the quarter to approximately $4.3 billion, primarily driven by lower volume on Seahawks, CRH, Aegis, and various C6ISR programs. Normalizing for the week difference in Q4 2023, RMS sales were down 3% year-over-year in the quarter. Similar to sales, operating profit was down 11% year-over-year due to lower profit booking rate adjustments in sales volume, partially offset by favorable contract mix.\nFor the full year, sales increased 6% at RMS, primarily driven by higher volume on the Canadian Surface Combatant and laser programs within the Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors business, as well as various C6ISR programs and the CH-53K ramp at Sikorsky. Operating profit was up 3% for the year due to the higher sales volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments.\nFinally, with Space on Chart 10, sales decreased 13% year-over-year in the Q4. The reduction was driven by lower volume on Next Gen OPIR, Orion, and classified, primarily due to program life cycles. Normalized for the number of weeks in the quarter year-over-year, sales were down 6%. Operating profit decreased 8% compared to Q4 2023, driven by lower volume and lower profit booking rate adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from the United Launch Alliance.\nTurning to the full year, sales decreased slightly, driven by lower volume on the same programs as in the Q4, partially offset by higher volume on the Fleet Ballistic Missile and Reentry program. Meanwhile, operating profit increased 6% in 2024 due to favorable contract mix and higher ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. I'd like to note the photo on page 10. In December, Lockheed Martin supported the successful launch of the GPS-3 space vehicle 7, which we designed and built. This accelerated launch required complex integration and was the first to demonstrate operational agility for critical national security missions. With that, I will turn it back over to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAll right, thanks, Maria. Turning to Chart 11 and our forward expectations. Our outlook for 2025 has improved since October, along with our rising value chain performance expectations, in addition to the benefit from the de-risking actions we took in 2024. We anticipate sales growth of 4-5% on top of the 5% we delivered in 2024. We expect MFC to again lead the way with 8% growth at the midpoint as we continue to ramp production across several programs to support the strong demand for our combat-proven munitions and integrated air and missile defense systems. As previously discussed, operating margins returned to 11%, and free cash flow grows 9% at the midpoint from 2024 adjusted results, setting up double-digit growth in free cash flow per share in spite of non-cash FAS pension headwind lowering EPS.\nI'll step through segment operating profit and EPS bridges in more detail in the following charts. Chart 12 bridges the 2024 reported segment operating profit of $6.1 billion to the 2025 guidance midpoint of $8.15 billion. After accounting for the 2024 net charges, we expect operating profit growth from the adjusted 2024 position. The growth is primarily due to the volume drop-through and partially offset by other items, mainly lower expected net profit rate adjustments. Importantly, segment margins are expected to return to 11% in 2025 earlier than planned. Next, on Chart 13, we have a similar walk for earnings per share. Here, we expect EPS to decline slightly from the 2024 adjusted position, mainly due to non-operational items, notably the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, as well as higher interest expense.\nBringing it all together, we expect solid sales growth in 2025 off the higher 2024 base, operating margins at the 11% target, and solid cash flow generation that enables consistent shareholder returns. So, in summary, on Chart 14, in 2024, we delivered stronger top-line growth than initially expected, reflecting an improving operating cadence. We also expanded our backlog to a new record, demonstrating the strength of our unmatched capability to deliver security solutions at speed while increasing investment to expand this capability.\nAnd we prudently de-risked programs, all the while dependably generating free cash flow and deploying it as committed. Taken together, these actions give us confidence to deliver a strong financial outlook for 2025. At the same time, we will continue to propel this industry forward with innovative solutions that integrate the best that commercial and military industries can offer.\nOf course, we remain focused on operational execution to deliver on our commitments and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. With that, Sarah, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press Star, then 1 now on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an annunciator indicating that you have been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star, then 1 again. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press Star 1 at this time. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman. Seifman, my apologies, from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nNo worries. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nMorning. I wanted to ask, Jay, you emphasized kind of the de-risking nature of the charges in Q4. I know maybe it's difficult to discuss because it's classified, but within Aeronautics, all of the filing language has sort of emphasized continued risk there. Should we think that within following this charge, the potential for future charges there has really come down considerably? And is there anything you can say about where we might be in the life cycle of that program and when it might be able to provide some positive returns? And then thinking maybe that the answer there might have to be a little bit circumspect, if you could just comment on the multi-year targets that you gave on the last call and how to think about those now.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Thanks, Seth. There's about 16 questions in that one question, but I'll take a shot at all of them. Just as far as the risk, I would say we significantly reduced the risk. I can't really get into the life cycle of the program given the classified nature of it, but let me walk you through why I believe that we've significantly reduced the risk. As you know, we had realized this risk earlier in the year, causing us to perform a more comprehensive review of current performance versus our key assumptions included in the estimate to complete. We evaluated the risk and opportunities and made the determination that a cost reset was warranted. The amount that we recorded in the quarter is the most conservative assessment we've made to date. We've also made a number of process changes.\nAeronautics, along with our corporate staff, have implemented a more continuous monitoring process of the progress of this program in terms of technical milestones and added technical resources from outside the program. This will enable both teams to work together to institute support measures as needed faster than before. We've also added technical resources and experts with experience in the risk areas to help bolster the team and mitigate risk as they arise. We've added automated testing procedures as well to accelerate test results and issue resolution should they occur. So all those things taken together give us confidence that we have significantly de-risked this program and significantly reduced the risk of future charges on this. As far as maybe the multi-year outlook, you look at 2025, and certainly the 2025 outlook is better than what we had projected in October.\nIf you recall, we had said our baseline was low single digit with an opportunity to get to a mid-single digit. Here, we believe the opportunity was realized for 2025, which gave us confidence to increase our growth outlook to 4-5%. And that's the same type of process that we'll continue to look at in 2026 and beyond. And again, it's based on our ability to really drive throughput through the entire value chain. As I mentioned before in my prepared remarks, that we continue to have rising expectations there and rising confidence that not only our supply chain, but our internal operations can move at a quicker pace, enabling the unlocking of this revenue growth. So our confidence is growing there.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nQuestion for Jim. At the same time as you're taking these charges on these classified programs, it looks like the new administration and the Department of Defense is actually getting more pro fixed-price contracts and commercial terms. Are you worried that the defense industry could be taking on more risk and opening itself up for more charges in the future?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nNot necessarily, Rob, because we're going to apply this disciplined bid process to fixed-price and cost-plus contracts. If the proportion is moving potentially towards fixed price, we're going to use the same discipline. There's a trend in this industry to be much more deliberate about how each company bids. Each company has its own strategy. Ours is something I brought over from my last business experience, which is risk-adjusted return on investment is the key criteria. Be honest about the risks upfront and price them in. If that price doesn't meet the competition, so be it. We'll move on to other things. I'm not concerned about that. As I said, I look at DOGE as an opportunity because as far back as 2021, I've been advocating for systemic change in the way that the defense enterprise operates.\nAnd that's meaning Congress, executive branch, Pentagon, aerospace and defense industry, commercial tech, and startups. We need to expand our ability as a country to get everybody involved. And I welcome DOGE's effort and the administration's effort to reduce the bureaucracy, limit the administrative burdens that the Pentagon now puts on all companies, big and small, that want to work with it. So again, I look at all this as an opportunity. And if it moves a little bit more towards fixed-price proportions, so be it.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. You know, Rob, the other thing I would say is we've seen, really, to be honest, more over the last probably year to 18 months, more of a contracting regime that's more commensurate with the risk associated with the program. So those that have lower technical maturity, higher risk, the customer has actually been much more receptive and cognizant that those probably are not going to be best delivered under a fixed-price type of contracting regime.\nAnd so you may be hearing words on the one end, but I think there has been a recognition more to make sure that the risk profile is commensurate with the right level of contracting, and that's shared both by the customer and as well as industry. And so there just had been, I think, a different approach. We'll see. We've got to change administration and where that goes forward. I would say there's been a recognition over the last 12 months that fixed-price contracts for immature technology really doesn't help anyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rich Safran of Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nRich Safran\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nThanks. Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. What I'd like to ask is, starting with your 2025 guide for 8% growth, I'd like to know if you could give us maybe a long-term look at MFC in terms of growth and margins and what the potential for the business is. Just kind of wondering, you have the GD Rocket Motor deal and how that factors into your growth and margin outlook, given the volume limitations you've had thus far. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, for MFC, for 2025, it's really more of the same. We continue to see growth on programs like GMLRS, HIMARS, PAC-3, JASSM, and LRASM. And so many of the same growth factors and drivers in 2024 are also the growth drivers in 2025. That demand continues. We have projected orders growth in 2025, things like a multi-year definitization on JASSM and LRASM, which is a pretty sizable multi-year contract. And so the demand cycle there, both domestically and international, was quite strong. And as we've said before, that will be the growth driver for Lockheed Martin for years to come beyond 2025. And so again, when you couple the backlog with the ongoing demand, we feel pretty solid again in these programs. Just there's a solid backstopping of the underlying demand for those.\nOn the margins, we've talked about when you strip out the impact of the classified program, we've talked about 14%. If you look at the midpoint of our guide in that ballpark, we're right around 14%, not necessarily as high as Maria reported on an adjusted basis for 2024, but that's because right now we're expecting some lower net profit adjustments. But their underlying margins are generally in line with what our longer-term expectations are. And that's the way you should think about MFC, around 14%.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, Jay. In the past, you've talked about working capital and specifically the opportunity there to improve the free cash flow. Can you provide a little bit more on what's implied in the 2025 guide for working capital improvement? And has anything structurally changed now as you look at the portfolio in the opportunity, as you've talked about, taking days out and the ability to eventually or continue to drive towards sort of pre-pandemic levels over time?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. You look at. I'll start with maybe 2024. We had a good year in 2024 in spite of some of the headwinds that we faced. We reduced our working capital days by a couple, and we're in the mid-30s as far as cash conversion cycle. For our outlook in 2025, what's implied in there is about one day, which essentially offsets the growth that we're going to see from we would otherwise see in working capital.\nSo what we're trying to do here is just prevent it from being a use of cash and have it be neutral. The opportunity set, obviously, would be to drive beyond one day. And there's still opportunity I talked about before, particularly in our contract assets, our unbilled receivable. There's some opportunity there as we work through on the F-35, both in production as well as sustainment.\nBut there's really opportunities across the portfolio. Sikorsky has a number of opportunities there on their programs, as well as even segments, Space, in MFC. Those are outstanding working capital businesses on a standalone basis. But even so, there's opportunity in the contract assets there. So I would expect in the years to come that we still have opportunity to continue to drive asset productivity there. And that's going to be part of our formula going forward as it was in 2024 and our outlook for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nHey. Thanks. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nCould we just dig in a little further on the free cash flow bridges? The EBIT and EPS bridges were super helpful in the deck, but just given a lot of moving pieces in cash flow, like the F-35 inventory unwind, pension contribution recovery, Lot 18 cash timing. Maybe I missed that one. But if we could just kind of do a bridge walk on cash flow, that'd be great.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. If you just start from this year, adjusted cash flow at $6.1 billion, so adjusted for the pension contribution in 2024, as we mentioned that we expected anywhere around close to $1 billion of benefit on F-35 with higher deliveries as well as progress on the withholds. We also, though, as you remember, in 2024, got the benefit of significant international advances to the tune of $600 million. So partially offsetting that, it's the net impact of those two things, about $400 million in that ballpark.\nWe do expect a benefit from taxes with lower R&D capitalization as that's coming down. And we expect a little bit of benefit from, I'll call it, cash-based net income. All that taken together takes us from $6.1 billion to the $6.7 billion midpoint. So those are the key drivers of free cash flow for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Deuschle of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. Jay, it looks like you're guiding Aeronautics margins down about 20 basis points year-over-year in 2025 if I add back those unplanned charges to the 2024 base. So can you talk a bit about what drives that underlying margin decline, particularly given that you are on these newer contracts for F-35?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So for F-35, we do have, I'm sorry, for aeronautics in total, right now the outlook for their margins does assume lower net profit adjustments. And that's on, call it, an apples-to-apples basis. So excluding the impact of the $555 million in the C-5 adjustment in 2024, profit adjustments there are declining. There is a mixed benefit, but right now the net profit adjustments offset that, and that's what drives the margins down from 10 to around 10. We also have classified growth, which is just a mixed headwind there. But we've got some benefits from F-16 margins as well. But bottom line, again, it comes back to the net profit adjustments being lower.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Aerospace & Defense/Government Services Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Aerospace & Defense/Government Services Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI guess a couple on F-35. You talked a little bit about the progress toward Tech Refresh 3. What exactly is left to get kind of the final withhold? How big is that? And are you assuming you get that within 2025? And then wondering if you could touch on Lot 19 and kind of how the discussions are going there.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, so on the TR-3 capability, we continue to make excellent progress there. There's a number of things that we still have to complete: subsystem integration work as well as improving system stability overall. We expect that will continue throughout the year. We expect to meet some milestones this year. We're targeting as much as possible this year. But I think for purposes of financial modeling, we would expect this to bleed into 2026.\nUltimately, the declaration of full combat capability is one that is left with our customer. And so we'll be coordinating with them and working with them on that. But what I can tell you is that we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far. And the team is working at a pretty good pace here with our supplier partners on improving the mission system capability and as well as improving overall system stability.\nThe second part of the question was Lot 19. So that has been negotiated really in parallel with the Lot 18 negotiation. Just for clarity, Lot 18 is under undefinitized contract action. So we still have to definitize that under, as Jim mentioned, we expect that to be done in the first half of this year. And then shortly thereafter, in the second half of this year, we would also expect to close out on the Lot 19 contract, which would be in order in a range of about $10 billion.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. I was curious on the charges that were unplanned, Jay. How should we think about the cash effect of those? And obviously, the MFC part of that unplanned, you were just planning in the future. So I'm going to guess there's nothing really to think about there. But on the ARRW side, the $400 million of charges taken in the quarter, is that $400 million headwind being absorbed mostly in 2025? And then as we look to 2026, do you still have the pension funding requirement coming back about $1 billion?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. Just starting with the ARRW classified program, that will be certainly a cash flow drag over the next few years. It's not all borne in 2025, but it's something that we expect over the next two to three years that we will have to liquidate that from a cash perspective. As far as pension in 2026, we talked about ongoing cash contribution requirements.\nThe formula to deal with that is similar to what we saw here and we've been talking about. We had the prior discussion here. One of the questions related to working capital. We're going to continue to see what we can do to drive working capital down, improve our asset productivity to offset as much as possible on the pension. And then, as you know, we've got a very strong balance sheet that gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility. We expect to continue to deal with pension with the options that we have before us.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Good morning. I was wondering, at the MFC program that had the charge, is there an opportunity on that program as you scale it to improve the profitability dramatically? I'm just curious over the option period. I imagine demand is pretty strong for that product. I don't know if the pricing may adjust favorably at some point. If you could speak to that.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAgain, it's a classified program, Gautam. So there's not really all that much. What I can tell you is outside of the fixed pricing related to this next phase, the pricing would be open, and we would expect to return to reasonable-type margins over that period of time outside of where we have the fixed committed pricing. I wouldn't expect it to bounce back to MFC-like margins at that point in time. There still would be kind of ramp-ups that you got to deal with. But certainly, the margin profile will get substantially better.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. We expect this to be a long-lived program based on the technology and the value to the US government.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nNext Air Force pilot, I can assure you this is something they will want.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOpportunities to maybe still grow your backlog. Your backlog's at record levels. It was up 10% for the year. Big drivers in MFC and space. But how are you thinking about the opportunities to grow backlog in 2025 and any international kind of awards that you're kind of pursuing that you would highlight? Thanks.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Peter, it's Jim. I'll just start with some of the public statements of the administration, which is reforming the Pentagon. An opportunity there is more long lead time orders, less fragility in the system. In addition to that, multi-year contracting, which has been so far limited to munitions, makes sense in a lot of other places in the Pentagon budget. So if some of those policy changes get implemented, you might see backlog for a company like ours accelerate due to multi-years and longer lead time pre-orders. Okay?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. The line of sight, we do have a line of sight to growth again in 2025. I wouldn't say that it's 10%, but we certainly have some level of growth that we're expecting in 2025 on the backlog. I talked about the $10 billion order on the F-35 on Lot 19. I talked also earlier about the JASSM-LRASM multi-year. That's in the range that's multiple billions of dollars. There's others. There's the international opportunities as well, Türkiye on the F-16 aircraft. There's just a whole slew of opportunities. We also have the just continued F-35 sustainment contract, which will also be multiple billions of dollars as well. CH-53K, Lot 9 is another one we'll be negotiating this year, which is well above a billion dollars. So there's still an excellent line of sight to continue to grow this backlog.\nBut as you know, we're also focused on making sure that we can accelerate the speed of our throughput and drive that backlog conversion faster.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Your line is open.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Alembic Global\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Alembic Global\n\nJim or Jay, just a follow-up on MFC. As you guys think about what DOD is signaling to you in terms of the peak production volumes on the key munitions in MFC, do you guys need additional supplemental bills to kind of get to those levels and sustain those levels, or do you already have kind of funding line of sight from the Ukraine supplemental and maybe what's in the '25 baseline budget, maybe the '26 baseline? I just wanted to get a sense of budget risk there in terms of what your peak rates are, assuming.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. It's really not dependent on additional supplementals. I mean, a lot of this is a lot of the capacity is going to be committed and/or contracted with our customer. And I'll run through a couple of programs. We had always been under contract to get to 550 on the PAC-3 program in 2025. We initially self-funded the investment associated with getting ourselves to 650 on PAC-3. We recently received a contract award for incremental funding on that related to the facilitation.\nWe are driving towards 14,000 on GMLRS. We've been driving, as Jim has mentioned in the past, to 4,000 on Javelin, 96 on HIMARS. And again, the line of sight to those and the funding that's been allocated to those is quite strong, much of which is under contract already. So we view that as fairly low risk at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nHey, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOn F-35, there's been some noise as the new administration has come in about the F-35. But if I put all of that aside, during the first Trump administration, in each of the budgets, F-35 volumes were cut. There seemed to be a view that we didn't need as many. Congress, of course, added some back. But when you look forward, you're looking at still, I assume, 156 per year production rate for a while. How do you think about the interplay of budget decisions in the US with what has been some very strong export demand? In other words, if we should see some reductions in quantities in the US, are you still very confident you're going to be able to continue with that 156 level?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nDoug, it's Jim. I'll start off and say, yes, I am confident of the 156. I think it will come from strong demand from the US government and from our international partners. One reason for that is basically part of deterrence theory is that you have to have the capability to make the adversary reconsider an adverse action against you. China, based on open-source reporting, has increased production of the J-20, which I don't believe just sort of personally that it's equivalent to F-35, but it is their fifth-generation airplane, to over 100 units a year. We're doing 156. We're ahead of them. I think if there was a dramatic change in even the US order book and production, that might be a signal that would be adverse to maintaining an effective deterrent to them. Similar with munitions, right?\nI mean, everybody's watched a Dirty Harry movie or Clint Eastwood movie. [Everybody] knows that when you run out of ammunition, you're highly, highly vulnerable. And that supports some of the conversation Jay was just having. So my view is that there are some very capable people coming into the administration. They understand deterrent theory. The last thing I think this president and administration would want is to create a period of vulnerability with any of our major adversaries in the next few years. So I feel really confident about F-35 production. And the other thing I'll add is that we can already control out of an F-35 up to eight autonomous drones. We've shown this to the Secretary of the Air Force a few months ago. It's public knowledge.\nThere's some classified things that we're doing in the same arena, if you will, to be able to drive manned-unmanned teaming off the F-35 and the F-22. The reason we're starting with the F-35 is because of TR-3. TR-3 gives the F-35 the three things that you need for an effective node and a 5G Internet of Things system, which is what we're talking about. Those three capabilities are data processing with our core processor. It's about 10x from the prior. It's data storage. We have a larger storage unit and multi-path connection back to the cloud as you define the cloud. Ours is DOD classified. But those are the three technical elements you need to have to be able to drive 5G-level connectivity among nodes in a network like this. That's what we have to build.\nF-35, and we're upgrading F-22 in the same way, will have at least one and often more orders of magnitude capability in those digital arenas than the fourth-generation fighter jets we have. And so the capabilities alone that the F-35 can bring to an integrated fight with drones and manned aircraft is unique.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nDoug, I'll just also add that just maybe one data point here is that the age of the existing fleet is beyond 25 years. And so that is necessitating a recapitalization with the F-35. And so there's a certain reality that is going to require the demand of the F-35 to bring the age of the existing fleet back down.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content2": "And then the last thing I'll say is that there's, based on, again, open-source reporting, the experience of the Israeli Air Force against the Iranian air defense system, which they took out in one night with what they characterize as fifth-generation aircraft, and you can match up what's in their inventory with no losses. That would clear the way for fourth-gen aircraft, drones to come in and devastate that country if the Israelis decided to do so. That's the kind of impact that the high-end platforms have, especially if you can network satellite imagery, autonomous vehicle drone imagery, and a command and control speed that no one else can muster. You can have that kind of lopsided victory. And that's another reason I think that the F-35 is going to demonstrate its value here through the Israeli experience.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ciarmoli\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe Jim or Jay, just give a little bit more color on supply chain. I know the general update had been the demand signals were pointing to mid-single digit. Any changes with that under the new administration? And then just given supply chain and the new administration, should we think about that multi-year kind of framework being now firmly in mid-single digits for both revenue and cash flow?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nIt's a good question. Let me just answer your question kind of supply chain operationally. We have seen improvement. We saw improvement certainly in 2024. And we're at levels where they have approached and in certain cases have exceeded what they were pre-COVID. Having said that, there are still discrete issues that we're dealing with across the portfolio. I think MFC is a good example.\nThey've done an outstanding job of managing a number of supply chain issues, but yet they still are there. And so while we have a solid growth outlook there and a strong growth outlook there, they're still being paced to a certain extent. And that goes across much of the portfolios. Of course, another one, CH-53K, has been hampered. And while we have seen improvement, it's still not to the level where we need to be operating out from a contractual standpoint.\nIf we continue to see, though, what we have seen, then sure, I would feel a lot more confident in a multi-year outlook that is more in this 4% to 5% range like we're guiding for for 2025. I think that we need to just go through a little bit more of the passage of time as we go through midway through this year. We get a better outlook on how 2025 is shaping up and how that informs 2026. We'll be able to give you a clearer view longer term. But at the moment, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. And surely, we've seen it here in 2025, and we're starting to gain confidence, as I mentioned before, that it can continue in 2026.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP and Treasurer of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nSarah, let's take one more question. I think we're approaching the top of the hour. And then after this question, we'll hand off to Jim for closing comments. So one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The last question will come from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey. Yeah. Thanks, guys, for the question. Maybe just kind of like a two-parter. The first part's easy, I think, maybe. When they discuss this Iron Dome over the US, isn't that NGI, the contract that you guys already won? Or am I thinking about that wrong? Because isn't that what NGI is?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRon, Jim here. It would be an integral part of a more comprehensive solution to homeland defense. And what the administration has laid out is a defense of the homeland against a multiple set of attack options for any adversary. One of them is, as you say, intercontinental ballistic missile attack. That is something that the NGI is specifically designed to accomplish. But then there's also hypersonic attack.\nWe have a counter-hypersonic effort in this company, knowing that we're going to need to be able to do that. And by the way, to do it, you're going to need AI, and you're going to need high-speed data transmissions, and you're going to have to have multi-sensors and multi-domains to do it. So that's the second one. A third one is cruise missiles, right? We've shown that, for example, we can shoot down cruise missiles with lasers now.\nThat could be part of the solution. Then maybe the lowest level adversary would be a cheap in-country UAV attack, a drone attack on a public place or an air force base or some other US-located facility or asset. That's another set of technologies, which is counter-UAS. We haven't heard back from this administration yet on this topic, but we offered the prior administration at the SecDef level to organize a national team on counter-UAS because I think we have some pretty good technologies. We want to add a lot more from some mid and large companies that do have the relevant technologies as well. So I might have ran you out of time on your second part of your first question, but that's what I think of when I consider what Iron Dome would have to look like.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. So it's a broader thing and just sort of call it missile defense. Yeah.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. There's a public statement by the US government that outlines a lot.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. And if I can just squeak in one last one, and then I know we got to go. How are you thinking about, I mean, Denmark is an important F-35 international customer. And there's a lot of rhetoric in the press around the US wanting Greenland. How do you think about that, and mixing that up with them being an important customer, and what message that might send other customers?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLook, these are policy issues by the US government completely out of our purview. So I'll just leave that there. The demand for the aircraft we've talked about keeps building, especially in international customers. And really, that's all I could comment on a policy matter such as this. All right. Thank you, Maria, for managing all the questions.\nBefore we close, I want to thank the Lockheed Martin workforce for constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation to help our country and our allies accomplish their missions and maintain our ability to provide a strong deterrent to armed conflict. And if we must, defeat any enemy that attacks us. And the Air Force used to call that fly, fight, and win. As we did in this first term, we look forward to a very productive working relationship with President Trump, his team, and the new Congress to strengthen our national defense.\nWe share a commitment to achieving peace through strength, and we're focused on delivering the best mission-critical defense technology in the world and at the greatest value to the American taxpayer. So with that, we'll wrap up the call. Thank you, everybody, for joining today, and we'll see you in April on our Q1 call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 2024 earnings call. Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems, and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea, and the Middle East. From the PAC-3's critical role in air defense to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation to the F-35 with its advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to allied and partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st century security strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling the defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners.\nConsequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion, greater than 2x our annual revenue.\nOur strong performance so far in 2024 extends beyond that backlog as well, giving us confidence to raise our 2024 full-year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and EPS. In the Q2, sales increased 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, and reflected growth in all four of our business segments. The supply chain continues to improve, and defense outlays also continue to increase. Our focus on operational execution helped us achieve segment operating margins of 11.3%, up 20 basis points compared to last year's Q2, and free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Jay and Maria will talk more about the specifics of the quarterly results in a moment, but suffice it to say, we are pleased with our financial performance and momentum so far in 2024.\nI'm especially happy to report the progress we have made on the F-35 program. As announced last week, we began deliveries of the first Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3, configured F-35 aircraft to the US government. The TR-3 upgrade and further Block IV enhancements represent a critical evolution in capability, and their full development remains a top priority for us. These and further software updates over the life of the program will ensure the F-35 remains an effective deterrent to aggression and the cornerstone of joint all-domain operations now and decades into the future. We continue to produce at a rate of 156 aircraft per year and expect to deliver 75 to 100 aircraft in H2 2024. Over 95% of TR-3 capabilities are currently being flight tested, and we look forward to delivering full TR-3 combat capability to the customer.\nIn addition, we expect deliveries of F-35 aircraft to exceed production for the next few years. Jay will talk about the financial aspects of our current status in a moment. Continued close collaboration with the Joint Program Office, or the JPO, as it's known, and across our industry partners has been and will be essential to meet and exceed expectations of this critical national defense program in a timely and cost-effective manner. I met with my F-35 industry CEO colleagues in Fort Worth recently to set plans for enhancing the cooperation on our software and hardware and test integration processes, among other initiatives, to increase speed and efficiency in the program.\nThe TR-3 hardware and software provide a significant upgrade in computing power that enables major improvements in capability to our airmen, sailors, and marine, as well as to our partner and allied nations.\nInternational customers continue to recognize the superior capabilities of this, the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world, and key aircraft node in the DoD's joint all-domain architecture. On the international front, Israel announced a third squadron of F-35As, increasing their fleet by 50%. Greece is in the final stages of discussion with the US government to procure the F-35, and we continue to see interest from Romania as well as a potential new customer. Beyond the F-35 as the quarterback of joint all-domain operations, our ongoing collaboration with the US military during major exercises with deployed operational units exemplifies our commitment and ability to enhance readiness and integrate capabilities across all of our customers' missions and priorities. In June, new advanced capabilities from across Lockheed Martin contributed to the 10th iteration of US Indo-Pacific Command's Valiant Shield exercise.\nDuring this exercise, there were several significant milestones demonstrating how we are continually improving our force's capabilities and enhancing our deterrence posture. One example is that we successfully integrated digital command and control capabilities with the Indo-Pacific Command's Joint Fires Network, enhancing real-time decision-making for commanders and operational agility for the force. Our operational planning data fusion engine was employed to coordinate joint operations using live real-time data, producing actual tasking orders at combat relevant speed. In another example from the same exercise, Lockheed Martin Space and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics jointly demonstrated the ability to autonomously optimize intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or ISR, collection, and enhance their imagery for quick, automated target detection and classification, facilitating data delivery across a wide range of space-based and airborne platforms like never before.\nIn addition, the US Army tested our Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, against a moving maritime target in the Pacific Ocean. This next-generation missile enables further improved range and precision to deter potential adversaries from even greater distances. According to the Army, this test is a significant step in the PrSM program's progress. We've also moved toward realizing the 21st Century Security joint all-domain vision with the signing of the landmark agreement with the Australian Department of Defense to build their future joint air battle management system. They call it Project AIR6500 Phase I.\nAs we've discussed before, this system will provide the Australian Defense Force with leading-edge integrated air and missile defense capability, using next-generation technologies to combat high-speed threats and establish Australia's integrated air and missile defense as one of the most highly advanced in the world. We also continue to demonstrate 21st Century Security in other innovative ways.\nIn May, our Skunk Works tactical artificial intelligence team successfully executed their second set of flight tests with the University of Iowa Operator Performance Laboratory. RAI flew an L-29 jet aircraft by means of heading, speed, and altitude commands sent directly to the onboard autopilot, then to the plane's flight controls. This test has shown our AI team can rapidly develop, iterate, and integrate artificial intelligence technology for autonomous flight operations. We're also making great progress in another leading-edge defense tech initiative, hypersonic strike, which is a critical element of deterrence in today's world. As announced by the Department of Defense in June, the US Navy and US Army completed an end-to-end all-up-round flight test of the Common Hypersonic Missile, core to the Navy's conventional prompt strike, or CPS, and the Army's long-range hypersonic weapons programs.\nThe test marked a major step forward for the nation's development of hypersonic systems by Lockheed Martin. Pivoting to the supply chain, we continue to explore opportunities to drive our concept of anti-fragility across the global defense industrial base. For example, we recently signed a collaborative memorandum of understanding with Rheinmetall to work together on land, air, and naval opportunities. One of our first initiatives is the new Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System, or GMARS. This is a highly interoperable two-pod launcher system intended to fire the MLRS-based munitions. Combining these combat-proven systems will help address the growing demand for long-range rocket capabilities in Europe and elsewhere.\nOn our PAC-3 program, international collaboration remains strong as well, including development of indigenous capabilities with the opening of a PAC-3 MSE facility production line in Poland, as well as a memorandum of understanding with Grupo Oesía in Spain to provide an opportunity to manufacture PAC-3 MSE parts for worldwide customers. Spain and the United States also formalized an agreement for Spain to purchase PAC-3 MSE missiles and related support, making Spain PAC-3's 16th partner nation. I'd also like to briefly discuss the latest status of the US defense budget. The House approved their version of the FY25 defense appropriations, so the focus now shifts to the Senate, where the process continues before the reconciliation phase later this year.\nWe believe our portfolio is well aligned to current and future customer mission priorities, including air superiority with the F-35, the CH-53K, and Black Hawk, or UH-60M, our integrated air and missile defense with PAC-3 and NGI, hypersonics with CPS and the LRHW I just mentioned a minute ago, and tactical strike weapons and munitions with JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, and GMARS. Ultimately, we look forward to the conclusion of the USG appropriations process and the continued utilization of the existing supplemental funding. On the international front, I was encouraged by conversations I had at the recent NATO summit a few weeks ago in Washington. International partners and allies remain steadfast in their pursuit of elevated defense spending to strengthen the overall integrated deterrence posture of the alliance, given the tragic and ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nI'll now turn it over to Jay for award highlights and additional commentary on our financial results.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim. Similar to last quarter, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financials and touch on a handful of operational items before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area financials, and then I'll come back to discuss the updated outlook. Starting on chart four, the positive momentum we had to begin the year continued into Q2, with sales up 9% to over $18 billion, led by RMS and MFC. As Jim mentioned, throughput remained strong, reflecting an improving supply chain and internal operating cadence. Segment operating profit of $2 billion was up 10% year-over-year, and consolidated margins were 11.3%, with all four business areas achieving double-digit return on sales, the first time since Q3 2022.\nNet favorable profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and were 21% of segment operating profit, driving the stronger margins. GAAP earnings per share of $6.85 increased 3% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by severance and impairment charges at RMS and Sikorsky, higher interest expense, and lower pension income. On the new business front, we recorded over $17 billion of orders in the Q2, for a book-to-bill ratio just below one. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to just under $2.8 billion.\nWe continue to make the necessary investments in innovation and infrastructure to position the company and our customers for future success, with $405 million in research and development and $370 million in capital expenditures in the Q2.\nFinally, we returned over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Now I'll touch on a few business activities in more detail. The order strength continued at MFC, with a book-to-bill over two in the quarter, led by the $4 billion-plus Army award spanning multi-year PAC-3 delivery requirements and supporting our production ramp projections. And Poland officials signed a letter of acceptance to purchase 400 JASSM-ERs, the largest international order in program history, providing another ally with the latest generation JASSM variant. At Sikorsky, its platforms remain in high demand as the US State Department announced approval for foreign military sales of Black Hawks to Austria, Brazil, and Sweden. This opens the door to the potential sale of 36 Black Hawks, adding 12 helicopters to each country's existing Black Hawk fleet.\nIn addition, the government of Greece signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 35 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters. These upgraded aircraft will support the Hellenic Ministry of Defense's ongoing modernization and will serve as a dependable multi-role helicopter with unmatched interoperability to support vital national and allied security missions. In the space domain, late last month, NASA selected Lockheed Martin to develop and build the nation's next-generation weather satellite constellation for NOAA, known as Geostationary Extended Observations, or GeoXO. This award builds on our prior work with environmental sensing technologies, which recently culminated with the launch of GOES-U, which will leverage advanced instruments and rapid updates to provide crucial data for weather forecasting, severe storm tracking, and climate monitoring.\nAll right, let me stop here and hand it over to Maria to get into the business area financial detail.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jay.\nToday, I'll discuss Q2 year-over-year results for the business areas, starting with aeronautics on chart five. Q2 sales at Aero were up 6% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit increased 5%, with higher volume and favorable mix being offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Regarding aircraft deliveries, we resumed F-35 deliveries in Q3, as Jim shared, and we've delivered our 1,000th F-35. On F-16, we delivered four in Q2 and are targeting around 20 for the year. For 130J, we delivered five in the quarter, reaching a milestone of 2,700 deliveries of this critical tactical airlifter, and expect around 20 deliveries for the year.\nTurning to Missiles and Fire Control on chart six. MFC had another strong quarter with sales up 13% from the prior year, driven by production ramps on a handful of our precision fires programs within the tactical and strike missile segment, primarily Guided Multiple launch Rocket System, GMLRS, and long-range anti-ship missile, LRASM. Segment operating profit increased 21% year-over-year due to higher profit booking rate adjustments, led by the PAC-3 and Apache programs, and margins returned to 14.5%, which is more in line with historical rates. MFC backlog reached a record level of almost $35 billion in Q2, supported by continued global demand for several of our missile and munition programs.\nKey awards included the PAC-3 award that Jay mentioned, as well as $1.3 billion in combined awards for launchers, including HIMARS, and M270 upgrades, and a $500 million follow-on production contract for JAGM, and Hellfire to support US and International customers. On the delivery front, I'll highlight a few of the key program quantities in the quarter. We delivered 100 PAC-3 interceptors, more than 2,000 GMLRS rockets, over 2,700 Hellfire missiles, and 11 HIMARS systems. Shifting to rotary and mission systems on chart seven, sales increased 17% in the quarter to over $4.5 billion, primarily driven by higher volume at integrated warfare systems and sensors on radar and laser programs, as well as the Canadian Surface Combatants program. Sikorsky programs also saw higher volume, led by Black Hawk and CH-53K.\nAlso of note in the quarter, we delivered five S-70 helicopters to international customers, which resulted in about $115 million of revenue on a passage of title POT basis. Operating profit increased 9% year-over-year due to higher volume, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Now for a brief summary of helicopter deliveries. In addition to the five S-70 helicopters I mentioned, Sikorsky delivered five Black Hawks, four combat rescue helicopters, and one VH-92 Presidential helicopter in the quarter.\nOn the delivery front, a few of the key program quantities in the Q2, we- yeah, sorry about that. Let's go to space. Finally, with space on chart eight, sales increased 1% year-over-year. The growth was driven by higher volume on strategic and missile defense programs, primarily hypersonics and fleet ballistic missile, FBM. Partially offsetting this growth was lower volume on classified programs and Orion.\nOperating profit increased 11% compared to Q2 2023, driven by favorable mix and higher profit booking rate adjustments. Now I'll turn it back over to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAll right, thanks, Maria. And let's shift over to the outlook on chart nine. Given our strong year-to-date performance, sustained backlog position, and improving visibility into key programs, we're raising our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share.\nWe're increasing sales by $1.75 billion at the midpoint, and tightening the range to $70.5 to 71.5 billion. The new midpoint reflects a solid 5% growth from 2023, with increases across all four business areas. We're also increasing segment operating profit expectation based on the higher sales, with a new range of $7.35 to 7.5 billion, and anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins to remain at 10.5%.\nBusiness area margins remain consistent with our prior guidance at Aero and MFC, while RMS is down about 50 basis points at the midpoint, and Space is up 40 basis points at the midpoint. The RMS reduction is driven by Sikorsky as the business faces continued cost pressure and absorption headwinds, the impact of which has exceeded benefits from its cost reduction programs. Conversely, space is benefiting from solid performance and proactive cost reduction efforts. Moving to earnings per share on chart 11, we're increasing the midpoint by $0.35 to 26.35, with a range of $26.10 to 26.60 for the full year.\nPrimary drivers of the change are shown on this chart, with increases coming from incremental profit of $0.49 and other below-the-line items of $0.13. Partially offsetting those items are the RMS charges totaling $0.29 from the severance actions and the asset write-downs taken in the Q2.\nAs Jim mentioned, we're encouraged by the F-35 delivery restart and continuous progress being made towards delivering full combat capability. We're holding our free cash flow expectation in the range of $6 to 6.3 billion, which absorbs a potential unfavorable impact from longer deferrals of final F-35 delivery payments. This is made possible by proactive actions taken across the company to offset these potential headwinds. On the cash deployment side, we still expect over $3 billion of IR&D and capital investments, while the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, maintain attractive shareholder returns. Lastly, on backlog, we continue to expect backlog to grow in 2024, even with the higher sales outlook, which provides a line of sight to future growth. Before I wrap, I'd like to highlight a few other key assumptions regarding the updated outlook.\nFirst, we expect F-35 Lot 18/19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. Second, we continue to expect $325 million of losses on the MFC classified program, of which $100 million has been recognized year-to-date. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contributions in 2024. So in summary, on chart 12, our solid first-half results give us confidence in raising the full-year outlook for sales, profit, and EPS while holding the cash flow outlook, reflecting our ongoing efforts to deliver predictable and improving operating and financial performance as is expected of us. It all starts with relentless focus on executing our programmatic commitments and delivering critical 21st Century Security mission capabilities, where we strive to continuously improve.\nTo that end, we are investing in our people, processes, and systems through the 1LMX transformation, with the goal of unlocking step changes in efficiency, velocity, and program execution that deliver security capabilities at a head-of-need speed to our customers. We're confident that these management priorities and actions convert to a compelling long-term value proposition for customers and shareholders alike. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And if you wish to ask a question, please press 1, then 0 on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an announcer indicating that you've been placed in the queue, and you may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing the 1, then 0 again. If you're using a speakerphone or Bluetooth, please pick up your handset before pressing the number.\nOnce again, if you have a question, please press 1, then 0 at this time. The first question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, Jim. Jay, Maria. Greetings from Farnborough. The F-16 is flying in the background right now, so apologies for the roar in the background. So the delivery guidance,\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLet's call it the sound of freedom, Kristine. It's good.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI mean, it's a crazy roar. Beautiful aircraft here. So the delivery guidance for the F-35 in the second half of this year is still fairly wide. Can you talk about the scenarios where there are lower and upper? What would have to happen for you to hit the lower upper end of the range? And also, with production at 156 per year, when should delivery and production catch up for the program?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo, Kristine, I'll start and emphasize that we're going to do this unwind and conduct the deliveries with safety and quality as our number one priority. So just starting with that foundation, we actually have the ability to add resources which have already been identified and designated, and that's test pilots, maintenance team, and software and hardware engineers to get the flight test done that we need to be at the higher end of that range. But we want to make sure that if it's weather, if it's pilot crew rest issues, anything like that, we will accommodate for those. But we have the resources in place, I'll say, that should enable us to get to the higher end of that range, if you will.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. Let me just add, just to reiterate, Kristine, we expect anywhere between 75 to 110.\nYes, with less than six months left, it is a wide range. I would say over the next few months, we'll get much better insights into the induction and flow of aircraft going into the test and production cycle, really bringing in aircraft that are parked as well as aircraft that are coming outside from the production flow. And as we get those learnings, we'll be able to get a better assessment of what the delivery requirements will be and what we expect for the year. And so it'll take us a couple of months just to make sure we get that process learned out. It's well planned, but we actually have to demonstrate it in actual practice.\nAs far as the future, in terms of reducing on the backlog of aircraft, our target is anywhere between 12 to 18 aircraft deliveries per month, and really to burn down the aircraft backlog. So that'll take us a number of years here to get through that. We've already made progress so far. Since the announcement of the restart, we've delivered 10 aircraft as of Monday, yesterday, six with the TR-3 configuration and four with the TR-2 configuration. So we think we're off to a very good start. But again, we really need to just monitor the operating cadence of being able to bring aircraft from two different flows into one flight test flow. Again, we'll tighten that up later on in the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Thanks so much.\nSo I think you did say that next year you're going to deliver more F-35s than you will produce. And I think at one point you mentioned that you get paid $7 million upon each delivery. Walk us through. You mentioned also the deferral of some payments. So next year, what happens to accrued revenues? Because I think with higher deliveries, I assume the final delivery payment basically is incremental, even though under POC, the work itself should be relatively level. And then secondly, the cash flow impact. I know that there's a deferral on the payments, but if it was really $7 million, that's potentially a substantial cash flow plus. Thanks so much.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Cai, let me just say, first of all, as Jim mentioned, restarting delivery was an important first step really towards delivering the fully combat-capable aircraft.\nAircraft, the withholds these final delivery payments is a timing item, as you mentioned. We're working with the customer to finalize the terms of those final delivery payments. We're making excellent progress, but it would be immature or premature to give the details of that because it remains subject to negotiation. Suffice it to say that you will see a timing benefit over the next few years as we deliver, but I think we still need to work through and finalize this agreement with the customer. As far as the revenue, I really wouldn't expect much of an incremental benefit in terms of revenue. We continue to build at a 156 rate. We are seeing production a little bit higher this year, but for the most part, we should expect that to be, I think, fairly stable.\nAnd yes, we'll see incremental activity in terms of test activity, which does increase penetration in a percent complete basis, but I don't really view that being all that material, and so I would just hold the production. We will expect F-35 to grow mostly from sustainment next year and in the years to come. I think it's important to mention as well that the headwind on these final delivery payments are here in 2024. We're holding our outlook, so we're absorbing that with better performance in the rest of the portfolio.\nYes, we will see the timing benefits downstream. But as I mentioned before, we have to get just the whole delivery cadence straight. And I just want to make sure I had it straight in terms of the last question. We're targeting anywhere between 12 to 18 months to fully deliver on these parked aircraft.\nAnd as I mentioned, we just need to iron out the process over the next few months here to be able to give better guidance on that.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Deuschle Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Deuschle Bank\n\nJay, you've been seeing some nice momentum on revenue, and now you're seeing some of it on margins as well. I guess at what point do you think you'll be ready to start talking about maybe a better medium-term free cash flow per share growth outlook than this mid-single-digit rate you've been talking about for a while? Do you just need to lap these pension headwinds next year and see a bit more growth acceleration, and then you're there? Just curious for now. Yeah. We'll look. I'm glad you're thinking about that. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. No, I appreciate the question. We've said over the last few months, and really the last year or so, that our goal has been to increase absolute free cash flow in the low single-digit clip, and then that augmented with share repurchase would get us to a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share expectation. That remains the outlook. We'll go through our multi-year forecast over the next few months here, and we'll be able to give you a better update in the October timeframe. I think, given the fact that we're at a higher level in 2024, is a positive, and we continue to expect to grow in 2025 off this higher baseline. So that in and of itself should result in a higher cash flow baseline as well.\nBut there's a lot of work to be done between now and then, and so I would like to have the benefit of going through that in more detail, and we'll update that to you at least preliminarily in October.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Deuschle Bank\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nGavin Parson\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. Morning. Morning. Maybe sticking on revenue, you guys have talked about supply chain kind of being a bottleneck. Is the upside more on the demand front or on the unlocking of the supply chain side? And if the latter, can you just talk a little bit more about supply chain and what you expect going forward in the second half? Because I think the second half implies a lot less growth.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, I'd say it's a combination of both.\nWe ended the year in 2023 with a $160 billion backlog, which was a record. We ended here the Q2 at $158 billion, which was slightly below where it ended at a record, with significantly higher sales than we thought through the first half of the year. We expect—I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to expect the backlog to increase at the end of this year, which gives us more visibility into further growth in 2025 and beyond. So we're very bullish on where that stands from a backlog standpoint. As far as supply chain, we did see improvement. We are seeing continued improvement there and on-time delivery.\nThe part shortages continue to come down. Having said that, there are still areas, particularly where we're ramping up some of our major programs, where we still have some work to be done there.\nWe're still going through many of the initiatives and proactive actions that we've talked about in the past, which is some insourcing on some capabilities, dual sourcing where it makes sense. Also, we have deployed and we continue to deploy personnel to provide on-site assistance at our suppliers. Of course, we will continue to look at product redesign. But I'd say by and large, we are seeing an improvement in the supply chain, which also gives us confidence for that continued growth in the future.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGavin, I'll just give you some qualitative background on demand side. Our strategy includes driving the latest digital technologies kind of through an open architecture standard-based system to the DoD. By doing that and making our products, services, platforms compliant or in line with those future concepts of open architecture and standards to pull through those products, services, and platforms.\nSo we're starting to see that already, and we're demonstrating whether it's exercises or in real conflict like in the Red Sea, doing things like over-the-air updates to the Aegis system, which is decades old, but it can be improved very quickly now. Just like when you get a download overnight on your Tesla, we can do a download overnight over the air on the Aegis radar and combat control system and double, triple the effectiveness against things like low-flying drones and cruise missiles. So we're actually implementing those kinds of things on a standards-based architecture into our products and services today, which I expect will continue to pull them through.\n\nGavin Parson\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nGreat. Appreciate the detail.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Alembic Global\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Good morning. Guys, Missiles and Fire Control, if you think about what was appropriated in the 2024 baseline budget and the Ukraine supplemental, how much order flow is still to come there for you guys at MFC? And also just if we think about the growth cadence there, you talked about $750 million a year in the past. You're going to be well above that this year. So I'm just wondering if that cadence is going to come back into play in 2025 on the higher baseline. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. I mean, there's still plenty of runway and orders at MFC. As I mentioned, the book-to-bill in the quarter was a buck two, and we're still expecting additional orders at the end of the year, particularly in JASSM/LRASM in the second half here. There's still even on the supplemental, there's some opportunity there to continue to build their backlog.\nWe've talked about $750 million. You're right. They're going to be above that this year. We see continued growth there next year, and they're going to be, again, the highest grower within Lockheed Martin for the next three to five years. We're pretty bullish on that. Much of that is already in the backlog, but there's still plenty more to come in terms of continuing to build that backlog. The key for us is to make sure that we can meet the demand and ramp up all these programs to our customer's requirements. The team has been laser-focused on making sure they can do that. You're seeing the benefits of that this year with their sales coming in higher. Again, we keep our head down, continue to deliver. The demand is both domestic, and international at MFC.\nAgain, they're going to be a significant source of growth for Lockheed Martin for the next three to five years.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nPete, it's Jim. Again, on a qualitative perspective, I tell our teams and our executives internally, we're in the aerospace and defense industry, but we're in the deterrence business, right? So if you step back and say, \"What contributes to deterrence from an MFC, for example?\" I think anybody that's ever watched a Clint Eastwood movie will know that if we run out of ammunition, you're in a lot of trouble, right? So part of deterrence is showing that, A, you have enough ammunition stocks to prevail and sustain your operations from an aggressor. That's the first thing. Second thing is it's helpful to demonstrate that you can produce at rate and ramp that rate quickly. That's our anti-fragility program.\nAnd the third piece of it is you can produce and repair MFC and other products in the local theater and not have to bring them all the way back to the US to fix them or to drive that production up. That's the third part of our strategy. So everything we do is based on deterrence and strengthening that. And MFC has a huge role in making sure that adversaries know that we've got enough stocks in MFC-type products, and we can ramp that rate, and we can produce in different places and repair in different places should they act. And that's really kind of a qualitative underpinning of what Jay was talking about.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Alembic Global\n\nAppreciate it, guys. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much, and good morning. Probably just a quick one. Sorry about the background noise here.\nJust a quick one and kind of big picture. I think, Jay, I think you've said in the past that there was good potential for growth to be at least as strong as 2024 and 2025, and good potential for that growth rate to accelerate. Is that still the case off of the higher revenue base and the higher growth rate here in 2024?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nIt's a good question, Seth. And as I mentioned before, we're just going through our process to lay out our multi-year outlook, including 2025, here over the next few months. What I would tell you is that the backlog visibility that we have would support another year similar to 2024. We have to go through, though, and the practical operational capability to deliver that is something we have to go through. And so the demand is there.\nWe have to make sure the supply can meet that as well. That's a pretty significant step change over really a two-year span on some of these ramp programs that we're dealing with. And as I mentioned before, we're still dealing with some programs that are still working through trying to get up to the ramp rates.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe if we could talk about profitability. If we look at first-half profitability of 10%, 11%, second half implied in the low 10s, can you walk through some of the moving pieces, maybe in terms of supply chain productivity? I know volumes are lower, and how we think about the exit rate for the year. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah.\nThe second half of the year, Sheila, I mean, the most significant would be the program loss at MFC that we have to record in the second half. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have recorded about $100 million here year to date. And in the second half, we expect about another $225 million. So that'll put pressure on margins in the back half. The second piece I would say is that even though we had a very strong and solid profit adjustment first half, that slows down a little bit in the back half for the year just based on program timing, the timing of risk retirements.\nAnd so the risk retirements and profit adjustments are not all linear. They occur at different aspects of a program lifecycle. But what I would say is we feel comfortable with where we're headed.\nWe've talked about 2024 being a low-water mark for all net margins, and we expect it to improve gradually over the next few years, and we still feel confident that can take place.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAll right.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to see, and apologies if I missed this, but can you comment on your view of NGAD and how you're thinking about that now moving forward and what we might be thinking about in terms of the next catalyst for you on this particular program?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure can. It's Jim here. So when it comes to NGAD as a program, we're not authorized in the industry to speak to the details of that. So you'd have to go to the US government to get insight into that particular program.\nBut I can tell you what we're doing to prepare for the next generation combat aircraft. So some of those are on the investment front. In 2021, rather, we opened the gates on four high-tech facilities that have the security clearance capability to produce NGAD-type components, let's call them, all right? One of them's in Florida. Skunk Works in California. Opened a new major factory that I was there to see. We have it in Alabama, two in Georgia. So we have these accredited facilities up and running ahead of the demand, and we're working on programs and products in that classified capability space. So we've already got these facilities up and running.\nThe other resource we have is humans in Skunk Works, Marietta, and in Fort Worth and other places that can design, test, and build using our digital transformation engineering technologies and a digital twin, these kind of components, aircraft and others that might go into an NGAD concept. So I can just tell you that Lockheed Martin's ready to produce. We're ready to design.\nWe're ready to build. We are in the process of making sure we're capable in the arenas that the Air Force and the Navy are going to need us to be. So that's really all we can say about that. But I can assure you that we are competitive and ready to go in this space if and when the government pulls a trigger on a real competition and wants somebody to be able to produce, we can do it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space, Melius Research\n\nHey, good afternoon, or I guess it's still morning. But wanted to ask you about on F-35, and congrats on the resumption of deliveries, but when we think about TR-3 and on the production side of the equation, how is the supply chain in terms of being able to supply enough material and integrated core processors on time for you to maintain the 156 per year? So as the mix goes more toward all TR-3, how well prepared is the supply chain for that?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo we got together, Rob, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in the prepared remarks in Fort Worth about a month ago with the CEOs of half of those companies that contribute to this in a significant way.\nWe communicated the importance of exactly what you're speaking to, which is not just the core processor, but there's a range and number of other components across all of these companies that need to maintain or increase their production rates and modernize their equipment along the way. And so that communication of those suppliers has been made. They know our plans. We're well integrated, more integrated than we ever have, I think, when it comes to test and planning and design, iterative software across multiple companies, etc. So we're in a position, and our suppliers are telling us they will meet the demand. We will monitor them and continue to even put people in their sites when we need to to make sure that happens.\nBut we've got the major suppliers together, and they understand the demand rate, quality level we need, and a better integration plan for test and development that we have built going forward.\n\nRob Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space, Melius Research\n\nAnd Jim, just following on to that, how do we think about the cadence for retrofit from TR-2 to 3?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo you're right, Rob, that this is designed for backward integration, if you will. There'll be a schedule that the US Government comes up with for TR-3. Maybe it will be up to them as to the cadence, the investment rate, etc. But over a period of time, there will be a great number of originally built TR-2 aircraft that will get converted for some hardware and software upgrades to that.\n\nRob Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space, Melius Research\n\nIs this the kind of thing you expect to be talking about soon, or this is a few years out? We should be focusing on new production aircraft for now for TR-3?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So again, this is a US government policy decision, so it's better to request that kind of commentary from them, Rob. But we're, again, ready to do it at the rate that we expect that they come at us with.\n\nRob Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space, Melius Research\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nJay, could you give us the updated, I guess, if you snapped the line today or just ballpark as you see it, cash flow, pension contribution, and cash recovery for at least 2025? And I guess if you had it and were willing to give it beyond that would be helpful.\nAnd then I guess can you talk through the pieces of how you grow absolute dollar-free cash flow in 2025 given the pension headwind you have and how it compares to how quickly you can grow the segment even?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So on cash recovery, this year we're a little bit under, say, $1.7 billion. We expect that to step down by, in the range of, about $100 million and probably stay at that level for the next few years after that. As far as absolute free cash flow in terms of the buildup of the components to being able to continue to grow, yes, we've talked about pension being a headwind. We've talked about being in the range of about $1 billion.\nThe areas that we expect to drive cash flow growth would be continued earnings growth, as you discussed, their net income growth, in addition to some of these benefits on the timing on the F-35. We've talked also about just working capital in general. Even when you put F-35 aside, what we're looking at and going after is our contract asset. If you look here in the Q2, that was a nearly $14 billion balance that we had. That's represented in the range. I'll put that in terms of efficiency, around 70, 72 days of sales running through the balance at the moment. Since 2020 or so, that's grown from about 55 days.\nSo there's an element of there in kind of the F-35 and what we've gone through over the past couple of years here, but there's also been growth outside of the F-35 that represents a lot of opportunity for us to convert into faster billings at a level that we've been able to demonstrate in the past. And that's what we've been focused with on all of the business areas in terms of driving that on a multi-year basis back down to what we've been able to demonstrate. The next thing I'll say, so besides working capital and contract assets that are bringing up biggest opportunity, is the reduction of payments related to the tax R&D capitalization. So we'll get in the range, I'd say, about $150 million of benefit just through lower payments there.\nSo when you bring all these things together, we think that they generate a path to overcome what we're seeing in the pension and drive us to this target of low single digits. It's not easy. It's not a slam dunk, but we've got a path to be able to do that. And that's what we're driving today to be able to deliver next year and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Armet\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, Jay. And Jay, maybe this is just for you on the just talking about you've talked a lot about MSC's production ramp that you're going to have over the next couple of years.\nJust how does this all tie in with the collaborative agreement you got with Rheinmetall now, PAC-3 production opening up in Poland, and I think Jim also mentioned Spain, an agreement there? Just can you give us an update on PAC-3, what the growth kind of expansion looks like now, and same, I guess, on some HIMARS and JASSM, what some of those growth rates look like? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. A lot of these agreements enable. They're part of in-country requirements for industrial cooperation. You mentioned Poland. Jim mentioned Germany, also Australia. And those are enablers for us to build up this backlog and drive this demand. On the PAC-3 specifically, we expect to get to 550 in 2025 and then to 650 by 2027.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content2": "And so all of these orders and these partnerships that we're signing up are all enablers to us to be able to produce and deliver at those rates. And it's not just PAC-3. We've talked about GMLRS going from 10,000 to 14,000. We've talked about Javelin going from 2,000 to about 4,000. We've talked about JASSM and LRASM going from about 700 a year to 1,100 a year. So all of these orders that we're seeing, all of these customer engagements that we have, both domestic and international, are all enablers to drive to these rates that we're building to. And so what they do is fill in the bucket to bring us to that backlog that's necessary for us to generate those sales. And we're on track to that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nYeah. Good morning, everybody. Jim, I wanted to just throw a big picture one at you and maybe have you kind of wrap all of this together and kind of what you're seeing both in the near and in the long term. And maybe just get your sense of maybe with a few more quarters here of hindsight, some of the lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine, what you at Lockheed have learned from that, whether you're kind of investing in any new areas as a result of that, and kind of the feedback loop that you're getting from your customer, both here in the United States as well as some of our allied nations as well.\nAre we seeing a development of a new set of requirements and investment areas and kind of where are you spending and how are you going about doing it? Just a big picture.\nHere we are, middle of 2024. What have we learned from Ukraine and what are we doing?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo, Jason, I would say that there's a wide range of lessons from the Ukraine conflict, unfortunate as it is, but there's learning from it. One is that traditional systems, if you will, like Javelin at the initial invasion, made a significant contribution to the initial defense of Ukraine because it was a classic armor attack and armor-supported infantry attack, meaning there were armored vehicles that were spearheading the drive to Kyiv. And when those vehicles got out in front of their support system, the Javelin, for example, made a tremendous difference in stopping that attack short, right? So you have a traditional system that was designed for land warfare, traditional land warfare, if you will, that was highly effective. So we did learn from that. Now there's jamming both ways.\nThere's electronic warfare. There's cyber. And it's like I tell my teams, like your high school wrestling coach said, \"For every move, there's a counter move.\" So if you jam GPS, we tweak the system, either the satellite or the receiver, or have an alternative form of navigation or targeting, and we react to that. So on one hand, traditional systems are still effective. On the other hand, you have to be able to adapt quickly. I'd say that was the main lesson there. Another one's a similar situation. PAC-3, again, decades in service. And now there's a hypersonic missile threat from Russia, which was launched on a number of occasions. I think all of those occasions, none of those missiles were successfully reaching their target because the PAC-3 was modified to be able to address the hypersonic missile threat.\nAnd then we'll go to kind of the other side of the issue, which is, again, drones became a more important element of land warfare than they had been before. And in sea warfare, actually, Ukrainians use autonomous sea vehicles to a significant extent and success, and also drones and unmanned aerial vehicles too. So this is not the first time. Those kinds of systems have been used in prior conflicts, including in the Middle East, and the counterterrorism wars, if you will. But the Ukrainians took it to a new level, literally sinking capital ships with unmanned aerial systems. So there were lessons there too. That's something our company is quite involved with. A lot of it's classified, whether it's kinetic or surveillance, unmanned aerial systems, but we're learning from those too.\nSo we work with drones as small as ones that a Marine can unpack from a backpack and launch by hand to aircraft-sized drones, if you will. So we're involved in that game, and we did take the lessons from the Ukraine war. And that's traditional systems are still essential at bulk and scale. And secondly, they have to be much more adaptable than they ever had to be before. And that kind of supports our digital technology effort and campaign to say, Let's use those best digital technologies to make those legacy systems better and better all the time and not wait for a conflict to force us to do that.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Treasurer and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nGreat. Hey, Lois, I think we've come to the top of the hour. So I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria.\nSo before we close, I'd like to thank our Lockheed Martin team whose dedicated efforts advanced our customers' missions and propelled our solid results this quarter, as you heard from Jay. Our capabilities are recognized around the world as the best in defense tech. And that is thanks to our employees' hardwork, dedication, and commitment to continued innovation. With 21st Century Security technologies I just described, our robust backlog, and focus on transforming our operations through our internal digital transformation program, our company has a strong foundation for growth for years to come. So I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in October. And Lois, that concludes our call for today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. If you would like to ask a question, please press one then zero now. At this time for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you, Lois, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer.

These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call.\nPlease access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q1 2024 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin today's discussion with a brief overview of our quarterly financial results, the state of the US Department of Defense budget, status updates on some key programs, and recent advancements made to support our vision of 21st Century Security that integrates the latest digital technologies. Then Jay and Maria will provide more detailed information about quarterly highlights and financials.\nThe increasingly unstable geopolitical environment in the world today makes it essential for industry and government to strengthen our nation's capabilities to deter and defend against further aggressive behavior against the US and our allies. We here at Lockheed Martin are continuing to invest heavily to improve our design and production capabilities while actively partnering with leading companies inside and outside the A and D industry to incorporate a wide range of technologies. As a result, we delivered robust revenue growth across the company, and we maintained a robust backlog of $159 billion, reflecting alignment between our advanced technology solutions and our customer's key missions and priorities. These Q1 results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full-year financial expectations we shared in the most recent earnings call.\nMoreover, the approved FY2024 defense budget reflected many positives for Lockheed Martin, consistent with national defense strategy priorities too. Highlights include robust funding for munitions, multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, the fleet ballistic missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission, including F-35 aircraft, C-130s, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M, and others, in addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, GMLRS, and PAC-3, as well as Conventional Prompt Strike and the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. In addition to that, the Next Generation Interceptor is getting support, which I'll address more in a moment.\nThis week, funding of $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel, and Indo-Pacific security supplementals passed the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate. We expect FY2025 presidential budget request, and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company, giving us further confidence in our long range plan.\nWhile demand for these key programs remains elevated, it is also essential that our program performance in terms of quality, safety, cost, and schedule gets and stays at the highest level on our most significant programs. I, Jay, and my senior executive team are personally and directly involved on the F-35.\nWe remain focused on program execution in terms of concurrent development, production, and sustainment, and we are bringing all relevant resources across our company and collaborating closely with our customers and suppliers to fully implement the TR-3 capabilities that everybody's looking forward to getting. These capabilities based on the new core processor, data storage unit, and pilot display will ensure that the F-35 is not only the most capable and effective fighter aircraft in the world, but it will also further advance its abilities to act as the air domain quarterback of joint all-domain operations for the US and its allies. We're encouraged by the solid progress made over the last few months towards resuming deliveries, including improvement in aircraft mission system capabilities, and system stability as we advance from prior software versions towards a combat training capable configuration.\nFlight testing of this configuration is now underway, and we're on a path we expect to be on with regard to maturing the system with approximately 95% of TR-3 capabilities in this flight test program. The test results to date support our expected timeline of delivering the first TR-3 combat training capable aircraft in Q3 and then transition to a fully combat capable aircraft in 2025 as planned. There will be continual software updates to support further capability insertions over the Block 4 program and beyond. While there were no final deliveries of F-35 jets in Q1, we're maintaining our production rate and continue to expect an aircraft delivery range for 2024 between 75 and 110, which requires timely receipt of the necessary hardware from TR-3 suppliers along the way.\nThe F-35's advanced combat and interoperability capabilities continue to create strong demand for the aircraft internationally too. In the quarter, the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team with a signed letter of offer and acceptance, making it official, its intent to procure 24 F-35s. In addition, the US Department of State approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35s, and Singapore announced its intent to purchase 8 F-35s to complement the 12 F-35Bs to which it has already previously committed.\nAlso, in the lower air domain, while we're disappointed in the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Program, or FARA, Sikorsky remains committed to delivering innovative and reliable aviation capabilities to our domestic and global customers. With a strong foundation of more than $20 billion in backlog, bolstered by expected and funded growth in the heavy-lift CH-53K helicopter program, Sikorsky's multi-year outlook is stable. We're also encouraged by the Army's renewed commitment to Black Hawk production and modernization, as well as our ability to address mission gaps with capability upgrades that leverage Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio of solutions in the lower air domain, things such as autonomy, AI, et cetera. Turning now to missile defense missions, which, given recent world events, are becoming more critical than ever. We continue to lead the industry.\nLast week the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, selected Lockheed Martin to deliver the new homeland missile defense capability for the United States, which is called the Next Generation Interceptor, or NGI. As MDA's NGI prime contractor, Lockheed Martin will provide the most modern, reliable, and technically advanced interceptor in the history of this system.\nThis program was 1LMX. That's our digital transformation born digital program, meaning we embraced model-based engineering, digital tools, processes, and technologies from the very, very start of this program. Now, as it continues on its path to the critical design review, integration with broader weapons system and flight tests, I'm proud of the Lockheed Martin team that enabled all of this. We were MDA's early down select before it was even on their schedule because we're so far in front to get this essential homeland defense capability off to a fast start. Earlier this quarter, the Long Range Discrimination Radar, or LRDR, completed final acceptance and was officially handed over to the Missile Defense Agency in preparation for an operational capability baseline decision. What that means is final transition to active service for that radar to help defend the country.\nThe LRDR is a cutting-edge national asset, providing the benefits of both low- and high-frequency radars to search, track, and discriminate incoming missiles with an open system approach, enabling the customer to add incremental capabilities such as hypersonic defense. This is located up in Alaska and the prime location where we can sense early what any attack might look like and respond to it. What that really does though is create an elevated deterrence to any kind of attack like that. So it's really great to have LRDR about ready to go online now. Both NGI and LRDR will be critical elements within the overall homeland defense mission and they're going to be integrated into the broader defense architecture with a battle management system that we call Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications, or as the military calls it, C2BMC.\nSo that's the system that's going to be used to integrate the radars, the missiles, and allow us to defend the country. In April, Lockheed Martin was selected for a potential 10-year $4 billion follow-on C2BMC next-generation contract with the MDA, demonstrating again our leadership position in battle management systems for homeland defense. Under this contract, we'll continue to modernize and expand the system's capabilities to enhance global integration, improve space domain awareness, and optimize sensor connectivity and data fusion to levels never done before. All of which will create the most complete picture of these incoming threats, as I just spoke about a minute ago.\nSeparately, we also continue to advance our 21st Century Security solution through collaboration with strategic commercial partners across the tech, telecom, microprocessor, and other industries to support the national defense. Citing just one example, we announced Lockheed Martin will work with Intel to support the Simulated Transition for Advanced Microelectronics Packaging or STAMP program for the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This CHIPS Act related collaboration will provide a revolutionary leap in defense systems capabilities using high performance US-built semiconductors. Over the next 18 months, we'll integrate our latest Sensor Open Systems Architecture technology with Intel semiconductors with the intent to ultimately implement, test, and complete production through the US Navy's Lockheed Martin MH-60 Romeo helicopter program. I'll now turn it over to Jay for award highlights and some additional commentary on our financial results. Jay.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim. I'll cover the consolidated results and touch on some additional highlights before handing it off to Maria, who will discuss the quarterly financials by business area, and then I'll come back to discuss the outlook and close out the remarks, starting with chart four. We had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales of $17.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. While the results benefited from an extra calendar week compared to 2023, normalized year-over-year sales growth was a solid 5%. We saw strong labor and material throughput indicative of an improving supply chain. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to enhance quality and performance proactively and, as needed, expand the breadth and depth of our engagement at supplier locations.\nSegment operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% year-over-year with margins of 10.1% and included the anticipated $100 million reach forward loss associated with the classified missile program at MFC. Excluding this charge, Lockheed Martin segment margins were 10.7%, primarily reflecting year-over-year lower profit adjustments. GAAP earnings per share of $6.39 were down 3% as year-over-year benefits from higher profit and lower share count were more than offset by higher interest expense, lower pension income, and mark-to-market gains. book-to-bill in Q1 was just below 1. Notably, Space booked several large national security orders in the quarter, including SDA Tracking Layer and other significant classified awards, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 and record backlog of $33 billion.\nAt Space, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter after investing $360 million in research and development and $380 million in capital expenditures. Share repurchases were $1 billion and we returned $780 million through our dividend.\nShifting over to additional highlights in the quarter, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the F-16 program. The first three F-16 Block 70 jets ferried from Greenville, South Carolina to Bahrain in March. To date, Lockheed Martin has produced five F-16 Block 70 jets for Bahrain, with additional 11 in various stages of production and testing. We also presented the first two F-16 Block 70 aircraft to Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, underscoring the deepening partnership between the two countries. In addition, the State Department notified Congress of authorization of the sale of 40 F-16s and related upgrades and support to Turkey. The latest deal builds on our long relationship and history with Turkish Air Force. We are confident the F-16 Block 70 and Viper upgrade package provides advanced 21st century security capabilities with affordable operating and life cycle costs for Turkey.\nWe also continue to upgrade our weapon systems for longer range standoff capability. In February in the US, the Extended Range ER variant of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system achieved success in its first operational test. The US Army fired two unitary warhead ER GMLRS variants with a HIMARS launcher, demonstrating precision and advancing this capability closer to production. The US Army also awarded Lockheed Martin the fourth production contract for early operating capability precision strike missiles known as PrSM. This award will allow for a significant increase in production quantities to meet Army demand for long range surface to surface missiles and hypersonics. Following the recent end-to-end flight test, we completed the test program of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARRW with full confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. We have demonstrated successful all-up round end-to-end performance on multiple occasions.\nARRW provides the US with the earliest air-launch fully qualified production-ready supersonic solution, hypersonic solution, I'm sorry, and Lockheed Martin is prepared to quickly deliver additional tactical, operational, and leave-behind hypersonic strike assets that can be rapidly deployed to the US Military. We also continue to advance hypersonic strike capability in the land and sea domains through the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon and Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Both solutions have a full year of milestones ahead as we progress towards operational capability. Shifting to the integrated air and missile defense arena. The Aegis Weapon System successfully executed one of the most complicated ballistic missile defense tests in Q1 when the system tracked and intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile amidst multiple decoys. The test employed the latest updates to the system and demonstrates the reliability of Aegis to operate in a dynamic threat environment.\nAnd we're constantly evolving the Aegis system. This quarter, we made further progress on our efforts to integrate with PAC-3 to enable an affordable, combat-proven IAMD capability for maritime engagements, and expand the mission capability of our systems. I'll pause here, and let me turn it over to Maria to cover the business areas.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks Jay. Today I will discuss first quarter year-over-year results for the business areas starting with aeronautics on Chart 5. First quarter sales at Aeronautics were over $6.8 billion up 9% year-over-year, and that's 1% normalized for the extra week in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and Skunk Works and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit is comparable year-over-year with higher volume being offset by lower margin development contract mix and lower net profit adjustments mainly on the F-35. Aeronautics backlog remains at a healthy $57 billion which includes 373 F-35s, 80 C-130Js, and 132 F-16s supporting growth into 2025 and beyond.\nTurning to missiles and fire control on chart 6, sales increased 25% from the prior year, 16% normalized for the extra week driven by production ramps on tactical and strike missile programs, primarily GMLRS, HIMARS, and JASSM, LRASM. Integrated Air and Missile Defense also saw higher volume on PAC-3 and THAAD. As expected, segment operating profit decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the $100 million loss on the classified program Jay mentioned previously. Normalizing for the loss, MFC's margins would have been 13.7%. Now I'd like to provide a quick update on our annual production capacity plans for key programs. PAC-3 is currently at 500 missiles growing to 550 in 2025 and 650 by 2027. GMLRS currently is at 10,000 missiles, growing to 14,000 by 2025, JASSM, LRASM currently at about 650 missiles, growing to 1,100 by 2026, and HIMARS currently at 72 launchers, growing to 96 next year.\nShifting to Rotary and Mission Systems on Chart 7, sales increased 16% in the quarter, 8% normalized for the extra week, driven by higher volume across the entire portfolio including radar and laser programs within Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors, various programs within C6ISR, and the CH-53K and Seahawk programs within Sikorsky. Operating profit increased 23% due to higher volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit adjustments. Finally, with space on Chart 8, sales increased 10% year-over-year, 2% normalized for the extra week to approximately $3.3 billion.\nThe growth was driven by higher volume on the Fleet Ballistic Missile program and ramp ups on hypersonic and next generation interceptor programs within Strategic and Missile Defense, as well as higher volume on Space Development Agency Transport and Tracking Layer programs within National Security Space. Operating profit increased 16% compared to Q1 2023, driven by higher volume in ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower net profit adjustments primarily on the next gen OPIR program. Now I'll turn it back to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks Maria, let's turn to the outlook on Chart 9. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we said in January, with the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve the consolidated full year outlook. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $6 to $6.3 billion, including over $3 billion of independent research and development and capital investments, while the dividend along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases support our return to shareholders targeting a mid single digit free cash flow per share growth over the longer term. All right, to close out and summarize on Chart 10, we're off to a solid start in 2024 and remain laser focused on execution to our customer and programmatic commitments while building momentum towards delivering our full year guidance through our 1LMX transformation.\nWe are reengineering our internal processes by providing the automations and capabilities needed to drive efficiency, increase velocity, and enhance key captures and programs. 1LMX will enable us to combine the depth and breadth of our portfolio with the expertise and dedication of our people to drive 21st Century Security solutions for our customers and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, and if you wish to ask a question, please press one then zero on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an annunciator indicating that you've been placed into queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the 10 again. If you're using a speakerphone or Bluetooth, please pick up your handset before pressing the number once again. If you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. Our first question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nI'd like to start to make sure we have a good understanding of the F-35 right now with TR-3. As you said, the Air Force has talked about this as well, and it looks like that timeline's moved back to some point in Q3, and there's just been a great deal of slippage in the timeline over the last few years. Block 4 has been delayed, and the new budget has cut deliveries in 2025 and 2026 ostensibly to avoid having to do later Block 4 upgrades.\nYou've been able to keep production and revenues up, although deliveries and cash payments are off. But how can we get confident in the trajectory? And perhaps Jim, maybe you could talk about what a positive or more negative scenario might look like for production and deliveries over the next two years and what it would mean for the revenue and cash trajectory.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, Doug. So I think it's important to understand that we're doing, as I said earlier, concurrent development and production, and then advancing the sustainment capability as well, all at the same time. Most of these complex programs go through a period of development and then a production run largely off of that design base or that engineered base of what the aircraft's supposed to look like and how it's going to perform. The F-35 is different in a sense. That development's been going on since the day the program started years and years ago, and it's going on today. Now, the good news about that is you have step function increases in capability every few years. And as a result of the F-35's capacity to do that, the government just came out and extended the expected service life of the aircraft another decade or two, I think it was.\nSo this is a good thing, but it's also an extremely difficult thing to do and even to predict schedule, right? It's our responsibility to hold cost and schedule, but we don't control all the variables, let me just say, and that's okay. We're still the OEM, we're still responsible. And so what we've run into on TR3 is just the level of complexity and executing the step function increase. That's pretty.\nI'd say novel or dramatic. What the team is doing at our company is we're integrating a series of components, devices, software, and managing and integrating all of that. And so what's happening now is we are ringing out all the.\nSoftware through all of the new hardware and integrating it into all the aircraft other systems. That's taken longer than our team predicted. The way we're going to get at that is if you think of it as a release one and a release two. We've got a lot of confidence in this stage, Doug. Release one, if you can think of it that way, is what we're calling, along with the US Government, a combat training capable aircraft. Meaning we can get these jets in the hands of squadron, wing, and.\nRegional commanders so that they can start training their pilots on them and training their maintenance organizations and also getting their bases and infrastructure, spare parts, pools, and everything else sort of in operational shape, if you will. Once we get the final software load for the fully combat capable version of TR-3 sometime in the next few months, then those aircraft could be deployed into actual combat operations and you'll have the training, the maintenance, the operational.\nPatterns and procedures on how to actually fly the jet in combat. So we'd like to be able to do it sooner, but this is the schedule we're on. And I'd say for the combat training capable aircraft, we're highly confident based on the test results so far, that those will be deliverable in Q3. Jay, you want to say anything else about cash flow?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, sure, Doug. I'll just add, as Jim mentioned, this combat training capable capability and configuration, as Jim mentioned, supports the training of the squadrons, standing up to new squadrons, and decreasing the amount of time the aircraft are parked. All that. What that does is really avoids any type of significant disruption. So what this does is really keep our production on track here in 2024 and then beyond as well. As Jim mentioned, in 2025, we'll have further capability inserted, and we'll actually start delivering and inserting Block 4 type of capability as well. You may have heard your reference comments made from the US military, and they discussed a Block 4 reimagined. What that would entail is an insertion schedule that's really tied to an executable plan that can be provided by industry so we can avoid these types of disruptions.\nAnd so when you look at it in the short term, could there be pressure on the lot 15 through 17, contract profitability and potential movement around in cash flow? Yes, but I think over the longer term and the medium term, I think we're working in coordination with our customer to make sure that we can deliver the capabilities the customer wants, but on an executable schedule. And if we're able to do that, then we should be able to keep the program on track from a production standpoint.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nI'm sorry, David, good morning from Barclays.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, morning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Morning. Thanks for taking the question. So since Q4, you know, we have a 2024 budget. Looks like we're going to get a, you know, very large supplemental. You won NGI. How might all those things together change how you're thinking about where you kind of fall in, in the revenue guide this year and the potential for revenue growth in 2025 to accelerate kind of off this low single digit level?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, David, as we mentioned for this quarter, we started off pretty solid just on an apples to apples basis. 5% growth in Q1 lines up pretty well with a midpoint guidance range, which is 2% to 2.5%, and the high end of that range being say around 3.5%. So we're well positioned to deliver on that expectation. You know, it is possible, similar to last year, that we could see some upside towards the higher end of the sales guide range there. So, again, really good start that enables that. As we think about 2025, what you saw in the budget, what we're seeing here in a supplemental, gives us higher confidence it will continue to grow.\nWe talked about growth in, you know, starting in 2023, a year earlier than we had originally anticipated, accelerating in 2024, and then giving us more confidence that we'll see at least the same, if not more, growth in 2025. We'll give you, you know, later in the year we'll give you a much better update in terms of what we're seeing. But right now, all this bodes well to our sustained growth in terms of what we've been driving to, not only in 2025, but beyond 2025 as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, Jim and Jay. Jay, on missiles and fire control, can you talk maybe about the confidence in your margin guidance for the year? Just given the Q1 margin performance was certainly the lowest that we've seen in many years. And we know the classified losses are supposed to expected to continue, but you've got kind of this inflecting top line. I think Maria called out all the production increases, and just do the losses just get smaller in the classified, or are we going to see some offsets just because of the higher volume? Maybe you could just give more color on your expectations on the margin performance profile going forward. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, Peter. MFC was a little light because of two factors. First, as we mentioned, we did have the $100 million loss provision that we recorded. In addition to that, their profit adjustments were lighter year-over-year by about $20 million. And so that's a function really of calendarization. We'll see profit adjustments throughout the rest of the year improve. And so getting us back to what we had guided to, just as a reminder, we're anticipating, and that was fully anticipated in our guidance for MFC, that we would have additional or could have additional losses in the back half of the year associated with this classified program.\nAnd so you know, what our guide, what it implies from where we are today, we recorded $100 million is in the range of another $225 million in the back half of the year, which would be provided for in this expectation. Now, going beyond that, you know, we've talked about this and I'll just deal with the question up front in terms of can timing change? It's possible that we could record additional losses here in 2024 depending on other factors as the year goes on. There's factors such as technical milestone achievement through the balance of the year, discussions with our customers, visibility to funding, visibility to funding. So all of those factors go into the determination on whether you have to recognize a loss earlier.\nYou'll see coming out in our 10-Q that we've actually ranged the potential losses on this program, which would be in excess additional losses in excess of $1 billion. So at least you can have an opportunity to size it, the timing of which is still to be determined. We've got about $225 million at least embedded in our guide for the balance of the year.\nGoing back to MFC for the year. If you really take apart their expectation, the impact of this at $325 million of losses in the year anticipated, they're offsetting a fair amount of that in their guide. I mean the impact of that is 270 basis points alone, and their total full year guide is down about 210. And so you're seeing offsetting improvement within MFC. It's not entirely one for one, but their underlying performance has been solid, and we expect that to continue.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nPeter, it's Jim. I used to fly these aircraft for the USAF, and I can assure you that the capability that's being developed here at MFC in a classified program will have very, very long legs. There's going to be many, many years, we believe, of orders to follow. So yeah, for a quarter, for the year, maybe for a couple of years, we're going to absorb the loss provisions that Jay described. But I think if you look under the area, under the curve for the life cycle, it's going to be significantly positive. And so we want to get there as efficiently as we can. This is a long run franchise program that I think the US Government is going to support for a very long time.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRight. I think it's important to keep that in mind. You know, we spent a lot of time talking about timing of losses, things like that, and the magnitude of it. But we also spend a lot of time internally going through just where we are in the progress of the program as well as the business case. And I can assure you the business case is accretive to it at above our cost of capital. And as Jim mentioned, it's going to provide strong returns for many years to come.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI wanted to ask a couple on the Next Generation Interceptor win. I guess one, just how you were able to win, I think ahead of when the original down select was expected. And also whenever there's sort of a big contract like this, we always get questions on potential charges because we've seen some of that happen in the industry. So just your confidence that you've got the cost there sort of side correctly.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo the company made a bet about three years ago to say, okay, we've got a digital transformation program that is going to take the whole company to this model-based engineering system. And that's all the way from requirements acceptance from the government to sustainment years and years down the road.\nWe scoped this before; it's about a $6 billion eight- to 10-year program to convert the entire company to a model-based engineering production sustainment operation. NGI was one of the pathfinder programs picked to implement this because there's no legacy to convert. Right. There's no old blueprints to try to figure out how to make three-dimensional, which is something by the way we are doing for C-130 and other programs right now. But we could get off to the fast start on NGI because it was in this born digital category right from the proposal. We were using these digital technologies, you know, 3D CAD and everything else, and sharing data with the government in that fashion and they were able to receive it. And we could thereby accelerate the schedule and contain the cost of the development and ultimately the production too.\nBut by using these tools, there were three original players in this. One dropped out fairly early. The second was in kind of this final phase, if you will, of down select. We were just ready to go and provided our proposal ahead of schedule. The other player, to my knowledge, provided a proposal also.\nAnd then the government was able to make a decision based on that. But I think because of our speed and our ability to demonstrate manageable cost over time, we won and kind of won early, if you will. I'll let Jay talk more about financials, but what I can assure you is the process of this bid did not require us to dive to the bottom on cost. So Jay, you want to take it from there?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. We're currently performing already under a contract, and that contract will continue. We've talked about this before. We've completed a preliminary design review in September 2023, and we're on track for Critical Design Review in 2025 and under the current contract, as well as building test assets. So that will just continue.\nUnder this down select. As far as pricing and costs, you know, the current contract, because of development contracts, cost plus contract, it's low margin, as you would expect, but nothing again abnormal. As far as future bidding that we provided for future types of contracts, there were various elements or different types of contract structures that the customer asked for. We provided those to the customer, none of which was based on aggressive pricing or bidding. As Jim mentioned, we've talked about this in the past, and we've taken a middle of the road approach to our pricing. And this is no different.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Good morning. With FARA off the table and it looks like the FLRAA program has decent support, how are you thinking about the outlook for the vertical lift business? Where could we see some upside? What other competitions are out there? Yeah, how should we think about that?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So you know, Ron, this is Jim here. As we kind of roll into the 21st century, what our company's trying to do is not just look at things through the programmatic lens, or I'll call it vertical kind of column, but also horizontally through the actual mission, and figure out what technologies can accomplish the mission that will enable our core basic platforms to be successful as well. And that's how we're looking at the rotary business is not just at Sikorsky anymore, it is Sikorsky plus all of Lockheed Martin. Right. And that's one of the reasons we're able to work with US Army, Congress, and the broader US.\ngovernment to increase support for, let's say Black Hawk, for example, in spite of the fact that FARA is being canceled and there's another vertical lift program in the form of FLRAA, which is going to be a tilt rotor. So there are missions that the Black Hawk will be extremely well suited for.\nIn the rotary. It's really the lower air domain. It's not just for rotorcraft. So how do we pair those rotorcraft? A traditional Black Hawk, let's call it, by modernizing the Black Hawk with digital technology to do what the Air Force would call CCA, Collaborative Combat Aircraft, meaning you can, in the lower air domain, tie drones and uncrewed aircraft to a Black Hawk using digital technology. And we've demonstrated that already, you can actually make the Black Hawk itself autonomous with no pilots in it being flown from a command center to do high-risk missions.\nSo we're looking at the mission and saying what can we do all across Lockheed Martin, whether it's through sensor fusion, AI, 5G, space-based sensor assets to make the Black Hawk, for example, a much longer lived platform, a much more relevant platform, and actually a very efficient platform platform compared to say the FLRAA that won't be able to do some of the missions anyway. So we have a strong confidence then in Sikorsky itself and the platforms that it does produce. And that includes CH-53K, which I mentioned, the Seahawk, which is a Black Hawk that's configured for maritime operations. That is pretty high tech as well. And so we feel really solid, as I think Jay said in his remarks on Sikorsky's future, with a backlog of $20 billion and the ability to modernize these really reliable.\nIn production aircraft, to do new things with missions and digital technology and integrate with other parts of LM and our partners to make those platforms relevant in the future. So I'll stop there. Jay, do you have anything else you want to say?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, just a couple of things. As Jim mentioned, a stable outlook is the best way to describe it. As Jim mentioned, CH-53K is really the pillar and those revenues between now and 2027, 2028 are going to double. And so while we will see declines in other programs such as Combat Rescue Helicopter, some declines on Black Hawk, and others, the CH-53K will really offset all those declines. We do have to go through a rebalance, a little bit of a rebalance of the workforce because the mix of development work versus production work is different than what we'd originally anticipated. So we'll go through that. But I think the business as I mentioned will be is pretty stable. We're also, as Jim mentioned, continue to have dialogue and just investments in Black Hawk modernization which will maintain its relevancy, particularly in the JADC2 environment.\nAnd so of course he continues to see opportunities for not only the base missions that Black Hawk performs, but other missions as well. Those dialogues are ongoing with the Army to determine what would be the best fits for those. And so as I mentioned, you know, from a revenue standpoint, over the next five years, it'll actually go up over the next few years a little bit, come back down, but pretty much flat to where it is today. And so stability, I think is the best way to describe it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Spingarn\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. If we put the impact of TR-3 to the side on the last call, you underscored the importance of the supply chain in producing F-35s at a rate of 156. And one of the things that's made the F-35 program so well supported by Congress, international countries is the breadth of this supply chain. But is the complexity and scale of the supply chain limiting the potential and affordability of the program? And on future fighter aircraft programs, whether it be NGAD or F/A-XX, might we expect Lockheed to do more of the work in-house, the production work in-house when compared to F-35?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo it's a great topic, Rob. And so let's start with the origination of the F-35 program. It was intended, as you said, to be a wide-based allied program. I think it was seven literally partners, essentially treaty partners that were going to all get together and contribute their industrial capacity and their financial capacity to this program, given its importance, complexity, and the scale that people were contemplating. So yeah, we have a pretty broad supply chain. There were a couple times when that's gotten a little tough for the program. COVID was one of those. So we had delayed deliveries out of the UK because the factories there weren't open, although ours were. So we will be mitigating any future programs that we have and we, we're eager to have international production and sustainment partners and we're going to expand that.\nBut we're also going to apply some anti-fragility methodologies to those initiatives going forward. No one really thought of COVID of course, but now that we've had that example, we know we need to have second and maybe third sources, and geographic diversity would be a positive thing from that perspective. So we'll just be a little more broadly thoughtful about how we do this. Having single sources outside the US is probably not the best idea. There's an affordability issue around that too. So we're just going to have to balance everything out. So based on its origination and essentially the commitment of the countries to the program, we do have that sort of spread out supply chain with a couple of weak spots in it. Look, another weak spot is canopies, right? How hard is it to make a glass canopy?\nWell, with this kind of stress and the kind of precision that's needed, and putting an F-35 canopy together versus an F-4, which I used to look out of a little bit, highly complex, hard to produce, single source, one of the big degraders that we have. So again, we're going to learn from that whether it's a domestic or international supplier going forward. In addition, as you pointed out, we are heavily insourcing when we can. Lockheed Martin has the best technology. We're looking hard at making sure that we can control as much of the supply chain that is feasible and reasonable based on whatever program it is. So, for example, on NGI, that was at MFC.\nLockheed Martin Space collaboration to make sure that the most critical sensor components that we could produce in the company effectively and efficiently were the ones that were selected. Okay. And so your topic is a really great one. We intend to actually geographically further diversify our supply chain, but really based on this antifragility concept of having two or three sources, either different parts of the world, different companies, different logistical chains, things like that, where we won't run into some supply chain issues as much as we have on some prior programs, including F-35, honestly.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Rob Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nJim. Last quarter you had some comments on contract structures and the way perhaps your customers have been dealing with defense industry in recent years. I was wondering if there's been any? Sort of resonance from your commentary and any willingness, early willingness from the customer to look at this in a fresh way.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo let me focus on digital. Service contracting, because I think that's a really ripe opportunity area for the DoD to work with industry, not just the traditional defense primes, if you will, but broader industry too. We want to play on subscription basis ourselves. We want to bring in partners that will only be our suppliers on a subscription basis. So, in terms of, say, 5G connectivity services, backhaul, those kinds of things, AI, which needs constant refreshing and modeling. We will do a lot of the AI in house, but we're not going to be possible to do all of it. We want to bring in partners. We announced a couple of them, like NVIDIA and IBM. They want to work with us. So, I do think we're starting to get interest inside government on how to do this.\nWe proposed, frankly, ourselves, which will open up opportunity for a lot of other companies in different sectors, an adjacent acquisition process within the DoD for digital services. Alongside the traditional DoD acquisition process for largely physical goods like aircraft, ships, et cetera, there's interest in that. We haven't gotten it over the line, so to speak, but I think there's a lot of advocacy across broad industry to do that, and starting to be in Congress and other places, and DoD as well. Along with that, we want to drive an open architecture system so that US government has a lot of diversity in its potential suppliers because we're all working off of the same standards base as far as APIs, interfaces, frequencies used, and those kinds of things, and synchronize that as much as we can with commercial industries so we can use more of their IP, and more of their resources, and more of their people. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here, and we're starting to get some traction on it.\nBut it's going to take a little bit of time to get those processes and those standards bodies put in place. But we're actually on it and we have some partners and teammates that agree with us.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nI'll just add, Rob, we have seen some changes where the contract structure is more closely aligned with the capability that's being requested and the assessment of the technology maturation of that capability. So, you know, you're not seeing as many of these kind of high risk fixed price development contracts that really don't work well for anybody because they don't optimize a solution and they typically end up poorly for the contractor. We have seen those changes. You know, again, they're case by case. But I can tell you that at least what we're seeing, particularly in the higher risk, higher technology type risk arenas, we are seeing a shift in contracting to contracting vehicles that are just more relevant to those circumstances.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, and Rob, maybe to support just another minute what Jay is speaking about in a more direct way here. I have a view, as you may have heard, that having even a cost-based development project or program with a fixed price set of early production options is a tough thing to intellectually get at least my arms around, which is committing to cost and price.\nOn an object that really hasn't been fully invented yet. We're short, you know, we're looking really, really hard if that's at any opportunity that's presented to us in that context as a company. So that is one area where, again, highlight what Jay is speaking about, more of an alignment of what can industry deliver on a reasonable risk basis. And so the government can get a successful program out of it, frankly, and not have massive write-offs in industry, or cost overruns, or long schedule delays. We think it's constructive to get some more of that alignment that Jay described.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nAnalyst, Shapiro Research\n\nYes, good morning. A couple quick ones for you, Jay. If the first quarter normalized growth was. 5% and even at the high end you're looking for 3.5%, so will this? Be the fastest growing quarter and what. Slows down, and I'm obviously normalizing for the fourth quarter. And then the second question is the. Guidance for other net was $400 million. Q1 is only -$61 million. I was expecting you might lower that number for the year. What was the reason why you didn't lower it?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content2": "All right, George, thank you. On the quarterly profile for sales, as you mentioned, Craig, on a normalized basis, 5% growth here in the first quarter, you know, I'd see it will slow down to low single digit in the second and third. We're thinking that the fourth quarter probably flattish to maybe slightly down. You might recall that the fourth quarter of 2023 ended up being stronger than we were originally expecting. So our compare in the fourth quarter of this year would be a little bit tougher. So, you know, you're talking in second and third quarters probably 2% to 3% type of growth numbers with a flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As far as other net, you know George, you got me there. There's probably some opportunity in there.\nYou know, we'll calibrate that and we'll update the guide in the second quarter for the full year. But it's probably more prudent to just wait till we're halfway through the year and just, just make an assessment of the entire outlook and we'll just leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYou've talked about Pentagon terms of trade and contract structure here, and you mentioned NGI as cost-plus development. But you also mentioned they asked to kind of see multiple contract structures. Curious what they asked to see, where you landed on those maybe interim windows between development and production. And then Jay, the loss-making classified program and MFC, what year do you expect that to be profitable on an annual basis? And just to confirm, there's one program. In that position, correct? Not more than one?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, that's correct. No, just one program. You know, I think right now our outlook would say probably in 2020 is where we would expect that to flip to positive. Again, it's a question of the timing of the recognition of the losses. But if you assume kind of more linear approach from here on out, it'll be about 2028. As far as NGI, just again the different contracting vehicles are ranging anywhere from cost-plus to fixed-price incentive. There's no, the customer hasn't selected exactly which vehicle wants to pursue. So there's nothing actually under contract for the next phase or phases right now. We're going to continue to perform under the current contract. As I mentioned, we got Critical Design Review in 2025. Also, as part of this contract, we have to provide some test assets. Between now and then I'm sure we'll have discussions in terms of getting future phases on contract.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. And Noah, the principle behind what Jay and I are speaking to here is that. We want to be agnostic, ultimately from a risk-adjusted basis, on whatever contract format that the government would like to employ in these matters. So if it's going to be any kind of, I'll say, a highest risk would be again fixed-price production on something that's not been designed yet. We will put a high-risk premium in the future and have on those kinds of requests of the government.\nAnd what's interesting is they're asking for multiple types on NGI, and that's going to give them an opportunity to see what, what contract risk transfer to industry is now going to cost, at least in Lockheed Martin's case, because we will reply on that basis to say if you want us to have this kind of contract, we have to have a risk premium that's significantly higher than just say a pure cost based contract to give you the greatest contrast. And that's just the principle we're going to use from now on. So if you want a certain price point as government, we will provide you a contract format that will get you that price. But if you want to shift more risk to industry, you'll see a higher risk premium come back in our proposal, if you will. So that's the principle we're using and that we'll continue to use.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Lockheed Martin\n\nLois, I think we have time for one more question since we're close to the top of the hour. Let's take one more and then we'll be done.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And that question will come from Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nGood morning. Thanks. Two-part quick, two-part question on C2BMC. I want to know if you could discuss the P&L impact in terms of timing and margins. Second, and more broadly, I thought you might discuss a bit about how this fits with your strategy for pulling IAMD-centric programs and what the opportunity set there is.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay for timing. We've been under contract; this is a follow-on for us. And what I could do, Rich, is I don't recall offhand exactly what the annual revenues are, but I could have Maria follow up with you. But this again is just a continuation of those activities there. So no significant change, I don't think, from a revenue standpoint or margin expectation.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAt RMS for this. From the mission-centric approach, this is actually a pretty good example of that, rich in pulling through or extending existing programs. Right. What we're trying to show is that. You can map data flows through a full mission, right, which generally includes, and now cyber, by the way, up front. So you have a cyber track, then you have to have a sensing capability. You then have to have a way to get sensor data, whether it comes from a satellite or a submarine, back into the command and control system. Along with that, you have to have targeting and tracking quality data that comes from beyond just the sensing of an object that's a target. You have to be able to track the target in a way that you can then guide a projectile to it.\nTake it out, or put a cyber attack against it, or a laser, or whatever the effector will be. So the term of art for that is not pretty. It's called a kill chain. We want to put these chains together in diverse ways that are again antifragile, which means if you take out one link in that chain.\nYou don't eliminate your ability to complete the mission. And so that's where we're looking at data flows in addition to physical flows, if you will. Right. And if we can help create an open architecture system that can provide multiple routes of data flows that can affect missions, then we will be able to have kind of a head start on our platforms in designing to those. And that's what we're doing with Black Hawk, for that's what we're doing using the C2BMC system. The LRDR radar, and ultimately the NGI missile will be based on a similar architecture. We'd like that architecture to be common outside of Lockheed Martin as well as inside, because that'll open up more suppliers to us and also provide the government more competitive options. So this is all coming together, and I'm kind of glad you asked the question here at the end because it's very intentional.\nOkay, thanks, Maria. Thanks, everybody on the call. I want to also express my appreciation to everybody at Lockheed Martin for their relentless focus on this operational execution I mentioned, and driving innovation and excellence. We're all doing this in support of our customers. That's the reason we have a vision for 21st Century Security that we think will keep deterrence high in an increasingly complex and threatening global environment. As a company, we have strong backlog, as you heard. We're driving operating discipline across the whole organization in this continuous improvement mindset we have. So all that's designed to position our company for you as shareholders for future growth, and attractive and reliable returns to shareholders over a long period of time. So, thank you all again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Lois, that concludes our call. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.\nGood day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q1 2024 earnings call. I'd like to begin today's discussion with a brief overview of our quarterly financial results, the state of the US Department of Defense budget, status updates on some key programs, and recent advancements made to support our vision of 21st Century Security that integrates the latest digital technologies. Then Jay and Maria will provide more detailed information about quarterly highlights and financials.\nThe increasingly unstable geopolitical environment in the world today makes it essential for industry and government to strengthen our nation's capabilities to deter and defend against further aggressive behavior against the US and our allies. We here at Lockheed Martin are continuing to invest heavily to improve our design and production capabilities while actively partnering with leading companies inside and outside the A and D industry to incorporate a wide range of technologies. As a result, we delivered robust revenue growth across the company, and we maintained a robust backlog of $159 billion, reflecting alignment between our advanced technology solutions and our customers' key missions and priorities. These Q1 results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full-year financial expectations we shared in the most recent earnings call.\nMoreover, the approved FY2024 defense budget reflected many positives for Lockheed Martin, consistent with national defense strategy priorities too. Highlights include robust funding for munitions, multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter, the Fleet Ballistic Missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission including F-35 aircraft, C-130s, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M, and others, in addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, GMLRS, and PAC-3, as well as hypersonic Conventional Prompt Strike and the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. In addition to that, next-generation interceptors getting support, which I'll address more in a moment.\nThis week, funding of $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel, and Indo-Pacific security supplementals passed the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate. We expect FY2025 presidential budget request and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company, giving us further confidence in our long range plan.\nWhile demand for these key programs remains elevated, it is also essential that our program performance in terms of quality, safety, cost, and schedule gets and stays at the highest level on our most significant programs. I, Jay, and my senior executive team are personally and directly involved on the F-35. We remain focused on program execution in terms of concurrent development, production, and sustainment, and we are bringing all relevant resources across our company and collaborating closely with our customers and suppliers to fully implement the TR-3 capabilities that everybody's looking forward to. Getting.\nThese capabilities based on the new core processor, data storage unit, and pilot display will ensure that the F-35 is not only the most capable and effective fighter aircraft in the world, but it will also further advance its abilities to act as the air domain quarterback of joint all domain operations for the US and its allies. We're encouraged by the solid progress made over the last few months towards resuming deliveries, including improvement in aircraft mission system capabilities, system stability, as we advance from prior software versions toward the combat training capable configuration. Flight testing of this configuration is now underway and we're on a path we expect to be on with regard to maturing the system with approximately 95% of TR-3 capabilities in this flight test program.\nThe test results to date support our expected timeline of delivering the first TR-3 combat training capable aircraft in Q3 and then transition to a fully combat capable aircraft in 2025 as planned. There will be continual software updates to support further capability insertions over the Block 4 program and beyond. While there were no final deliveries of F-35 jets in Q1, we're maintaining our production rate and continue to expect an aircraft delivery range for 2024 and between 75 and 110, which requires timely receipt of the necessary hardware from TR-3 suppliers along the way. The F-35's advanced combat and interoperability capabilities continue to create strong demand for the aircraft internationally too. In the quarter, the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team with a signed letter of offer and acceptance, making it official its intent to procure 24 F-35s.\nIn addition, the US Department of State approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35s, and Singapore announced its intent to purchase 8 F-35s to complement the 12 F-35Bs to which it has already previously committed. Also in the lower air domain, while we're disappointed in the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Program, or FARA, Sikorsky remains committed to delivering innovative and reliable aviation capabilities to our domestic and global customers. With a strong foundation of more than $20 billion in backlog, bolstered by expected and funded growth in the heavy-lift CH-53K helicopter program, Sikorsky's multi-year outlook is stable. We're also encouraged by the Army's renewed commitment to Black Hawk production and modernization, as well as our ability to address mission gaps with capability upgrades that leverage Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio of solutions. In the lower air domain, things such as autonomy, AI, et cetera. Turning now to missile defense missions, which, given recent world events, are becoming more critical than ever, we continue to lead the industry.\nLast week the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, selected Lockheed Martin to deliver the new Homeland Missile Defense capability for the United States, which is called the Next Generation Interceptor or NGI. As the MDA's NGI prime contractor, Lockheed Martin will provide the most modern, reliable, and technically advanced interceptor in the history of this system.\nThis program was 1LMX. That's our digital transformation born digital program, meaning we embraced model-based engineering, digital tools, processes, and technologies from the very, very start of this program. Now as it continues on its path of the Critical Design Review, integration with broader weapons system and flight tests, I'm proud of the Lockheed Martin team that enabled all of this. We were MDA's early down select before it was even on their schedule because we're so far in front to get this essential homeland defense capability off to a fast start.\nEarlier this quarter, the Long Range Discrimination Radar, or LRDR, completed final acceptance and was officially handed over to the Missile Defense Agency in preparation for an operational capability baseline decision. What that means is final transition to active service for that radar to help defend the country. The LRDR is a cutting-edge national asset, providing the benefits of both low- and high-frequency radars to search, track, and discriminate incoming missiles with an open system approach, enabling the customer to add incremental capabilities such as hypersonic defense. This is located up in Alaska, the prime location where we can sense early what any attack might look like and respond to it. What that really does though is create an elevated deterrence to any kind of attack like that. So it's really great that LRDR about ready to go online now.\nBoth NGI and LRDR will be critical elements within the overall homeland defense mission, and they're going to be integrated into the broader defense architecture with a battle management system we call command control, battle management, and communications, or as the military calls it, C2BMC. So that's the system that's going to be used to integrate the radars, the missiles, and allow us to defend the country. In April, Lockheed Martin was selected for a potential 10-year $4 billion follow-on C2BMC next generation contract with the MDA, demonstrating again our leadership position in battle management systems for homeland defense. Under this contract, we'll continue to modernize and expand the system's capabilities to enhance global integration, improve space domain awareness, and optimize sensor connectivity and data fusion to levels never done before.\nAll of which will create the most complete picture of these incoming threats, as I just spoke about a minute ago. Separately, we also continue to advance our 21st Century Security solution through collaboration with strategic commercial partners across the tech, telecom, microprocessor, and other industries to support the national defense.\nCiting just one example, we announced Lockheed Martin will work with Intel to support the Simulated Transition for Advanced Microelectronics Packaging, or STAMP, program for the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This CHIPS Act-related collaboration will provide a revolutionary leap in defense systems capabilities using high-performance US-built semiconductors. Over the next 18 months, we'll integrate our latest Sensor Open Systems Architecture technology with Intel semiconductors with the intent to ultimately implement, test, and complete production through the US Navy's Lockheed Martin MH-60 Romeo helicopter program. I'll now turn it over to Jay for award highlights and some additional commentary on our financial results.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nJay, thanks, Jim. I'll cover the consolidated results and touch on some additional highlights before handing it off to Maria, who will discuss the core quarterly financials by business area, and then I'll come back to discuss the outlook and close out the remarks. Starting with Chart 4, we had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales of $17.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year led by MFC and RMS. While the results benefited from an extra calendar week compared to 2023, normalized year-over-year sales growth was a solid 5%. We saw strong labor and material throughput indicative of an improving supply chain. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to enhance quality and performance proactively and, as needed, expand the breadth and depth of our engagement at supplier locations.\nSegment operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% year-over-year, with margins of 10.1%, and included the anticipated $100 million reach forward loss associated with the classified missile program at MFC. Excluding this charge, Lockheed Martin segment margins were 10.7%, primarily reflecting year-over-year lower profit adjustments. GAAP earnings per share of $6.39 were down 3% as year-over-year benefits from higher profit and lower share count were more than offset by higher interest expense, lower pension income, and mark to market gains. Book-to-bill in Q1 was just below 1. Notably, space booked several large national security orders in the quarter, including SDA Tracking Layer and other significant classified awards, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 and record backlog of $33 billion. At space.\nWe generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter after investing $360 million in research and development, and $380 million in capital expenditures. Share repurchases were $1 billion, and we returned $780 million through our dividend.\nShifting over to additional highlights in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making on the F-16 program. The first three F-16 Block 70 jets ferried from Greenville, South Carolina to Bahrain in March. To date, Lockheed Martin has produced five F-16 Block 70 jets for Bahrain with additional 11 in various stages of production and testing. We also presented the first two F-16 Block 70 aircraft to Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, underscoring the deepening partnership between the two countries. In addition, the State Department notified Congress of authorization of the sale of 40 F-16s and related upgrades and support to Turkey. The latest deal builds on our long relationship and history with Turkish Air Force. We are confident the F-16 Block 70 and Viper upgrade package provide advanced 21st century security capabilities with affordable operating and life cycle costs for Turkey.\nWe also continue to upgrade our weapon systems for longer range standoff capability. In February, in the US, the extended-range ER variant of the GMLRS Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System achieved success in its first operational test. The US Army fired two unitary-warhead ER GMLRS variants with a HIMARS launcher, demonstrating precision and advancing this capability closer to production. The US Army also awarded Lockheed Martin the fourth production contract for early-operating-capability Precision Strike Missiles, known as PrSM. This award will allow for a significant increase in production quantities to meet Army demand for long-range surface-to-surface missiles and the hypersonics. Following the recent end-to-end flight test, we completed the test program of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, with full confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. We have demonstrated successful all-up-round end-to-end performance on multiple occasions.\nARRW provides the US with the earliest air-launch, fully qualified, production-ready supersonic solution. Hypersonic solution, I'm sorry, and Lockheed Martin is prepared to quickly deliver additional tactical, operational, and leave-behind hypersonic strike assets that can be rapidly deployed to the US military. We also continue to advance hypersonic strike capability in the land and sea domains through the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon and Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Both solutions have a full year of milestones ahead as we progress towards operational capability. Shifting to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense arena, the Aegis Weapon System successfully executed one of the most complicated ballistic missile defense tests in Q1 when the system tracked and intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile amidst multiple decoys.\nThe test employed the latest updates to the system and demonstrates the reliability of Aegis to operate in a dynamic threat environment, and we're constantly evolving the Aegis system. This quarter, we made further progress on our efforts to integrate with PAC3 to enable an affordable, combat-proven IAMD capability for maritime engagements and expand the mission capability of our systems. I'll pause here and let me turn it over to Maria to cover the business areas.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks Jay. Today I will discuss first quarter year-over-year results for the business areas, starting with aeronautics. On Chart 5, first quarter sales at Aeronautics were over $6.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and that's 1% normalized for the extra week in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and Skunk Works and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit is comparable year-over-year with higher volume being offset by lower margin development contract mix and lower net profit adjustments. Mainly on the F-35, aeronautics backlog remains at a healthy $57 billion which includes 373 F-35s, 80 C-130Js, and 132 F-16s supporting growth into 2025 and beyond.\nTurning to missiles and fire control on chart 6, sales increased 25% from the prior year, 16% normalized for the extra week, driven by production ramps on tactical and strike missile programs, primarily GMLRS, HIMARS, and JASSM. LRASM Integrated Air and Missile Defense also saw higher volume on PAC3 and THAAD. As expected, segment operating profit decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the $100 million loss on the classified program Jay mentioned previously. Normalizing for the loss, MFC's margins would have been 13.7%. Now I'd like to provide a quick update on our annual production capacity plans for key programs. PAC3 is currently at 500 missiles, growing to 550 in 2025 and 650 by 2027. GMLRS currently is at 10,000 missiles, growing to 14,000 by 2025. JASSM, LRASM currently at about 650 missiles, growing to 1,100 by 2026, and HIMARS currently at 72 launchers growing to 96.\nNext year. Shifting to Rotary and Mission Systems. On Chart 7, sales increased 16% in the quarter, 8% normalized for the extra week, driven by higher volume across the entire portfolio, including radar and laser programs within Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors, various programs within C6ISR, and the CH-53K and Seahawk programs within Sikorsky. Operating profit increased 23% due to higher volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit adjustments. Finally, with Space on Chart 8, sales increased 10% year-over-year, 2% normalized for the extra week to approximately $3.3 billion. The growth was driven by higher volume on the Fleet Ballistic Missile program and ramp-ups on hypersonic and Next Generation Interceptor programs within Strategic and Missile Defense, as well as higher volume on Space Development Agency transport and tracking layer programs within National Security Space.\nOperating profit increased 16% compared to Q1 2023, driven by higher volume in ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower net profit adjustments primarily on the Next Gen OPIR program. Now I'll turn it back to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria, let's turn to the outlook on Chart 9. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we said in January, with the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve the consolidated full year outlook. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $6 to 6.3 billion, including over $3 billion of independent research and development, and capital investments, while the dividend along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases support our return to shareholders, targeting a mid single digit free cash flow per share growth over the longer term. All right, to close out and summarize on Chart 10, we're off to a solid start in 2024 and remain laser focused on execution to our customer and programmatic commitments while building momentum towards delivering our full year guidance through our One LMX transformation.\nWe are reengineering our internal processes by providing the automations and capabilities needed to drive efficiency, increase velocity, and enhance key captures and programs. 1LMX will enable us to combine the depth and breadth of our portfolio with the expertise and dedication of our people to drive 21st Century Security solutions for our customers and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And if you wish to ask a question, please press one then zero. On your touchtone phone you will hear an annunciator indicating that you've been placed into queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing 1 0 again. If you're using a speakerphone or Bluetooth, please pick up your handset before pressing the number once again. If you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. Our first question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nMorning.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nI'd like to start to make sure we have a good understanding of the F-35 and right now with TR-3. As you said, the Air Force has talked about this as well, and it looks like that timelines move back to some point in Q3, and there's just been a great deal of slippage in the timeline over the last few years. Block 4 has been delayed, and the new budget has cut deliveries in 2020, 2025, and 2026, ostensibly to avoid having to do later Block 4 upgrades. Now you've been able to keep production and revenues up, although deliveries and cash payments are off. But how can we get confident in the trajectory?\nPerhaps, Jim, maybe you could talk about what a positive or more negative scenario might look like for production and deliveries over the next two years and what it would mean for the revenue and cash trajectory?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, Doug. So I think it's important to understand that we're doing, as I said earlier, concurrent development and production, and then advancing the sustainment capability as well, all at the same time. Most of these complex programs go through a period of development and then a production run largely off of that design base or that engineered base of what the aircraft's supposed to look like and how it's going to perform. The F-35 is different in a sense. That development's been going on since the day the program started years and years ago, and it's going on today. Now, the good news about that is you have step function increases in capability every few years. And as a result of the F-35's capacity to do that, the government just came out and extended the expected service life of the aircraft another decade or two, I think it was.\nSo this is a good thing, but it's also extremely difficult thing to do and even to predict schedule, right? It's our responsibility to hold cost and schedule, but we don't control all the variables, let me just say, and that's okay. We're still the OEM, we're still responsible. And so what we've run into on TR3 is just the level of complexity and executing the step function increase.\nThat's pretty. I'd say, novel or dramatic. What the team is doing at our company is we're integrating a series of components, devices, software, and managing and integrating all of that. And so what's happening now is we are ringing out all the.\nSoftware through all of the new hardware and integrating it into all the aircraft other systems. And that's taken longer than our team predicted. The way we're going to get at that is you think of it as a release one and a release two, and we've got a lot of confidence in this stage. Doug, Release one, if you can think of it that way, is what we're calling along with the US Government a combat training capable aircraft, meaning we can get these jets in the hands of squadron, wing and.\nRegional commanders so that they can start training their pilots on them and training their maintenance organizations and also getting their bases and infrastructure, spare parts, pools, and everything else sort of in operational shape, if you will. Once we get the final software load for the fully combat capable version of TR3 sometime in the next few months, then those aircraft could be deployed into actual combat operations. And you'll have the training, the maintenance, the ringing out, the operational.\nPatterns and procedures on how to actually fly the jet in combat. So we'd like to be able to do it sooner, but this is the schedule we're on. And I'd say for the combat training capable aircraft, we're highly confident based on the test results so far, that those will be deliverable in the third quarter. Jay, you want to say anything else about cash flow?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, sure, Doug. I'll just add, as Jim mentioned, this combat training capable capability and configuration, as Jim mentioned, supports the training of the squadrons, standing up to new squadrons, and decreasing the amount of time the aircraft are parked. All that. What that does is really avoids any type of significant disruption. So what this does is really keep our production on track here in 2024 and then beyond as well, as Jim mentioned, in 2025, we'll have further capability inserted and we'll actually start delivering and inserting Block 4 type of capability as well. And you may have heard your reference comments made from the US military and they discussed a Block 4 reimagined and what that would entail is an insertion schedule that's really tied to an executable plan that can be provided by industry so we can avoid these types of disruptions.\nAnd so when you look at it in the short term, could there be pressure on the lot 15 through 17, contract profitability and potential movement around in cash flow? Yes, but I think over the longer term and the medium term, I think we're working in coordination with our customer to make sure that we can deliver the capabilities the customer wants, but on an executable schedule. And if we're able to do that, then we should be able to keep the program on track from a production standpoint.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nI'm sorry, David, good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, morning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Morning. Thanks for taking the question. So since Q4, you know, we have a 2024 budget. Looks like we're going to get a, you know, very large supplemental. You won NGI. How might all those things together change how you're thinking about where you kind of fall in the revenue guide this year and the potential for revenue growth in 2025 to accelerate kind of off this low single digit level.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, David, as we mentioned for this quarter, we started off pretty solid just on an apples to apples basis. 5% growth in the first quarter lines up pretty well with a midpoint guidance range, which is 2% to 2.5%, and the high end of that range being say around 3.5%. So we're well positioned to deliver on that expectation. You know, it is possible, similar to last year, that we could see some upside towards the higher end of the sales guide range there. So again, really good start that enables that. As we think about 2025, what you saw in the budget, what we're seeing here in a supplemental gives us higher confidence it will continue to grow. We talked about growth, you know, starting in 2023, a year earlier than we had originally anticipated, accelerating in 2024.\nIn giving us more confidence that we'll see at least the same, if not more growth in 2025, we'll give you, you know, later in the year we'll give you a much better update in terms of what we're seeing. Right now all this bodes well to our sustained growth in terms of what we've been driving to not only in 25, but beyond 25 as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, Jim and Jay. Hey, Jay. On missiles and fire control, can you talk maybe about the confidence in your margin guidance for the year? Just given the Q1 margin performance was certainly the lowest that we've seen in many years. And we know the classified losses are supposed to expected to continue, but you've got kind of this inflecting top line. I think Maria called out all the production increases, and just do the losses just get smaller in the classified, or are we going to see some offsets just because of the higher volume? Maybe you could just give more color on your expectations on the margin performance profile going forward. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, Peter. MFC was a little light because of two factors. First, as we mentioned, we did have the $100 million loss provision that we recorded. In addition to that, their profit adjustments were lighter year-over-year by about $20 million. And so that's a function really of calendarization. We'll see profit adjustments throughout the rest of the year improve. And so, getting us back to what we had guided to, just as a reminder, we're anticipating, and that was fully anticipated in our guidance for MFC, that we would have additional or could have additional losses in the back half of the year associated with this classified program.\nAnd so, you know, what our guide, what it implies from where we are today, we recorded $100 million, is in the range of another $225 million in the back half of the year, which would be provided for in this expectation. Now, going beyond that, you know, we've talked about this, and I'll just deal with the question up front in terms of, can timing change, and it's possible that we could record additional losses here in 2024 depending on other factors as the year goes on. There's factors such as technical milestone achievement through the balance of the year, discussions with our customers, visibility to funding, visibility to funding.\nSo all of those factors go into the determination and whether you have to recognize a loss or earlier, you'll see coming out in our 10-Q that we've actually ranged the potential losses on this program which would be in excess additional losses in excess of a billion dollars. So at least you could have an opportunity to size it. The timing of which is still to be determined. We've got about $225 million at least embedded in our guide for the balance of the year.\nGoing back to MFC for the year. If you really take apart their expectation, the impact of this at $325 million of losses in the year anticipated, they're offsetting a fair amount of that in their guide. I mean the impact of that is 270 basis points alone, and their total full year guide is down about 210. And so you're seeing offsetting improvement within MFC. It's not entirely one for one, but their underlying performance has been solid, and we expect that to continue.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAnd Peter, it's Jim. I used to fly these aircraft for the USAF, and I can assure you that the capability that's being developed here at MFC in the classified program will have very, very long legs. There's going to be many, many years, we believe, of orders to follow. So yeah, for a quarter, for the year, maybe for a couple of years, we're going to absorb the loss provisions that Jay described. But I think if you look under the area under the curve for the life cycle, it's going to be significantly positive. And so we want to get there as efficiently as we can. This is a long run franchise program that I think the US Government is going to support for a very long time.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRight. I think it's important to keep that in mind. You know, we spent a lot of time talking about timing of losses and things like that and the magnitude of it. But we also spend a lot of time internally going through just where we are in the progress of the program as well as the business case. And I can assure you the business case is accretive to it at a above our cost of capital. And as Jim mentioned, it's going to provide strong returns for many years to come.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI wanted to ask a couple on the NextGen Interceptor win, I guess, you know, one just how you were able to win, I think, ahead of when the original down select was expected. Then also, you know, whenever there's sort of a big contract like this and we always get questions on potential charges because we've seen some of that happen in the industry. So just your confidence that you've got the cost there sort of sized correctly.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo the company made a bet about three years ago to say, okay, we've got a digital transformation program that is going to take the whole company to this model-based engineering system and that's all the way from requirements acceptance from the government to sustainment years and years down the road.\nWe've scoped this before, it's about a $6 billion eight- to 10-year program to convert the entire company to a model-based engineering production, sustainment, operation. NGI was one of the pathfinder programs picked to implement this because there's no legacy to convert. Right. There's no old blueprints to try to figure out how to make three-dimensional, which is something by the way we are doing for C-130 and other programs right now. But we could get off to the fast start on NGI because it was in this born digital category right from the proposal. We were using these digital technologies, 3D CAD and everything else, and sharing data with the government in that fashion and they were able to receive it. And we could thereby accelerate the schedule and contain the cost of the development and ultimately the production too by using these tools.\nThere were three original players in this. One dropped out fairly early. The second was in kind of this final phase, if you will, of down select and we were just ready to go and provided our proposal ahead of schedule. The other player, to my knowledge, provided a proposal also.\nAnd then the government was able to make a decision based on that. But I think, because of our speed and our ability to demonstrate manageable cost over time, we won and kind of won early, if you will. I'll let Jay talk more about financials, but what I can assure you is the process of this bid did not require us to dive to the bottom on cost. So Jay, you want to take it from there?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. We're currently performing already under a contract, and that contract will continue. We've talked about this before. We've completed a preliminary design review in September of 2023, and we're on track for critical design review in 2025 and under the current contract as well as building test assets. So that will just continue.\nUnder this down select. As far as pricing and costs, you know, the current contract, because of the development contract, cost-plus contract, it's low-margin, as you would expect, but nothing again abnormal. As far as future bidding that we provided for future types of contracts, there were various elements or different types of contract structures that the customer asked for. We provided those to the customer, none of which was based on aggressive pricing or bidding. As Jim mentioned, we've talked about this in the past, and we've taken a middle-of-the-road approach to our pricing, and this is no different.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nWith FARA off the table and it looks like the FLRAA program has decent support, how are you thinking about the outlook for the vertical lift business? Where could we see some upside? What other competitions are out there? Yeah, absolutely. Think about that.\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So you know, Ron, this is Jim here. As we kind of roll into the 21st century, what our company's trying to do is not just look at things through the programmatic lens or the, I'll call it vertical kind of column, but, but also horizontally through the actual mission and figure out what technologies can accomplish the mission that will enable our core basic platforms to be successful as well. And that's how we're looking at the rotary business is not just at Sikorsky anymore, it is Sikorsky plus all of Lockheed Martin. Right. And that's one of the reasons we're able to work with US Army, Congress, and the broader US.\ngovernment to increase support for, let's say, Black Hawk, for example, in spite of the fact that FARA is being canceled and there's another vertical lift program in the form of FLRAA, which is going to be a tilt rotor. So there are missions that the Black Hawk will be extremely well suited for.\nIn the rotary lower. It's really the lower air domain. It's not just for rotorcraft. So how do we pair those rotorcraft? A traditional Black Hawk, let's call it, by modernizing the Black Hawk with digital technology to do what the Air Force would call CCA, collaborative combat aircraft, meaning you can in the lower air domain tie drones and uncrewed aircraft to a Black Hawk using digital technology. And we've demonstrated that already. You can actually make the Black Hawk itself autonomous with no pilots in it being flown from a command center to do high risk missions.\nSo we're looking at the mission and saying what can we do all across Lockheed Martin, whether it's through sensor fusion, AI, 5G, space-based sensor assets to make the Black Hawk, for example, a much longer-lived platform, a much more relevant platform, and actually a very efficient platform compared to say the FLRAA aircraft that won't be able to do some of the missions anyway. So we have a strong confidence then in Sikorsky itself and the platforms that it does produce. And that includes CH-53K, which I mentioned, the Seahawk, which is a Black Hawk that's configured for maritime operations. That is pretty high-tech as well. And so we feel really solid, as Jay said in his remarks on Sikorsky's future with a backlog of $20 billion and the ability to modernize these really reliable.\nIn production aircraft to do new things with missions and digital technology, and integrate with other parts of LM and our partners to make those platforms relevant in the future. So I'll stop there. Jay, do you have anything else you want to say?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, just a couple of things. As Jim mentioned, a stable outlook is the best way to describe it. As Jim mentioned, CH-53K is really the pillar. And those revenues between now and 2027, 2028 are going to double. And so while we will see declines in other programs such as Combat Rescue Helicopter, some declines on Black Hawk and others, the CH-53K will really offset all of those declines. We do have to go through a rebalance, a little bit of a rebalance of the workforce because the mix of development work versus production work is different than what we'd originally anticipated. So we'll go through that. But I think the business, as I mentioned, is pretty stable. We're also, as Jim mentioned, continue to have dialogue and just investments in Black Hawk modernization which will maintain its relevancy, particularly in the JADC2 environment.\nAnd so of course he continues to see opportunities for not only the base missions that Black Hawk performs, but other missions as well. Those dialogues are ongoing with the Army to determine what would be the best fits for those. And so as I mentioned, from a revenue standpoint, over the next five years, it'll actually go up over the next few years a little bit, come back down, but pretty much flat to where it is today. And so stability, I think is the best way to describe it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Spingarn\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. If we put the impact of TR-3 to the side on the last call, you underscored the importance of the supply chain in producing F-35s at a rate of 156. One of the things that's made the F-35 program so well supported by Congress and international countries is the breadth of this supply chain. But is the complexity and scale of the supply chain limiting the potential and affordability of the program? On future fighter aircraft programs, whether it be NGAD or F/A-XX, might we expect Lockheed to do more of the work in house, the production work in house when compared to F-35?\n\nJames Taiclet\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content3": "So it's a great topic, Rob. And so let's start with the origination of the F-35 program. It was intended, as you said, to be a wide based allied program. I think it was seven, literally partners, essentially treaty partners that were going to all get together and contribute their industrial capacity and their financial capacity to this program, given its importance, complexity, and the scale that people are contemplating. So yeah, we have a pretty broad supply chain. There were a couple times when that's gotten a little tough for the program. COVID was one of those. So we had delayed deliveries out of the UK because the factories there weren't open, although ours were. So we will be mitigating any future programs that we have and we're eager to have international production and sustainment partners and we're going to expand that.\nBut we're also going to apply some anti-fragility methodologies to those initiatives going forward. No one really thought of COVID of course, but now that we've had that example, we know we need to have second and maybe third sources. And geographic diversity would be a positive thing from that perspective. So we'll just be a little more broadly thoughtful about how we do this. Having single sources outside the US is probably not the best idea. There's an affordability issue around that too. So we're just going to have to balance everything out. So based on its origination and essentially the commitment of the countries to the program, we do have that sort of spread out supply chain with a couple of weak spots in it. Look, another weak spot is canopies. Right. How hard is it to make a glass canopy?\nWell, with this kind of stress and the kind of. Precision that's needed, and putting an F-35 canopy together versus an F-4, which I used to look out of a little bit, highly complex, hard to produce, single source, one of the big degraders that we have. So again, we're going to learn from that whether it's a domestic or international supplier going forward. In addition, as you pointed out, we are heavily insourcing when we can, and Lockheed Martin has the best technology. We're looking hard at making sure that we can control as much of the supply chain that is feasible and reasonable based on whatever program it is. And so, for example, on NGI, that was at MSC.\nLockheed Martin Space collaboration to make sure that the most critical sensor components that we could produce in the company effectively and efficiently were the ones that were selected. Okay, and so your topic is a really great one. We intend to actually geographically.\nFurther diversify our supply chain, but really based on this antifragility concept of having two or three sources, either different parts of the world, different companies, different logistical chains, things like that, where we won't run into some supply chain issues as much as we have on some prior programs, including F-35, honestly."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century Security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders. Turning to Chart 3, robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems, and other products, services, and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion.\nFull year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year over year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55.\nTo position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development and capital. In 2023, we generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid single digits. We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders, over $9 billion, through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook include low single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base, at a range of $6 to 6.3 billion of free cash flow.\nOur ongoing dividends and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024.\nWe also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century Security in the year, and as we believe that it is our responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of US and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to armed conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to. First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti-fragility measures and increase resilience through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply and by making strategic investments in startups with cutting-edge technologies.\nFor example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment to accelerate our Additive Manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies, and complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers.\nWe also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called Forward Edge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting edge microprocessors that we need.\nSecond, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter Lockheed Martin worked together with a team including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight, and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient hybrid 5G and military data link network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G mil unified network solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi-node hybrid network for integrating land, air, and space operations.\nTogether, we demonstrated absolutely cutting-edge system capabilities, performance, and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates.\nThird, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the US can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress towards a mission centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers, and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our US and allied customers.\nOne example from 2023 is work with Australia to develop phase one of AIR 6500. That's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners, can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system.\nLast week, Lockheed Martin was awarded the Guided Weapons Production Capability Risk Reduction Activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a pathfinder to manufacturing our.\nSuite of guided munitions in Australia with.\nTheir workforce and with contributions from their society and their economy.\nTurning briefly now to the status of the US defense budget, the current proposed agreement being discussed with the Administration and Congress would support an $886 billion top line budget 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the US budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well supported as the process unfolds. I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations, starting with aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR-2 configuration in Q4, bringing the 2023 total to 90 F-35s.\nWe are making continued progress towards delivering the first TR3 configured aircraft today. Over 90% of the TR3 functionality is currently in flight test and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems. While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time.\nThan we originally anticipated.\nThe second quarter customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that a third quarter may be a more likely scenario for a TR-3 software acceptance. We are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it. The Step Function technological advances of TR-3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing, and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come.\nThese include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, advanced sensing, jamming, and cybersecurity capabilities, and more accurate target recognition.\nTo achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run. The resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR-3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future.\nGiven the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft as a cornerstone of all domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong. In December, the Republic of Korea made the decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35s that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030s.\nARRW also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November in a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world-class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets. In addition, we delivered the first two Slovakian F-16 Block 70 jets in Q4. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025.\nOur Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well, and for a change, I can actually tell you about one, the X-59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA was selected as one of Time magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X-59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's most persistent challenges. The X-59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year.\nOur MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities. In Q4, we delivered the first precision strike missile or PrSM, to the US Army and conducted system qualification tests for an Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptor to the US government in October.\nWe successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot missile with the US Army's new air and missile defense radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonics. International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong too.\nThis year, Switzerland and Romania each signed letters of offer and acceptance for PAC-3 MSEs, marking 15 partner nations for this program.\nRMS also saw strong international interest. In the fourth quarter, the US Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contracts to produce eight MH-60 Romeo Seahawk helicopters for the Spanish Navy and six of them for the.\nNorwegian government as well.\nTo date, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60 Romeo aircraft to five countries, including the United States. 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia, and now Spain and Norway. Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the US Army's improved turbine engine on our Raider X, designed for the Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, program. This final phase of the Raider X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high-tech future missions requirements and we anticipate the first flight of Raider X in late 2024.\nFinally turning to Space, United Launch Alliance successfully launched the Vulcan Centaur rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of two flights required to complete national security space certification, and the second planned mission could happen as soon as April.\nThe US.\nAir Force awarded Space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. The reentry vehicle or MK21A will be mounted atop the Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract, and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrence and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad. Last week the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats.\n16 of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking, and 2 space vehicles are for missile defense. Infrared sensors to be on board. The first group of 9 satellites is expected to launch in April 2027.\nlot going on at Lockheed Martin and all of our operations, and with that I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks Jim and good morning everyone. Today I will recap our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release. Today on Chart 4, we'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit.\nWe had a better than expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record. Fourth quarter sales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion with the improvement largely due to material throughput leading to a less than 1% year over year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment.\nThe strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year over year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings. Book-to-Bill was 1.15 for the year with strength across all four segments moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year over year with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count, and fewer mark-to-market losses.\nExcluding mark-to-market activity and other non-recurring charges, Adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year over year or 1% for the year.\nAdjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year over year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about a dollar per share from our original expectations last January. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter. From strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections,\nwe maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow. Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on three converging demand cycles.\nFirst, to meet support requirements of the near and midterm security environment. Second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability, and embedded intelligence, and lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority and in deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements that closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities.\nThe long cycle nature of Lockheed Martin's systems has in part led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion as well as our return to top line growth a year earlier than originally expected. We demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning among these demand cycles and multi-year outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns.\nOver the past two years we have repurchased about 12% of the current market capitalization. Okay, back to the segment details and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7, fourth quarter sales at Aeronautics were comparable year over year with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp offset by lower volume on F-35 primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments for the year. Sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single digit decline on F-35.\nProfit declined by 1% primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog, shifting to missiles and fire control. On page 8, sales in the quarter decreased 4% year over year driven by lower volume on PAC-3 due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year over year as expected due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program.\nFor the year, sales decreased 1% year over year as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at sensors and global sustainment, and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing. Operating profit was down 6% due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program.\nLast book-to-bill for the year was 1.3, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike missiles. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, sales declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors, and training and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of international Blackhawks. Operating profit increased 2%, mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio.\nFor the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from radar and battle management system ramps more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments.\nBook-to-Bill for the year was 1.14, with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms as well as radar, and battle management systems on Chart 10. As expected, Space growth moderated in the quarter, with sales increasing 3% year over year driven by higher volume in strategic, and missile defense, primarily from next-gen interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of preliminary design review towards the critical design review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022 Q2 driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio.\nFor the year, sales increased 9% with growth across all lines of businesses, and profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments, and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income.\nSpace backlog grew again in fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion, or almost 2.2 and a half times sales. Now shifting to the outlook for 2024 on page 11. Before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year. First, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the US Government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the President's FY24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top line growth from the DoD on F-35.\nAs Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from two production lots amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results.\nWith that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 and $70 billion with a midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth. At the midpoint we expect growth in three of the four segments with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from its strong munitions backlog. At the high end, all four segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 and $7.375 billion down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC Classified program,\n50 basis points impact underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%. Our net FAS/C pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024 due primarily to lower FAS pension income.\nThe pension headwind, along with lower segment profit and higher interest expense, leads to lower expected EPS year over year to be between $25.65 and $26.35. For purposes of clarity on page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range. Benefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline. Total FAS pension is about $1.40 headwind, with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion,\nso bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base. Some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation and capping it off with another year of capital deployment.\nIn summary on page 13, we closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024 with a line of sight to sustained out-year growth in sales, profit, and free cash flow. Of course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes, and systems remain the most advanced in the industry, and we remain committed to disciplined and dynamic capital returns to shareholders. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0. On your touch-tone phone, you will hear a tone or annunciator indicating that you've been placed in the queue. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing the 1 then 0 again. If you are using a speakerphone or Bluetooth, please pick up your handset before pressing the number once again. If you have a question, please press 1 then 0 at this time. And our first question is from Miles Walton from Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. I was hoping to lead off with Aero and the F-35 in particular. The margins, number one, that you're looking for in 2024 are down about 40 basis points. Is that primarily on lower incentives as a result of the delays in delivery, and then more broadly for the supply chain on the F-35, given the absence of deliveries, can you continue to simply build inventory, or is there a point at which you'd actually have to slow down the supply chain? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Thanks, Miles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments. And so it's really twofold. One of it is the F-35, whereas we make progress on the TR-3 program, as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so we assume that the profit adjustments slow down in 2024 on the F-35 program. There's also some headwinds on the C-130 program, where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chain, some pressures that we've had there.\nAnd so when you look at that decline year over year, you're talking about 30 basis points, say half and half, between C-130 and F-35 on the production cadence for F-35, you know, yes, we, you know, we feel pretty confident in where we are through Q3. To the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time. But right now, all signs are pointing to our production and delivery restart here in Q3.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\nGood morning, Jay.\nI hate to ask on 2025, but.\nAt a high level, is it the?\n10.5% total company margin guide for 2024? Is that the right jumping off point for thinking about 2025, or is it the, you know, 11% underlying margin or is it the 10.8% margin you did in 2023? Just in terms of identifying jumping off point, we're thinking about 2025.\nThank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, I think you do have to start at the 10.5 to jump off. And you know, we do have a line of sight and a path to get overall back to 11%, including the absorption of these losses on the MSC classified program. But it's going to be a gradual march back up. And so I wouldn't expect it to snap back in 2025. I would expect there to be in the range of say, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement starting in 2025 and that to continue to grow at that rate until we get back up to 11.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS Equity Research\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS Equity Research\n\nJay.\nWhat does the pension contribution schedule look like beyond 2024, and do you have any opportunity to pull that forward or use the balance sheet to offset that?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, good question. That's something that we contemplate just where we are from a baseline perspective. Zero contributions required in 2024; 2025, we're looking at in the range of about $1 billion of required contributions there. And so, you know, we're always looking at whether or not there's an opportunity to pull forward, as you mentioned, the utilization of our strong balance sheet to potentially do that. We haven't made any firm decisions on that, but that's definitely an opportunity that's under consideration for us.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS Equity Research\n\nThanks.\nYep, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is from the line of Peter Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global Advisor\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\nJim or Jay, can you give us a sense for how much the 2024 guide is impacted by what looks like a, you know, on the order of a six-month delay here to the government's budget, and you know, still a little bit of a lack of clarity on the supplementals?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, for the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly. You know, in our case, we're able to build up inventories, and then as we get the funding, we're able to take that to sales, and so for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact. That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. And that's why I was very clear in my comments that we're dependent on this happening, that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March because going beyond that makes it very.\nJust makes it difficult for things that get on contract, and you run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global Advisor\n\nOkay, appreciate it. And then anything on big awards you're expecting in 2024 and maybe the timing of NGAD?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, just some key things that we're talking about from sales perspective. Lot 1819 is a big one for the F-35 program. We also have some long lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things, there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that. But you're talking multi billions of dollars there that we have in our, in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY24 requirements. And also I would say hypersonics at space, particularly on CPS, is another one that can approach $2 billion.\nSo there's a number there, you know, as those get clicked off in the year. We'll certainly report on those and keep you apprised on the progress.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global Advisor\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi Research\n\nYeah, hey Jay, just a quick clarification and one for Jim, and sorry if I missed this, but the deliveries that you're expecting for the F-35 this year with the, you know, the acceptance on TR-3 happening potentially in Q3. Can you discuss a little bit about the cadence throughout the year? Do you expect to deliver some F-35s throughout the year and maybe, you know, the older version of it in the first half of the year? Just trying to get a sense of whether you're truly doing 7,500 aircraft in the second half of the year. And what does that tell us about, you know, the potential for deliveries in 2025? Can you get to 200 in that year as a bit of a catch up?\nAnd then Tim, for you, just overall expectations on, you know, bookings, Book-to-Bill for this next year based on the pipeline that you're seeing, and maybe just kind of update us on your current thoughts on the competitive environment, and you know, Fixed Price versus, you know, Cost Plus, and how you, how the industry and you all specifically are kind of reacting to the contracting environment and what's being asked of you, and whether you're toggling back more towards less risky programs? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo let me get into the deliveries, Jason. You know, we do have a handful of deliveries that we expect in the first half, but for the most part you're talking, you know, 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so I think that's just a way to think about just a handful really in the first half.\nYou know, maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim for the year. We still expect there to be strong demand, and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book-to-bill that would be above one yet again in 2024. So, you know, obviously these things have to materialize, the budget has to be approved, and all these things have to happen. But the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders as well in our backlog. A couple of things too. And you've just heard the question about cost-plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix; our percent of sales of cost-type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023.\nThat in itself caused some margin pressure about 20 basis points relative to what we were anticipating. And so we're actually seeing an uptick in cost plus contracts, which we think bodes well in terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so I think that is generally speaking a favorable trend. Well, the other thing that we're, you know, just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here, is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently.\nAnd we're looking at things and ensuring that it's just a more analytical support for the way we approach pricing, that we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have.\nAlso, that as we make an assessment of risk, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but that our pricing accounts for that risk as well. So that's the way we've been approaching things for really this year going into 2024. I'll hand it over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, sure, Jay. So look, there's a near term and.\nA long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. The near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company. I'll say, and I don't know what other companies are doing or how they're making their decisions, but you know, we've recognized and I've said to our senior.\nCustomer base, you know, look, we're in.\nA monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer, you know, for the most part, for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or General Dynamics makes, and you know, to, I guess, the government's credit in a way, they've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry. And what's happened as a result of that over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over cost overruns, right?\nWhether fixed price or cost plus, and you have schedule delays. Because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that there are must win programs for them, that they will take tremendous risk on cost and pricing and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities.\nSo when you multiply those two risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs you know reviewed by Congress, et cetera. So I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company. We don't have any must win programs at Lockheed Martin anymore. If we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price risk profile, we will bid.\nIf not, we will not bid.\nIf we hit our limit parameters, we.\nWon't go beyond those. A competitor may win, so be it. And so that's our near term approach to this.\nThe longer term approach is, in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do certainly so well, we need to start migrating towards delivering capabilities, right? So capability would include either products that.\nare already fielded and/or new products, but especially digital technologies.\nWhich is why we are collaborating with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small, because we can value price capabilities, right?\nIf we sell products, and that's all.\nWe, as an industry, we are kind of locked into the FAR, the.\nFederal Acquisition Regulation as it is written.\nToday, which means even a Fixed Price.\nContract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right?\nYou have to do it often.\nEvery year, even with a multi-year fixed price.\nThere can be adjustments. We want to move as briskly.\nAs we can, as an industry with our commercial partners, to their kind of.\nPricing, which is value-based subscription. That's going to take time. It's going to take changes in government. It's going to probably take literally acts of Congress to do it.\nBut that will be the thing that.\nWill make our industry healthier. On one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry. But it will also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope, investing.\n10x what we are in R&D.\nWe want to bring a lot of that 10x R&D and all that talent over into the Defense Department as part of their supply chain. But it's really tough under the FAR for those companies to put time and attention and effort into DoD. So that's the long term, a long term solution. But the near term solution will also continue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning.\nThank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nMorning.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nAs you look at Tech Refresh 3, this delay and then going longer as you really want to build out the full kind of Block 4 capabilities which continue to seem to expand.\nFirst, as Technology Refresh 3 takes longer and then as you look toward the kind of multiyear trajectory on Block 4 implementation, how do you see delays here affecting your production rate, knowing that you've been trying to produce sort of at the full 156 type rate? But can that continue as you look at these challenges, if they get more difficult?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou know, look, Doug, it's Jim. I think we can continue at this rate.\nYou know, demand from the US services.\nOur international customers, you know, air forces, navies, et cetera around the world is they need the aircraft. Right. They've got to recapitalize, recapitalize the planes that they're still flying that I was trying to get when I went to pilot training in 1983. Right. So this is essential that this production line keep up. It's the basically it's the recapitalization of the allied fighter aircraft force is the F-35. And so I think the key to that is full transparency and.\nRealizing the reality of the situation. When you're trying to drive this much technology into an air vehicle, you've got to be honest about the schedule.\nWhat can industry do?\nWhat can the test and evaluation community handle in the various militaries to accept that technology, and what's the supply chain capacity? And we're being.\nBrutally honest with our.\nServices and our joint program offices to.\nWhat we think industry can do with us and our airplane. And industry is who makes the radar, industry is who makes the EOTS, the electro-optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite.\nIt's not us. So we have to be brutally honest as an industry.\nWith our suppliers, inputs to that, with the government, and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up. I think that's starting to get traction.\nI hope it gets more traction because we cannot afford to.\nBe over optimistic.\nIn the ability to deliver these technologies as rapidly as one might like. There are real technical and physical challenges to doing this. Our commitment to the government, me to the service chiefs, and our allies is I will tell you honestly what we think industry can do with the jet. If you want to push it beyond that, I'll tell you what the risks are and what the cost might be to do it. Let's agree on a feasible, executable plan for exactly, Doug, what you talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Jim, I don't want to talk about what happened in 1983, but in terms of the puts and takes for MFC, if you could just talk about the 7% top line growth you guys have. What are the biggest program drivers there between missile defense and tactical? And just on the margins, you've already highlighted the 50 basis points from the classified programs. Are there any offsets? And I really appreciate your commentary about the government and how you plan to sell to them. So I was just thinking, where do you think that'll manifest itself in its portfolio? In your portfolio the fastest, is it MFC and specifically, can you give any specifics?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. I'll start with the growth drivers. You know, for MFC, they're what you would expect. Tactical and strike missiles. So the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM, all those will continue towards their march to full-rate production ramps for FY 2025 and in certain cases 2026 and 2027. So that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by integrated air and missile defense, really on the back of PAC-3. So we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025 and ultimately 650 by 2027.\nSo those are the two, really the two businesses, the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which really should be no surprise.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWhen it gets to moving towards.\nA value pricing model, Sheila, the first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control.\nCommand situational awareness, information advantage, as our customers would call it. So those are largely digital services, right? You know, you've got, you know, sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out, you know, scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space, you know, looking for plumes of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So how do we gather all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be in, land, air, space, et cetera?\nHow do we make intelligent data fusion and then present commanders and decision makers with options using AI and other digital services? So this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that. Digital.\nDigital data fusion, evaluation, AI application, et cetera. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas. We need to take advantage of that. The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. They're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the cost that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government so they can give you the margin on top. These command and control systems, and they're real programs, by the way. Defense of Guam is a program like this.\nAIR 6500 is one that I mentioned, and also something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the INDOPACOM command of the US, so this is.\nWhere I think it will start.\nAnd then, as we look at mission roadmaps that we've established and drawn out inside of Lockheed Martin, and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the US services and DoD, we're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? So I'll give you one really quick one. So if we could get a direct feed from an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly.\nProvide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area, then those aircraft can vector towards those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sink the ship, if that's what's needed. And so that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an anti-ship mission. And so how do we value price that? Because that's basically a data management.\nExercise which requires what we call 5G.MIL. It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires the management of that data at various classifications, which is something not many companies can do besides those in our industry. So we can value price, something like that. And I think it would be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense, and they might accept value pricing. But not to take too much time on this topic, but one of the things that we're really advocating for Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends.\nOf the court trying to work with us on this is how do we set up an adjacent.\nAcquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed, reconstituted, and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do? That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated. It's what I kind of referenced earlier, where you're literally going to need an act of Congress to do this. But if we want to value price as an industry, bring in commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLet me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example. In 2024, when you look at their headwind, their headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression. In the year 2024, the MFC classified program actually accounted for 230. And so the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business in general, across all of Lockheed Martin. The way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist.\nThe second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity, and also 1LMX-driven efficiencies.\nAnd then, lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bid and proposals. And so, those three together will help us drive to a better result in the future and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins even with these headwinds.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much and good morning everyone. Maybe one clarification and one question, Jay, on F-35 at the end of 2024: should we think about there being maybe 120 undelivered aircraft in inventory based on, you know, the production rate of, you know, 150-plus and the deliveries you've told us? That's, that's the clarification. And that inventory will have to be worked out over the subsequent year or two. And then as far as the question goes, I think you talked about 10 to 20 basis points of segment margin expansion in 2025. You know, if we thought about only one lot exercised on classified missiles, that's probably 25 basis points.\nThe margin in aeronautics seems pretty depressed in 2024. So you'd think there may be some potential for expansion there. And you just talked about the efforts that you're making across the company to support margins.\nAre there other discrete headwinds that we're not aware of that wouldn't allow that would prevent more than that kind of 10 to 20 basis points that you outlined?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLet me start with that question first, and I'll come back to the F-35 just on the 20, 25 margins going forward. Yes, it would be essentially one lot versus two. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that were in these first two lots. And so you really think about it. From a gross headwind, it doesn't necessarily change all that much because there's more in there. And so that's what's keeping the pressure. You know, there's not just an automatic lift because we're going from two lots to one lot in a subsequent year on the F-35. I think the way you talked about it, Seth, is right.\nAnywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft is, in terms of undelivered against the 156 type of expected delivery rate, the right way to think about it. Yes.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nQuestion.\nI'll do the question first.\nWhat are you thinking about the opportunity for the Black Hawk going forward? Meaning.\nI don't know. We've kind of heard there's some challenges on future vertical lift. What opportunities does that open to you for the Black Hawk?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRon, it's Jim. Look, the Black Hawk.\nYou know, I've gotten to fly it autonomously and by hand, actually. I think has a lot of potential. There's interest in Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk. There's a huge fleet out there, and by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's out flying in units today in great numbers and across our allies, that's a real, I think, value opportunity for the Army and Marine Corps and others that use the helicopter. So I do think there's a lot of upside there.\nI don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing, but this is a proven scaled vehicle which with digital technology upgrade and insertion can be very, very versatile, and that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft.\nSo I do think that there's upside there. Now the services and Congress have to agree to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying and that'll be up to them. But we are trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of a hot water landing zone, things like that. That, when you put it into the entire equation of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Hey Jay, Jim. I mean, there's been discussion in the public markets about the depletion of US missiles, munitions, and a potential shortage. I mean, that said, from your commentary today, it sounds like supply chain issues continue to linger, weighing on the company's ability to convert the demand into revenue. So can you talk more about the additional actions you're taking to improve the supply chain's ability to get products through the system, and what metrics are you monitoring, and how much upside could you see in 2024 if things improve?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nI'll make a couple comments and ask Jay to follow.\nThe steps that we're taking to take the fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is, and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well. Right. That's one piece.\nMore broadly, we're using Additive Manufacturing and.\nWe're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors. And also we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment, including in Australia, Poland, in Poland, UK, and others are kind of on tap for co-production or joint ventures with us to do these things in Germany, I should mention as well. So these are some of the approaches we're taking, and it really comes down to these three areas which is how can we on one hand take basic steps antifragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain, different labor pools, better training,\nthose kinds of things where you're just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this a more reliable production system, which we just mentioned?\nThen thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their sub supply chains, et cetera, and get them into the production system? So we look at this in all three areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production. Jay, anything you want to add?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, I'll just say over the last year, Kristine, you know, we've deployed resources. So we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement depending on the supplier, depending on the issues. We have deployed manufacturing engineering resources, we've deployed quality engineering resources, and program management resources as well as in certain cases, we've actually deployed hourly workers to support suppliers in certain cases. And so we've taken an all hands on deck approach where we've seen the issues become more significant and we've done everything we can to support these suppliers and help them get through.\nI would expect that to continue where we see, you know, these bottlenecks. But as I mentioned earlier, we did see some general improvement. We are expecting that improvement to continue.\nYou know, in terms of potential upside, what I would point you to is that if we're able to unlock and see a little bit better performance and that would drive us to the end of our sales, profit, and EPS range.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Could you touch on F-16 real quick? Just the latest thoughts on the ramp right here. And also just margins on that program.\nHow that compares to the segment now?\nAnd then sort of do they get.\nBetter over time as you kind of come back down the learning curve?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, so we delivered five aircraft in 2023. We would expect that to triple or potentially quadruple here in 2024. And so the ramp is certainly in full force. We've got over 30 aircraft there in WIPP as we ended the year. And so, you know, that is, I think from a delivery standpoint, increasing the production cadence is all trending well. From a profitability standpoint, you may recall, we've had some pressure because it's taken us longer to get to this point. And so that puts some pressure on our initial contracts here. As we fully deliver those out and deliver on the subsequent contracts, we will see profitability improve on the F-16 over the next few years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nYes, hello.\n\nGeorge Shapiro {Analyst]\n\nShapiro Research\n\nA longer term perspective here. If I look at the margins like from 10 years ago, you know, MFC made 18%, Aeronautics made 11%, Space made 13%. And so we're obviously down in all of those categories overall, maybe 200 basis points from 10 years ago. So my question is, was this due to a lot of the fixed price development, more aggressive bidding, and now you're trying to change that? So when we look towards 2025, we actually could see margins go up from where they'd be in 2024 or kind of are they just lower margins overall that we expect to see from what we used to see?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGeorge, hey, it's Jim here.\nI think the story I told a.\nLittle bit earlier today is what caused that. There's margin compression in the whole industry here, driven by the monopsony customer, if you will.\nSo they got pretty good at figuring out how to use their position.\nIn the Porter analysis of how they should negotiate contracts. What I think you're seeing is boards and management of companies in our traditional space, I'll call it, are understanding this. Now the management, not necessarily senior management, tends not to necessarily be historically wedded to this business model and looking at other ways to run these companies. So we are taking the shareholders' interest into account in all the things we talked about, which should help improve our margins, even though it may result in some difficulties, discussions with some of the customer base. We're prepared to do that.\nBut I think over the last 10 years, as you said, there's been a decline and it needs to reverse to have a healthy industry.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Treasurer and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Hey Lois, I think we're at the top of the hour, so I'm just going to turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay, thanks Maria. So over the past 12 months again I mentioned the people of Lockheed Martin.\nHave worked relentlessly to advance this vision we have for 21st Century Security and transform our company internally. They created, produced, and delivered cutting-edge capabilities that are focused on what.\nThe Department of Defense says is its own.\nStrategy that they call Integrated Deterrence. We're trying to maintain our company.\nValues along the way.\nThat's to do what's right, respect others, and perform with excellence.\nAll this yields positive results for our employees that work here, our customers.\nAnd our suppliers and especially our shareholders.\nSo thanks again for joining us today.\nWe look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April.\nLois, that concludes the call.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for use in AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.\nIt.\nWe're sorry, your conference is ending now.\nPlease hang up.\nSa.\nSa.\nIt.\nGood day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q4 and full year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century Security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders. Turning to Chart 3, robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems, and other products, services, and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion.\nFull year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year over year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55.\nTo position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development, and capital. In 2023, we generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid-single digits. We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders, over $9 billion, through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook include low-single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base and a range of $6 to $6.3 billion of free cash flow.\nOur ongoing dividends and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024.\nWe also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century Security in the.\nYeah, as we believe that it is.\nOur responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of US and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to armed conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to. First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti fragility measures and increase resilience through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply, and by making strategic investments in startups with cutting edge technologies. For example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment to accelerate our additive manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies in complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers.\nWe also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called Forward Edge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting edge microprocessors that we need.\nSecond, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter Lockheed Martin worked together with a team including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight, and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient hybrid 5G and military data link network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G.MIL unified network solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi node hybrid network for integrating land, air, and space operations.\nTogether, we demonstrated absolutely cutting edge system capabilities, performance, and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates.\nThird, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the US can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress towards a mission centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers, and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our US and allied customers.\nOne example from 2023 is work with Australia to develop phase one of AIR 6500, that's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners, can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system.\nLast week Lockheed Martin was awarded the Guided Weapons Production Capability Risk Reduction Activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a pathfinder to manufacturing our suite.\nOf guided munitions in Australia with their.\nworkforce and with contributions from their society and their economy.\nTurning briefly now to the status of the US Defense budget, the current proposed agreement being discussed with the Administration and Congress would support an $886 billion top line budget 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the US budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well supported as the process unfolds. I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations starting with aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration in Q4, bringing the 2023 total to 90 F-35s.\nWe are making continued progress towards delivering the first TR-3 configured aircraft today. Over 90% of the TR-3 functionality is currently in flight test, and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems. While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time than we originally anticipated. The Q2 customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that a Q3 may be a more likely scenario for a TR-3 software acceptance.\nWe are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it. The Step Function technological advances of TR3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing, and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come.\nThese include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, advanced sensing, jamming, and cyber security capabilities, and more accurate target recognition.\nTo achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run. The resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR-3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future.\nGiven the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft as a cornerstone of all domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong. In December, the Republic of Korea made the decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35s that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030s.\nARRW also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November in a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets. In addition, we delivered the first two Slovak F-16 Block 70 jets in the fourth quarter. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025.\nOur Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well, and for a change, I can actually tell you about one, the X-59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA, was selected as one of Time magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X-59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's most persistent challenges. The X-59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year.\nOur MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities. In Q4, we delivered the first precision strike missile or PrSM to the US Army and conducted system qualification tests for an Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptor, to the US government in October.\nWe successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot missile with the US Army's new Air and Missile Defense Radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonics. International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong too.\nThis year, Switzerland and Romania each signed letters of offer and acceptance for PAC-3 MSEs, marking 15 partner nations for this program.\nRMS also saw strong international interest. In the fourth quarter, the US Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contracts to produce eight MH-60 Romeo Seahawk helicopters for the Spanish Navy and six of them for the.\nNorwegian government as well.\nTo date, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60 Romeo aircraft to five countries, including the United States. 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia, and now Spain and Norway. Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the US Army's improved turbine engine on our Raider X, designed for the Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft or FARA program. This final phase of the Raider X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high tech future missions requirements, and we anticipate the first flight of Raider X in late 2024.\nFinally turning to Space, United Launch Alliance successfully launched the Vulcan Centaur rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of two flights required to complete National Security space certification, and the second planned mission could happen as soon as April.\nThe US Air Force awarded Space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. The reentry vehicle, or MK21A, will be mounted atop the Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract, and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrence and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad. Last week, the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats.\n16 of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking, and 2 space vehicles are for missile defense. Infrared sensors to be on board. The first group of 9 satellites is expected to launch in April 2027.\nA lot going on at Lockheed Martin, all of our operations, and with that I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today on Chart 4. We'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit. We had a better than expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record fourth quarter.\nSales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion, with the improvement largely due to material throughput leading to a less than 1% year-over-year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment.\nThe strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year over year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity. Book-to-bill was 1.15 for the year with strength across all four segments moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year over year with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count and fewer mark-to-market losses.\nExcluding mark-to-market activity and other non-recurring charges, Adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year over year or 1% for the year.\nAdjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year over year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about a dollar per share from our original expectations last January. Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter from strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections.\nWe maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow. Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on three converging demand cycles.\nFirst, to meet support requirements of the near and midterm security environment. Second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability, and embedded intelligence. And lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority and deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements that closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities.\nThe long cycle nature of Lockheed Martin's systems has in part led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion as well as our return to top line growth a year earlier than originally expected. We demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning amongst these demand cycles and multiyear outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns.\nOver the past two years we have repurchased about 12% of the current market capitalization. Okay, back to the segment details and starting with aeronautics on Chart 7, fourth quarter sales at Aeronautics were comparable year over year with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp offset by lower volume on F-35, primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments for the year. Sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single digit decline on F-35. Profit declined by 1% primarily due to lower profit adjustments.\nBook-to-bill for the year was 1.14, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion, with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog, shifting to missiles and fire control on page 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 4% year over year, driven by lower volume on PAC-3 due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year over year, as expected, due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program.\nFor the year, sales decreased 1% year over year, as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at sensors and global sustainment, and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing. Operating profit was down 6% due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program.\nLast book-to-bill for the year was 1.3, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike missiles.\nTurning to rotary and mission systems on page nine, sales declined 2% in the quarter driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors, training, and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of international Black Hawks. Operating profit increased 2% mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio. For the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from radar and battle management system ramps more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2% primarily due to lower profit adjustments.\nBook-to-Bill for the year was 1.14 with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms as well as radar and battle management systems on Chart 10.\nAs expected, space growth moderated in the quarter with sales increasing 3% year over year driven by higher volume in strategic and missile defense, primarily from next gen interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of preliminary design review towards the critical design review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022 driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio. For the year, sales increased 9% with growth across all lines of businesses and profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income.\nSpace backlog grew again in fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion or almost 2.2 and a half times sales. Now shifting to the outlook for 2024 on page 11 before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year.\nFirst, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the US Government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the President's FY24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top line growth for the DoD on F-35. As Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from two production lots amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results.\nWith that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 and 70 billion with a midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth. At the midpoint, we expect growth in three of the four segments with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from its strong munitions backlog.\nAt the high end, all four segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 and 7.375 billion, down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC Classified program, 50 basis points impact underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%. Our net FASC pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024 due primarily to lower FAS pension income.\nThe pension headwind along with lower segment profit, and higher interest expense lead to lower expected EPS year over year to be between $25.65 and 26.35. For purposes of clarity on page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range.\nBenefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline. Total FASC pension is about $1.40 headwind, with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. So bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base, some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation and capping it off with another year of capital deployment.\nSo in summary on page 13, we closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024 with a line of sight to sustained out-year growth in sales, profit, and free cash flow.\nOf course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes, and systems remain the most advanced in the industry and we remain committed to disciplined and dynamic capital returns to shareholders. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your touchtone phone. You will hear a tone or annunciator indicating that you've been placed into queue. You may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the 1 then 0 again. If you are using a speakerphone or Bluetooth, please pick up your handset before pressing the number once again. If you have a question, please press 1 then 0 at this time.\nOur first question is from Miles Walton from Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks.\nGood morning. I was hoping to lead off with Aero and the F-35 in particular. The margins, number one, that you're looking for in 2024 are down about 40 basis points. Is that primarily on lower incentives as a result of the delays in delivery, and then more broadly for the supply chain on the F-35, given the absence of deliveries, can you continue to simply build inventory or is there a point at which you'd actually have to slow down the supply chain? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay, thanks, Miles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments. And so it's really twofold. One of it is the F-35, where, as we make progress on the TR-3 program, as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so we assume that the profit adjustments slow down in 2024 on the F-35 program.\nThere's also some headwinds on the C-130 program where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chain, some pressures that we've had there. And so when you look at that decline year over year, you're talking about 30 basis points, let's say half and half, between C-130 and F-35 on the production cadence for F-35.\nYes, we feel pretty confident in where we are through Q3. To the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time. But right now all signs are pointing to our production and delivery restart here in Q3.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Jay.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI hate to ask on 2025, but at a high level, is it the 10.5% total company margin guide for 2024, is that the right jumping off point for thinking about 2025, or is it the, you know, 11% underlying margin or is it the 10.8% margin you did in 2023? Just in terms of identifying jumping off point, we're thinking about 2025%.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you. Yeah, I think you do have to start at the 10.5 to jump off. And you know, we do have a line of sight and a path to get overall back to 11%, including the absorption of these losses on the MSC classified program. But it's going to be a gradual march back up. And so I wouldn't expect it to snap back in 2025. I would expect there to be, you know, in the range of, say, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement starting in 2025 and that to continue to grow at that rate until we get back up to 11.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS Equity Research\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS Equity Research\n\nJay.\nWhat does the pension contribution schedule look like beyond 2024? And do you have any opportunity to pull that forward or use the balance sheet to offset that?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, good question. That's something that we contemplate just where we are from a baseline perspective. Zero contributions required in 2024. 2025, we're looking at in the range of about $1 billion of required contributions there. And so, you know, we're always looking at whether or not there's an opportunity to pull forward, as you mentioned, the utilization of our strong balance sheet to potentially do that. We haven't made any firm decisions on that, but that's definitely an opportunity that's under consideration for us.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS Equity Research\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYep, thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global Advisor\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\nJim or Jay, could you give us a sense for how much the 2024 guidance is impacted by what looks like on the order of a six-month delay here to the government's budget and still a little bit of a lack of clarity on the supplementals?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, for the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly in our case. We're able to build up inventories, and then as we get the funding, we're able to take that, the sales. So for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact. That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. That's why I was very clear in my comments that we're dependent on this happening, that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March, because going beyond that makes it very difficult for things to get on contract. You run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales.\nOkay, appreciate it. And then anything on big awards you're expecting in 2024 and maybe the timing of NGAD?\nWell, just, you know, just some key things that we're talking about from sales perspective. You know, Lot 18/19 is a big one for the F-35 program. We also have some long lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things; there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that. But you're talking multi billions of dollars there that we have in our, in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY24 requirements. And also I would say hypersonics at Space, particularly on CPS, is another one that can approach $2 billion.\nSo there's a number there as those get clicked off in the year. We'll certainly report on those and keep you apprised on the progress. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi Research\n\nHey Jay, just a quick clarification and one for Jim, and sorry if I missed this, but the deliveries that you're expecting for the F-35 this year, with the, you know, the acceptance on TR-3 happening potentially in Q3. Can you discuss a little bit about the cadence throughout the year? Do you expect to deliver some F-35s throughout the year and maybe, you know, the older version of it in the first half of the year? Just trying to get a sense of whether you're truly doing 7,500 aircraft in the second half of the year. And what does that tell us about, you know, the potential for deliveries in 2025; can you get to 200 in that year as a bit of a catch up.\nAnd then Tim, for you, just overall expectations on, you know, bookings book-to-bill for this next year based on the pipeline that you're seeing and maybe just kind of update us on your current thoughts on the competitive environment and you know, Fixed Price versus, you know, Cost Plus and how you, how the industry and you all specifically are kind of reacting to, to the contracting environment and what's being asked of you and whether you're toggling back more towards less risky programs. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo let me get into the deliveries, Jason. We do have a handful of deliveries we expect in the first half, but for the most part you're talking 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so I think that's just a way to think about it. Just a handful, really, in the first half. You know, maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim for the year. We still expect there to be strong demand, and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book-to-bill that would be above one yet again in 2024. And so, you know, obviously these things have to materialize, the budget has to be approved, and all these things have to happen.\nBut the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders as well as in our backlog. A couple of things too. And you just ended with the question about Cost Plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix; our percent of sales of cost-type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. That in itself caused some margin pressure, about 20 basis points relative to what we were anticipating in the year. And so we're actually seeing an uptick in Cost Plus contracts,\nwhich we think bodes well in terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so I think that is, generally speaking, a favorable trend.\nWell, the other thing that we're, you know, just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here, is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently. We're looking at things and ensuring that it's just a more analytical support for the way we approach pricing, that we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have. Also that as we make an assessment of risk, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but that our pricing accounts for that risk as well. So that's the way we've been approaching things for really this year going into 2024. I'll hand it over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, sure, Jay. So look, there's a near term and.\nA long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. The near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company. I'll say now, I don't know what other companies are doing or how they're making their decisions, but you know, we've recognized and I've said to our senior customer base, you know, look, we're in a monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer, you know, for the most part for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or General Dynamics makes, and you know, to, I guess, the government's credit in a way,\nthey've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry.\nAnd what's happened as a result of.\nThat over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over cost overruns, right? Whether Fixed Price or Cost Plus. You have schedule delays. Because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that there are must win programs for them, that they will take tremendous risk on cost and pricing, and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities. So when you multiply those two risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs reviewed by Congress, et cetera.\nSo I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company, we don't have any must win programs at Lockheed Martin anymore.\nIf we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price risk profile, we will bid.\nIf not, we will not bid.\nIf we hit our limit parameters, we.\nWon't go beyond those a competitor may.\nWin, so be it.\nThat's our near-term approach to this.\nThe longer term approach is, in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do so well, we need to start migrating towards delivering capabilities, right? So capability would include either products that are already fielded and, or new products.\nBut especially digital technologies.\nWhich is why we are collaborating with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small, because we can value price capabilities, right?\nIf we sell products, and that's all.\nWe do as an industry, we are kind of locked into the FAR.\nFederal Acquisition Regulation as it is written.\nToday, which means even a fixed price.\nContract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right?\nYou have to do it often.\nEvery year, even with a multi-year fixed price. There can be adjustments. We want to move as briskly as we can as an industry with our commercial partners to their kind of.\nPricing, which is value-based subscription.\nThat's going to take time.\nIt's going to take changes in government. It's going to probably take literally acts of Congress to do it.\nBut that will be the thing that.\nWill make our industry healthier. On one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry. But it will also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope, investing.\n10x what we are in R&D.\nWe want to bring a.\nlot of that 10x R&D and all.\nThat talent over into the Defense Department as part of their supply chain. But it's really tough under the FAR for those companies to put time, attention, and effort into DoD. So that's the long term, a long term solution. But the near term solution will also continue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\nAs you look at Technology Refresh 3, this delay and then going longer as you really want to build out the full kind of Block 4 capabilities which continue to seem to expand.\nFirst, as Technology Refresh 3 takes longer and then as you look toward the kind of multi-year trajectory on Block 4 implementation, how do you see delays here affecting your production rate, knowing that you've been trying to produce sort of at the full 156-type rate? But can that continue as you look at these challenges, if they get more difficult?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLook, Doug, it's Jim. I think we can continue at this.\nRate demand from the US services and.\nOur international customers, you know, air forces, navies, et cetera, around the world is they need the aircraft, right. They've got to recapitalize the planes that they're still flying that I was trying to get when I went to pilot training in 1983. Right. So this is essential that this production line keep up. It's the, basically it's the recapitalization of the, you know, the allied fighter aircraft force is the F-35. And so I think the key to that is full transparency and.\nRealizing the.\nReality of the situation. When you're trying to drive this much technology into an air vehicle, you've got to be honest about the schedule.\nWhat can industry do?\nWhat can the test and evaluation community handle in the various militaries to accept that technology, and what's the supply chain capacity? And we're being.\nBrutally honest with our.\nServices and our joint program officers to.\nWhat we think industry can do with us and our airplane industry is who makes the radar, industry is who makes the EOTS, the electro-optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite. It's not us. So we have to be brutally honest as a, as an industry.\nWith our suppliers, inputs to that, with the government, and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up. I think that's starting to get traction.\nI hope it gets more traction because we cannot afford to.\nBe over optimistic.\nIn the ability to deliver these technologies as rapidly as one might like. There are real technical and physical challenges to doing this. And our commitment to the government, me to the service chiefs and our allies, is I will tell you honestly what we think industry can do with the jet. And if you want to push it beyond that, I'll tell you what the risks are and what the cost might be to do it. But let's agree on a feasible executable plan for exactly, Doug, what you talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning guys. Jim, I don't want to talk about what happened in 1983, but in terms of the puts and takes for MFC, if you could just talk about the 7% top line growth you guys have, what are the biggest program drivers there between missile defense and tactical. And just on the margins, you've already highlighted the 50 basis points from the classified programs. Are there any offsets? And I really appreciate your commentary about the government and how you plan to sell to them. So I was just thinking, where do you think that'll manifest itself in its portfolio? In your portfolio the fastest, is it MFC and specifically, can you give any specifics?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, sure. I'll start with the growth drivers. And you know, for MFC, they're what you would expect. Tactical and strike missiles. So the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM, all those will continue towards their march through these ramps for by 2025 and in certain cases 2026 and 2027. So that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by integrated air and missile defense, really on the back of PAC-3. So we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025 and ultimately 650 by 2027. So those are the two, really the two businesses, the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which really should be no surprise.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content3": "When it gets to moving towards.\nA value pricing model, Sheila. The first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control.\nCommand, situational awareness, information advantages, our customers would call it. So those are largely digital services, right? You've got sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space, you know, looking for plumes of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So how do we gather all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be in, land, air, space, et cetera? How do we make intelligent data fusion and then present commanders and decision makers with options using AI and other digital services?\nSo this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that.\nDigital data fusion, evaluation, AI application, et cetera. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas. And we need to take advantage of that. The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. They're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the cost that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government so they can give you the margin on top. So these command and control systems, and.\nThey're real programs, by the way.\nof Guam is a program like this. MH-60 is one that I mentioned, and also something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the INDOPACOM command of the US, so this is.\nWhere I think it will start.\nAnd then as we look at mission roadmaps that we've established and drawn out inside Lockheed Martin and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the US services and DoD, we're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? So I'll give you one really quick one. So if we could get a direct feed from an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly.\nProvide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area. Then those aircraft can vector towards those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sink the ship, if that's what's needed. And so that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an anti-ship mission. And so how do we value price that? Because that's basically a data management.\nExercise which requires what we call 5G.MIL. It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires the management of that data at various classifications, which is something not many companies can do besides those in our industry. So we can value price, something like that. And I think it'd be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense, and they might accept value pricing. But not to take too much time on this topic, but one of the things that we're really advocating for Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends.\nof the cohorts trying to work with us on this is how do we set up an adjacent acquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed and reconstituted and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do? That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated. It's what I kind of referenced earlier, where you're literally going to need an act of Congress to do this. But if we want to value price as an industry, bring in commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLet me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example. In 2024, when you look at their headwind, their headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression. In the year 2024, the MFC classified program actually accounted for 230. And so the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business in general, across all of Lockheed Martin. The way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist. The second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity, and also 1LMX-driven efficiencies.\nAnd then lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bid and proposals. And so those three together will help us drive to a better result in the future, and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins even with these headwinds.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from the line of. From JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much and good morning, everyone. Maybe one clarification and one question, Jay, on F-35 at the end of 2024. Should we think about there being maybe 120 undelivered aircraft in inventory based on, you know, the production rate of, you know, 150 plus and the deliveries? You've told us that's the clarification and that inventory will have to be worked out over the subsequent year or two. And then as far as the question goes, I think you talked about 10 to 20 basis points of segment margin expansion in 2025. You know, if we thought about only one lot exercised on classified missile, that's probably 25 basis points.\nThe margin in aeronautics seems pretty depressed in 2024. So you know, you'd think there may be some potential for expansion there.\nYou just talked about the efforts that you're making across the company to support margins. Are there other discrete headwinds that we're not aware of that wouldn't allow, you know, that would prevent more than that kind of 10 to 20 basis points that you outlined?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, let me start with that question first and I'll come back to the F-35 just on the 2025 margins going forward. Yes, it would be essentially one lot versus two. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that were in these first two lots. And so you really think about it from a gross headwind; it doesn't necessarily change all that much because there's more in there. And so that's what's keeping the pressure. There's not just an automatic lift because we're going from two lots to one lot in a subsequent year on the F-35. I think the way you talked about acceptance is right.\nAnywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft, in terms of undelivered against a 156 type of expected delivery rate, is the right way to think about it. Yes.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nQuestion.\nI'll do the question first.\nWhat are you thinking about the opportunity for the Black Hawk going forward? Meaning.\nI don't know. We've kind of heard there's some challenges on future vertical lift. What opportunities does that open to you for the Black Hawk?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRon, it's Jim. Looks at the Black Hawk and, you know, I've gotten to fly it autonomously and by hand. Actually, I think has a lot of potential. There's interest in Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk. There's a huge fleet out there, and by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's out flying in units today in great numbers and across our allies, that's a real, I think, value opportunity for the Army and Marine Corps and others that use the helicopter. So, I do think there's a lot of upside there.\nI don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing, but this is a proven scaled vehicle, which, with digital technology upgrade and insertion, can be very, very versatile, and that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft. So I do think that there's upside there. Now the services and Congress have to agree to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying, and that'll be up to them.\nBut we're trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of a hot landing zone, and things like that. That, when you put it into the entire equation of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey Jay, Jim. I mean there's been discussion in the public markets about the depletion of US missiles and munitions and a potential shortage of. I mean, that said, from your commentary today, it sounds like supply chain issues continue to linger, weighing on the company's ability to convert the demand into revenue. So can you talk more about the additional actions you're taking to improve the supply chain's ability to get products through the system, and what metrics are you monitoring, and how much upside could you see in 2024 if things improve?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nI'll make a couple comments and ask Jay to follow.\nThe steps that we're taking.\nThis fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is, and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well. Right. That's one piece.\nMore broadly, we're using Additive Manufacturing and.\nWe're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors. Also, we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment, including in Australia, Poland, in Poland, UK, and others are kind of on tap for co-production or joint ventures with us to do these things in Germany, I should mention as well.\nThese are some of the approaches we're taking, and it really comes down to these three areas, which is how can we, on one hand, take basic steps antifragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain, different labor pools, better training, those kinds of things, which are just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this a more reliable production system, which we just mentioned.\nAnd then thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their sub supply chains, et cetera, and get them into the production system? So we look at this in all three areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production. Jay, anything you want to add?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, I'll just say, you know, over the last year, Kristine, you know, we've deployed resources. So we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement depending on the supplier, depending on the issues. We have deployed manufacturing engineering resources, we've deployed quality engineering resources, and program management resources as well as in certain cases, we've actually deployed hourly workers to support suppliers in certain cases. And so we've taken an all hands on deck approach where we've seen the issues become more significant and we've done everything we can to support these suppliers and help them get through.\nI would expect that to continue where we see, you know, these bottlenecks. But as I mentioned earlier, we did see some general improvement. We are expecting that improvement to continue.\nIn terms of potential upside, what I would point you to is that if we're able to unlock and see a little bit better performance, and that would drive us to the high end of our sales, profit, and EPS range.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey, good morning.\nThanks guys.\nCould you touch on F-16 real quick? Just latest thoughts on the ramp right here. Also just margins on that program.\nHow that compares to the segment now?\nAnd then sort of, you know, do.\nThey get better over time as you kind of come back down the learning curve?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So we delivered five aircraft in 2023. We would expect that to triple or potentially quadruple here in 2024. And so where the ramp is in, certainly in full force. We've got over 30 aircraft. They're in WIPP as we ended the year. And so, you know, that is, I think from a delivery standpoint, increasing the production cadence is all trending well. From a profitability standpoint, you know, you may recall we've had some pressure because it's taken us longer to get to this point. And so that puts some pressure on our initial contracts here. As we fully deliver those out and deliver on the subsequent contracts, we will see profitability improvements improve on the F-16 over the next few years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorge Shapiro {Analyst]\n\nShapiro Research\n\nYes, hello. Hey, George. I was looking at a longer term perspective here. If I look at the margins like from 10 years ago, you know, MFC made 18%, aeronautics made 11%, space made 13%. And so we're obviously down in all of those categories overall, maybe 200 basis points from 10 years ago. So my question is, was this due to a lot of the fixed price development, more aggressive bidding, and now you're trying to change that? So when we look towards 2025, we actually could see margins go up from where they'd be in 2024, or kind of are they just lower margins overall that we expect to see from what we used to see?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGeorge, hey, it's Jim here.\nI think the story I told a.\nLittle bit earlier today is what caused that. There's margin compression in the whole industry here, driven by the monopsony customer, if you will.\nSo they got pretty good at figuring out how to use their position, you know, in the Porter analysis of how they should negotiate contracts. And what I think you're seeing is, you know, boards and management of companies in our traditional space, I'll call it, are understanding this. Now. The management tends to, not necessarily, senior management tends not to necessarily be historically wedded to this business model and looking at other ways to, to run these companies. And so we are taking the shareholders' interest into account in all the things we talked about, which should help improve our margins. Even though it may result in some difficult discussions with some of the customer.\nBase, we're prepared to do that.\nI think over the last 10 years, as you said, there's been a decline and it needs to reverse to have a healthy industry.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Treasurer and Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Hey, Lois, I think we're at the top of the hour, so I'm just going to turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay, thanks, Maria. So over the past 12 months again I mentioned the people of Lockheed Martin.\nHave worked relentlessly to advance this vision we have for 21st Century Security and transform our company internally. And they created, produced, and delivered cutting-edge capabilities that are focused on what.\nThe Defense Department says is its own.\nStrategy that they call Integrated Deterrence. We're trying to maintain our company values along the way.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our Q3 2023 earnings call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security, and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our Q3 results as we pursue our vision of 21st-century security, designed to support the US Department of Defense strategy of integrated deterrence. And then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on page three of the slides, sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion, and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 billion.\nEPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year, and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend, which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share purchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, re-confirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full-year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS, and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 US defense budget, global geopolitical tensions, and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full-year 2023 earnings call in January. On the US.\nbudget, though the specific trajectory of the future US defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio in elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies, and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint in government, the current Continuing Resolution, or CR, is in place through 17 November 2024. At that point, one of the following could occur: FY 2024 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR, or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel, and potentially Taiwan.\nAs Congress continues to work through the FY 2024 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the national defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. We will press on with executing our 21st-century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency, and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhanced integrated deterrence, and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program, we delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the Q3, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2, or TR-2, configuration.\nWe are producing F-35s at a rate of 156 per year and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR-3 software development and testing. We recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades, such as improved radar, next-gen distributed aperture system, and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR-3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first four locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the US.\nState Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced it will buy an additional 25 F-35s, which will add a third squadron and increase its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense as their strategic partner for their AIR6500 program, Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All-Domain Operations, or JADO, in the free world and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian Defense Force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea, and cyber domains, we expect that AIR6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide.\nThis proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enable significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase, which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st-century security cornerstone: trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services, and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam Award. In late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the Surface Force portfolio of the US Navy and Coast Guard.\nThis will link together systems and software across the services in a JADO construct, and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities, but also serves as a much more effective global deterrence strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st-century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is a OneLM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a Sniper Targeting Pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida, to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas, to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live-fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will fuse data from multiple sources across an open architecture.\nAlso, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI-commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human-crewed aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSE missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the AEGIS Weapon System. This test, performed by a OneLM team across MSC and RMS, paves the way for the design of a multi-frequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSE. In turn, that will enable the US.\nNavy, for the first time, to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong, as demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSEs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky's CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters, and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another longstanding major Lockheed Martin program, this one at space, is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension.\nFor nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the US Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrence. The Trident II D5LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor, or NGI, program executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on 29 September 2023. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission.\nFinally, the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule touched down in the Utah desert on 24 September 2023, returning NASA's first-ever sample from an asteroid after a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe, there's four billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid, and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on Earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation. After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-APEX. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our Q3 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full-year 2023 guidance and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings released today. Starting on chart four, we've consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Q3 sales increased 2% year-over-year, with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on chart five, GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate, and fewer mark-to-market losses.\nOn an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on chart six, our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter, or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion, or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay, moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven.\nQ3 sales at Aero decreased 5%, driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15 through 17 sales catch-up in the Q3 of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remained strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July, and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon.\nToday's latest version, the Block 70/72, will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the Q3, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st-century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to missiles and fire control on page eight, sales increased 4% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within Tactical Strike Missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MFC has built a strong backlog, and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions, with allied nations seeking to improve their security posture amidst today's complex threat environment.\nThis backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin, JASSM, and LRASM. Turning to rotary and mission systems on page nine, sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems, sensors, and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured, for Lots 7 and 8, the first full-rate production lots as part of the US Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners, creates additional production efficiencies, and provides the US Marine Corps with transformative capabilities.\nOn chart ten, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio, with sales increasing 8% year-over-year, driven by higher volume on NGI, Fleet Ballistic Missile, GPS, and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15% as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the Q3, helped by the $800 million Transport Layer Tranche 2 award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrence with more resilient space architectures for beyond line-of-sight targeting, data transport, and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low Earth orbit constellations.\nOkay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity but sets up for difficult compares to last year's Q4. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases, along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. Between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap.\nWe're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay, a few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I will provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program.\nIn our free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones, but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Okay, let's wrap it up. Results through the first Q3 have been solid, with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st-century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow. We're maintaining our full-year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Finally, we're executing our 21st-century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st-century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions.\nWith that, Louise, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press one, then zero on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an acknowledgment tone that you have been placed in the queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the number. Please limit yourself to one question and re-enter the queue for additional questions by pressing one and zero. One moment for our first question. Again, if you do have a question, please press one and zero. Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nMorning, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nI wanted to see if just we could understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now, the TR-3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have total confidence in that timeframe. And what I'm trying to understand is, as you continue to produce F-35s, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenues should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production, recognition of revenues, earnings, and cash flow, should that date move around? How should we think about the timing here?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Doug, on the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, you really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see, and what we are seeing today, is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. So that could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15-17 program. But as I've said in the past, we're performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15-17 than we did on Lot 12-14. So we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments. We still expect and have confidence we'll derive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thanks so much. So Jay, I think recently you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for 2024. But I think one of the issues that kind of you had mentioned had been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that could impact next year and any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins? Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, Cai, thanks. So yeah, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really is dependent upon an analysis of really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program, and then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins.\nSo we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points a headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. As far as any others, look, if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s. In 2023, we're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program, first of all, given my Air Force pilot experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be. And it'll be massively NPV positive over that longer timeframe. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phase of the contract. But at the end of the day, it'll be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated, as Jay just did, on the path to get there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. So maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35, and current partners like Israel have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off, and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our Joint Program Office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the US services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the Joint Program Office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders, that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way, to make an incremental investment.\nBut I think that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Partner, Shapiro Research\n\nYes, good morning. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production? Because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%. And then I'll sneak in one other one, which is in RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are, and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mixed benefits through some program deliveries here in the Q4, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the Q4, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially, and sustainment was up in the high teens. So solid there on sustainment. That's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein. One moment, please.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nLouise, are you still there?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. One moment. We're opening his line.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nI'm sorry. The next person that we'll go to is David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nHey. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nJay, I think the IRS came out with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I wanted to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of a higher hit associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year, given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. Thank you, David. And the first one on the R&D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost-plus contracts. And just as a reminder, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived, and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension. I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year.\nWe're going to go from about $375 million of income in 2023 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of two things. One is the returns, and the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing from the 2014 salary plan freeze. Those run out. We'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much non-cash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction, anywhere between $25 million-$50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From the cash contributions, we talked about anywhere between $500 to a billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher, for 2025.\nIf we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. I will say, you think about cash contributions to pension and what that means. We've got an enviable position in our balance sheet, and we've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. So I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies. That's the key point.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning, Jay and Jim. Maybe Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the Q4, sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal 2024 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the 2024 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the Q4? Or if it's very short, does that not impact it? I mean, maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the Q4 cash deployment.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. So year to date, we've done $3 billion with this new guide. That's $6 billion. That's $3 billion in the Q4. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, it would cause us to take a pause and another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it. So it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the Q4. If not, then it would just push probably into the Q1 and the like. And really won't see a meaningful impact there. But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean.\nIt does. You can't have new starts. It could be disruptive to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nHey, Louise, are you still there?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. I'm sorry. The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. One second. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&A, so we'll move to Rob Stallard. One moment. He's from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks very much. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Rob.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nQuestion for Jim or Jay, actually. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment, but we do have this ongoing US budget uncertainty, and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nIt's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024, and then essentially $3 billion in 2025 and $3 billion in 2026, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder for free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it'll revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year by year.\nAs you've seen the last two years, we did increase it here in the Q4, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives, and all those will go into the mix master and inform what we formally do in any given year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Seaport Research Partners\n\nThanks. Jim, Jay, Maria. Good morning. How are you?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Seaport Research Partners\n\nSo if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunities that both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume we do get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year as well as how you see backlog growth and if book-to-bill is better than one.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRichard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen, excuse me, all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024.\nIn addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer, continued to have dialogue, and we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Seaport Research Partners\n\nThanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace & Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning. Can you guys hear me?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. We can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace & Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask, Jim and Jay, you're a pretty competent management team, just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed, given the backdrop is seemingly better. Is it just the budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you could just comment on that.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, not much has really changed, to be honest. We've talked about low single digits for a while now. I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margins generally flattish. Because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that can cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow for share growth, and we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis.\nStarting with 2024, over the next couple of months, we'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the US and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in an increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before, sort of in human history, frankly.\nAnd so the opportunity for our company to take a leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced, as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, is that we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st-century technology-driving concept we have, which is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for, that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have in a national defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing, is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy.\nSo I think there are some mega trends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter to quarter, as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nMaybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year, did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of solid rocket motors, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs? Thanks.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo I'll talk about just solid rocket motors, and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring anti-fragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well.\nSo when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean, we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small, and legacy and advanced. So this is not a one-time objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign-like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important. So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty we think we can start us off with on this journey. But it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOn the question of the free cash flow per share in 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that. An incremental pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what's possible and what our plans would be. And again, we'll present that in January.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Hey, Jay, just a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're saying on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talk about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control, and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like Defensive Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the low- to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking and connecting, again, our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD.\nSo the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, etc., and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months with a combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from other partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is a, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Going back to the question on margins for next year, just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for the sake of clarity, margins excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it'll provide a drag on the margins next year. And it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25-50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHello, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nHi.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nJay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins. And you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year, next year, or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses. And then I just wondered if you could talk about a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs with prices fixed a little while ago. Is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you also, or my understanding is you also know bid a missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor, or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. They're really two different programs. I think you're referring to the Stand-in Attack Weapon award. And that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much, and so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated with the development cycle. There are these production low-rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively. And hence, we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, this would be a long-term program.\nWe know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. So we track that and monitor that. And we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case types of situations that we pursue. We're probably going to have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company. You can back into what that impact is for MFC, but I just don't have it in front of me.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. And just to give you context here, the approach we're taking, no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here as we look at programs going forward and opportunities, is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account. But we also will take into account seriously short- and mid-term risk management, especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production. Because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program whose technology is not settled in the first place yet because development hasn't been done, we would ascribe a higher risk factor to that, I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Louise, I think we have time for one more as we approach the top of the hour.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you so much. I had a question that comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi",
    "content2": "Yeah. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor and just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplemental, what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all? And then, Jay, related to international here, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else being equal, see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business? Thanks.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody's aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan-like, a defensive Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others, and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The US government will help define with the Taiwanese government what, when, and if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan through the FMS program and other vehicles.\nSo I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like, but I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions, there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOn the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for US government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue, this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting, which are more like US DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than kind of base US DoD, it will be limited. At least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. Thanks, Maria. Before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication to supporting our signature programs, their going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. All that together will really enhance deterrence globally. Especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in, I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that you, the shareholders, are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share along with a dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time. We're trying to expand the business as we go as well.\nThank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you at our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up.\nGood day and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Q3 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you, Lois, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are James Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release in our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call.\nPlease access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our Q3 2023 Earnings Call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security, and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our Third Quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st century security designed to support the US Department of Defense strategy of integrated deterrence. Then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on page three of the slides, sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion, and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 billion.\nEPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year, and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend, which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS, and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 US defense budget, global geopolitical tensions, and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January.\nOn the US budget, though the specific trajectory of the future US defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio in elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint in government, the current continuing resolution, or CR, is in place through 17 November 2024. At that point, one of the following could occur: FY 2024 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR, or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel, and potentially Taiwan.\nAs Congress continues to work through the FY 2024 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the national defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. We will press on with executing our 21st century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency, and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrence, and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program, we delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in Q3, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the technology refresh two, or TR-2, configuration.\nWe are producing F-35s at a rate of 156 per year and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR3 software development and testing. We recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades, such as improved radar, next-gen distributed aperture system, and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR-3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first four locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the US.\nState Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced it will buy an additional 25 F-35s, which will add a third squadron and increase its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense as their strategic partner for their AIR6500 program, Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All-Domain Operations, or JADO, in the free world and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian Defense Force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea, and cyber domains, we expect that AIR6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide.\nThis proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enable significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase, which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st century security cornerstone: trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services, and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defensive Guam Award. In late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the Surface Force portfolio of the US Navy and Coast Guard.\nThis will link together systems and software across the services in a JADO construct, and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities, but also serves as a much more effective global deterrence strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is a oneLM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a Sniper Targeting Pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida, to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas, to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will fuse data from multiple sources across an open architecture.\nAlso, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI-commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human-crewed aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSE missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the AEGIS Weapon System. This test, performed by OneLM team across MFC and RMS, paves the way for the design of a multi-frequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSE. In turn, that will enable the US.\nNavy, for the first time, to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong, as demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSEs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky's CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters, and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another long-standing major Lockheed Martin program, this one at space, is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension.\nFor nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the US Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrence. The Trident II D5LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor, or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on 29 September 2023. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission.\nFinally, the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule touched down in the Utah desert on 24 September 2023, returning NASA's first-ever sample from an asteroid after a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe, there's 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid, and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on Earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation. After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-APEX. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay, and join you later for questions. Jay?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our Q3 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings released today. Starting on chart four, we consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Q3 sales increased 2% year-over-year, with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year over year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%.\nMoving to earnings per share on chart five, GAAP EPS was comparable year over year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including the lower share count, lower tax rate, and fewer mark-to-market losses. On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year over year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on chart six, our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter, or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion, or 116% of free cash flow.\nAs Jim mentioned, our board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay, moving to segment results and starting with aeronautics on chart seven. Q3 sales at Aero decreased 5%, driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15-17 sales catch-up in Q3 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remained strong.\nWe delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July, and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon. Today's latest version, the Block 70/72, will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to missiles and fire control on page eight, sales increased 4% year over year, driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within tactical strike missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense.\nSegment operating profit also increased 4% year over year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MFC has built a strong backlog, and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions, with allied nations seeking to improve their security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin, JASSM, and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and Sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments.\nRMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is procured for lots seven and eight, the first full-rate production lots as part of the US Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners, creates additional production efficiencies, and provides the US Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On chart ten, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio, with sales increasing 8% year over year, driven by higher volume on NGI, Fleet Ballistic Missile, GPS, and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15% as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of Q3, helped by the $800 million Transport Layer Tranche 2 award for 36 beta satellites.\nTransport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrence with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport, and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low Earth orbit constellations. Okay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity but sets up for difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter.\nIn conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases, along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. Between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay, a few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position.\nAs I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year over year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And on free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones, but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single digit growth in free cash flow per share. Okay, let's wrap it up. Results through the first three quarters have been solid, with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow.\nWe're maintaining our full-year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Finally, we're executing our 21st century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Louise, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press one, then zero on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an acknowledgment tone that you have been placed in the queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by repeating the one-zero command. And if you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the number. Please limit yourself to one question and re-enter the queue for additional questions by pressing one and zero. And one moment for our first question. Again, if you do have a question, please press one and zero. Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nMorning, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nI wanted to see if just we could understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now, the TR-3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have total confidence in that timeframe. And what I'm trying to understand is, as you continue to produce F-35s, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenues should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production, recognition of revenues, earnings, and cash flow should that date move around? How should we think about the timing here?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Doug, on the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, you really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see, and what we are seeing today, is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. And so that could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15-17 program. But as I've said in the past, we're performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15-17 than we did on Lot 12-14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments. We still expect and have confidence we'll derive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thanks so much. So Jay, I think recently you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for 2024. But I think one of the issues that kind of you'd mentioned had been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that, how that could impact next year, and any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins? Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure, Cai, thanks. So yeah, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. In fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really is dependent upon an analysis of really the timing of recognition of these losses. There are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program, and then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. So there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins.\nSo we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25-50 basis points a headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. As far as any others, look, if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s. In 2023, we're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program, first of all, given my Air Force pilot experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be. And it'll be massively NPV positive over that longer timeframe. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phase of the contract. But at the end of the day, it'll be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated, as Jay just did, on the path to get there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. So maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35, and current partners like Israel have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off, and Jamie can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our joint program office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the US services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the joint program office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders, that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way, to make an incremental investment.\nBut I think that that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, I mean, the investment, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Partner, Shapiro Research\n\nYes, good morning. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production? Because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%. And then I'll sneak in one other one, which is in RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay, I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are, and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mixed benefits through some program deliveries here in Q4, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially, and sustainment was up in the high teens. So solid there on sustainment. That's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein. And one moment, please. I'm sorry. The next person that we'll go to is David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nJay, I think the IRS came out with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I wanted to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of a higher hit associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year, given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. Thanks, David. The first one on the R&D capitalization of draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost-plus contracts. Just as a reminder, we treat that and view it as a cost of sales, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived, and they're also restricted. We believe the draft language, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. We view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension. I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year. We're going to go from about $375 million of income in 2023 to about $50 million of loss in 2024.\nIt's a function of two things. One is the returns, and the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out. And so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much non-cash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction, anywhere between $25 million-$50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contributions, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to a billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher, for 2025. And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024.\nBut I will say, you think about cash contributions to pension and what that means. We've got an enviable position in our balance sheet, and we've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies. And that's the key point.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning, Jay and Jim. Maybe Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter, sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal 2024 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the 2024 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact it? I mean, maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. So year to date, we've done $3 billion with this new guide. That's $6 billion. That's $3 billion in Q4. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, it would cause us to take a pause and another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it. So it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in Q4. If not, then it would just push probably into Q1 and the like. And really won't see a meaningful impact there.\nBut again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean. It does. You can't have new starts. It could be disruptive to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nHey, Louise? Are you still there?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. I'm sorry. The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. One second. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard. One moment. And he's from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks very much. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Rob.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nQuestion for Jim or Jay, actually. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing US budget uncertainty, and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nIt's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024, and then essentially $3 billion in 2025 and $3 billion in 2026, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder for free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it'll revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen the last two years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter.\nWe'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives. All those will go into the mix master and inform what we formally do in any given year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Seaport Research Partners\n\nThanks. Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Seaport Research Partners\n\nSo if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set, both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume we do get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year as well as how you see backlog growth, and if book-to-bill is better than one.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRichard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. We've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen, excuse me, all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue.\nWe're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. Those are some key awards to think about for 2024.\n\nRichard Safran\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Seaport Research Partners\n\nThanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace & Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning. Can you guys hear me?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, we can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace & Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask, Jim and Jay, you're a pretty competent management team, just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed, given the backdrop is seemingly better. Is it just the budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you could just comment on that.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, not much has really changed, to be honest. We've talked about low single digits for a while now. I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margins generally flattish. Because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that can cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow for share growth, and we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis.\nStarting with 2024, over the next couple of months, we'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the US and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in an increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before, sort of in human history, frankly.\nAnd so the opportunity for our company to take a leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced, as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st-century technology-driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have an international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy.\nSo I think there are some mega trends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter to quarter, as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nMaybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year, did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year and how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of solid rocket motors, is that something for maybe developing hypersonic programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs? Thanks.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo I'll talk about just solid rocket motors, and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. Our objective is to bring anti-fragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. When it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean, we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. Then that will extend into other systems, large and small, legacy and advanced. This is not a one-time objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign-like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important.\nSo I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty we think we can start us off with on this journey. But it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOn the question of the free cash flow per share in 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that. An incremental pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. We'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the outcome of what's possible and what our plans would be. Again, we'll present that in January.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Hey, Jay, just a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're saying on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that, or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talk about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control, and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. It's these kind of programs like Defense of Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the low- to mid-single-digit billions at this point. We're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking and connecting, again, our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD.\nSo the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, etc., and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months with a combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from other partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is a, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. Going back to the question on margins for next year, just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me, for the sake of clarity, margins excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it'll provide a drag on the margins next year. And it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25-50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHello, everyone.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content3": "Good morning.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nHi.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nJay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins. You sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year, next year, or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses. Then I just wondered if you could talk about a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs with prices fixed a little while ago. Is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you also, or my understanding is you also low bid a missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor, or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. They're really two different programs. I think you're referring to the Stand-in Attack Weapon Award. And that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture of there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much, and so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated with the development cycle. There are these production low-rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively, and hence we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that.\nAs Jim mentioned, this would be a long-term program, and we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitor that, and we're confident over the long term we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case types of situations that we pursue. We're probably going to have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company. You can back into what that impact is for MFC, but I just don't have it in front of me.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. And just to give you context here, the approach we're taking, no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also will take into account seriously short- and mid-term risk management, and especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production. Because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program whose technology is not settled in the first place yet because development hasn't been done, we would ascribe a higher risk factor to that, I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. And Louise, I think we have time for one more as we approach the top of the hour.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you so much. I had a question that comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nYeah. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor and just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplemental, what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all? And then, Jay, related to international here, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else being equal, see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business? Thanks.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody's aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan-like defensive Guam award we won last year approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others, and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The US government will help define with the Taiwanese government what, when, and if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan through the FMS program and other vehicles.\nSo I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like, but I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions, there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOn the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for US government customers. In this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. A lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting, which are more like US DoD-type margins. While we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than kind of base US DoD, it will be limited. At least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS.\n\nMaria Ricciardone\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. Thanks, Maria. Before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication to supporting our signature programs, their going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrence globally. And especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in, I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that you, the shareholders, are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time. And we're trying to expand the business as we go as well.\nThank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you at our next earnings call in January. Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 2023 earnings call. I'll begin today with a few key strategic and operational highlights, and then Jay will discuss our quarterly financial results and full year 2023 outlook. Starting on page three of the slides, our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end, resulting from a Book-to-bill of $1.7 billion in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option award for the 126 F-35s for production lot 17, as well as significant awards to ramp-up munitions at MFC. This highest-ever backlog gives us visibility into multi-year sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand.\nSegment operating profit of $1.9 billion in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million, and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So, in Q2, we invested $356 million of company-funded R&D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customers' needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to you, the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales, we are raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to a revised expectation of between $66.25 billion to 66.75 billion. For EPS, we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35 to a revised expectation of between $27 to 27.20 per share.\nWe are confident in our ability to achieve these higher expectations and return to growth sooner than previously anticipated. Turning to the state of the defense budget, the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations preserved top-line defense spending at the President's budget request for FY 2024. It also stipulated defense budget growth in FY 2025 while allowing for additional support through supplemental funding. The embedded 3% growth in the proposed FY 2024 defense budget included funding for 83 F-35 aircraft, with supplemental funding to support munitions investment that will enable us to ramp up production rates under new multi-year contracting authorities. While there are still numerous steps to reach final approval and funding for the FY 2024 budget, we're encouraged by the strong support for our programs so far, and we look forward to the completion of committee reviews and the full appropriations process.\nOn the F-35 program, we continue to see strengthening customer demand both domestically and internationally. The Czech Republic has expressed interest in the aircraft, and Israel has formally decided to add 25 more F-35s, expanding their fleet by 50%. We delivered 50 F-35s in the first half of 2023, all of which were delivered in the Technology Refresh 2, or TR2, configuration. During the Q1 earnings call, we indicated that an anticipated reduction to 2023 deliveries from what we initially thought last year due to software maturation, acceptance, and certification related to the Technology Refresh 3, or TR3, configuration, and hardware delivery timing. Our current view is we expect to deliver 100 to 120 F-35 aircraft in 2023.\nImportantly, there is no change to our longer-term delivery outlook of 156 aircraft in 2025 in the foreseeable future, and the supply chain and production system continues to execute at a rate to support these future-year delivery targets. Our team remains fully dedicated to delivering the first TR3 aircraft in 2023. We have completed 58 flight tests on four different aircraft in the TR3 configuration, including a successful flight test for the most recent software release that happened in May. That software update brought in the next set of critical capabilities, such as upgraded data links, the new electro-optical targeting system, and radar. In the coming weeks and months, we will begin testing multi-ship missions, sensor fusion, and additional weapons, among other capabilities, as part of the next software release.\nTR3 significantly updates core processing power and memory capacity, as well as modernizes the computational core of the F-35 to enable Block 4 capabilities. It is a significant hardware and software upgrade that will greatly enhance the mission capability of the aircraft, which is on track to be the free world's predominant fighter for many decades into the future. Meanwhile, we are continuing the long tradition of leading the development of the next generation of military aviation, and this time with both piloted and unpiloted aircraft at our Skunk Works operation in California's high desert. Skunk Works just celebrated its 80th year anniversary in June. That's 80 years of pushing the innovation envelope from the U-2 in the 1950s that continues to fly today to the Mach 3+ SR-71 to pioneering stealth aircraft and beyond by advancing hypersonic, artificial intelligence, and other revolutionary technologies.\nSkunk Works continues to create exciting feats of engineering and goes beyond the edge of known science for our customers. A prime example today that we can discuss is our partnership with NASA to develop and build the X-59, the prototype that will quiet the supersonic boom and lead someday, perhaps, to supersonic commercial flights over land. This elegant and amazing airplane is advancing apace towards its first test flight. Our company's pioneering spirit has lived even longer in the world of rotorcraft and helicopters. At the Paris Air Show, Sikorsky celebrated its 100th anniversary. Yes, 100 years ago, Igor founded Sikorsky Aero Engineering Company on a chicken farm in Long Island, New York, with a small team of engineers and craftsmen, many of whom were immigrants like himself who fled the Russian Revolution.\nIn 1939, he brought his dream to reality when he piloted the first practical helicopter, the VS-300, as it left the ground for all of 10 seconds. His passion for innovation and perseverance to achieve his vision carry on in the Sikorsky culture today and throughout Lockheed Martin. Sikorsky's signature product line, the H-60 Black Hawk family of military helicopters, also perseveres around the world. The U.S. Department of State has approved a possible foreign military sale to Norway for six MH-60 Romeo multi-mission helicopters and related equipment, and Spain signed a letter of offer and acceptance for eight MH-60R Seahawk aircraft as well. We achieved several milestones in the quarter in support of other NATO allies as well. The German Air Force successfully launched a PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement, or MSE, interceptor from a German modified launcher.\nThis flight test was the last step before delivering PAC-3 MSE to Germany later this year. We also entered into an agreement with Rheinmetall Defense to collaborate on a unique rocket artillery system to be produced in Germany. Earlier in July, Rheinmetall selected a site in Germany to build a factory to manufacture F-35A center fuselages. This partnership, which was first announced in February between Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Rheinmetall, expands supply chain capacity for the F-35. Production is expected to start with our new German partner in 2025. In addition, our relationship with Poland continues to progress, with the first F-35 Lightning II for the Polish Air Force formally entering production and the initial shipment of HIMARS launchers to Poland. The U.S. State Department also approved a multi-billion-dollar potential foreign military sale to Poland for PAC-3 with modernized sensors and components.\nOn top of that, our partnership with Australia continues to advance as well. In April, as mentioned on our last earnings call, the Commonwealth of Australia selected Lockheed Martin as a preferred bidder for Project 9102, a sovereign military satellite communication system for the Australian Defense Force. We're excited at the prospect of deepening our relationship with a diverse team of Australian companies and helping establish Victoria as the engineering and technical hub for Australian defense. Also, at space, Lockheed Martin will be taking on a major role in Blue Origin's national team to develop and demonstrate a Human Lunar Landing System for the Artemis program. Our space operations will be building humanity's first Cislunar Transporter, which will enable recurring astronaut expeditions to the moon's surface and back from NASA's Gateway Space Station. Finally, we continue to advance our integrated 21st Century Security digital technology architecture during the quarter.\nIn May, as part of the US Indo-Pacific Command's Joint Fires Network, we successfully demonstrated digital command and control, or C2, to synchronize joint all-domain operations during the Northern Edge exercise near Alaska. The exercise demonstrated the ability to successfully integrate with both Lockheed Martin and third-party platforms and aircraft, including F-35s. The system performs C2 functions across all the military services, all levels of operation, and across multiple domains, from space to air to surface. This is the first time joint force synchronization has been demonstrated at this scale. It was a major milestone for all joint all-domain command and control interoperability and our company's vision for 21st-century security. The results of this demonstration will help shape future CJADC2 capabilities and continue Igor Sikorsky's and Skunk Works' pioneering legacy into the digital world.\nAlso, as part of the Northern Edge exercise, the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and RMS teams demonstrated the first use of artificial intelligence capabilities on a Stalker unmanned aircraft system for recognition and tracking of ships at sea. This capability showcased the value of using relatively cheap drones to greatly enhance the capability of and improve the survivability of much more valuable manned aircraft and ships. All these types of digital technology enhancements require reliable access to advanced semiconductors. In support of this crucial priority, I recently had the opportunity to join GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield and Senate Majority Leader Schumer to announce a collaboration that will advance US semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen resiliency within America's supply chain. This partnership enables us to more quickly and affordably produce 21st-century security technologies that increase deterrence for the United States and its allies.\nAlongside Senator Schumer and other leaders in industry, Congress, and the administration, we remain strongly supportive of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act signed into law last year. The Lockheed Martin team will work closely with GlobalFoundries as we expand our critical manufacturing line in New York and with our other semiconductor and tech industry partners across the country to ensure access to made-in-America microelectronics for our platforms and systems. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our consolidated results and business area performance for Q2 2023. I'll also provide an update to our full-year guidance. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings released today. Beginning on chart four, let's take a closer look at Q2 results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Q2 sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by aeronautics and space, both with double-digit growth in the quarter. This growth partly benefited from last year's $325 million impact from unrecognized F-35 sales. Excluding that benefit, sales were up 6% year-over-year, with Aero still up 12%. Segment operating profit was up 5% year-over-year, driven by the sales growth, which more than offset lower net favorable profit adjustments aligned to risk retirement timing.\nAs expected, segment margins were 11.1%. Moving to earnings per share on chart five, on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 6.5%, driven by higher profit and a lower share count, partially offset by increased interest expense. Moving to cash flow on chart six, we generated $771 million of free cash flow in the quarter, with nearly $330 million of capital expenditures. On a year-over-year basis, our free cash flow included $330 million of higher tax payments from the R&D capitalization legislation. Once again, dividends and share repurchases exceeded free cash flow in the quarter, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. For the first half of 2023, we have returned almost $2.8 billion, or 137% of free cash flow, through dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we issued $2 billion of debt across three tranches for a weighted coupon of 4.8%.\nWe had intended to raise the debt early in 2024 to support share repurchases, but accelerated the issuance to give us flexibility and coverage going into the debt ceiling negotiations. Okay, let's turn over to moving to the segment results, and starting with aeronautics on chart seven. Q2 sales at Aero increased $1 billion, driven by higher volume on the F-35, C-130, and classified programs. On F-35, we saw strong year-over-year growth in production and sustainment, with some of the favorability due to the previously mentioned impact in the Q2 of 2022 due to Lot 15 to 17 funding timing. Excluding that benefit, aeronautics was up 12%. Operating profit increased 17% over the prior year based on the higher sales. As Jim mentioned, we were pleased that the Joint Program Office exercised the next option, Lot 17, on the F-35 contract in the quarter.\nF-35 backlog now stands at 421 aircraft at the end of the quarter and offers longer-term clarity for our production operations and provides stability to our supply chain partners. Looking at missiles and fire control on page eight, sales were comparable to last year. Its higher sales volume on tactical strike missile programs were offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. As expected, segment operating profit and margins were down year-over-year, driven by lower net profit adjustments. MSC increased the backlog by $6.5 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a record $9 billion of orders in the quarter and a 3.3 Book-to-bill ratio. The order increases were broad-based across several of our key programs, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, JASSM/LRASM, and Javelin.\nAt Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven by lower volume on BLACK HAWK, as the program continues to transition from multi-year nine to multi-year ten. This decline was partially offset by favorable volume across several radar programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors. Operating profit decreased slightly due to lower sales volume and net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings. There were a few significant offsetting items that drove net profit adjustments down $40 million year-over-year. We recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program due to updated forecasts, partially offset by a $65 million benefit on an international airborne surveillance program.\nTurning to chart 10, in our space business area, sales were up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued development activity on the next-gen interceptor and classified programs, with additional upside coming from Orion. Operating profit increased 15%, and margins were up 30 basis points, driven by the increased volume and higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance year-over-year. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11, for the full year, we've increased our sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share outlook, while also tightening the ranges based on our strong year-to-date performance. At consolidated levels, sales are up $1 billion at the midpoint to $66.5 billion, allowing us to return to growth in 2023 earlier than previously anticipated. And segment operating profit is up $45 million at the midpoint to $7.35 billion.\nAt the business area level, we've increased Aero's outlook for sales by $250 million, with profit up $25 million, based on higher volume on F-35 sustainment and classified work at Skunk Works. As we mentioned previously, we expect minimal impact to our cost throughput in 2023 as a result of the lower F-35 aircraft deliveries. And while we expect there to be some pressure on cash collections, we are driving offset opportunities to make up any shortfalls. At space, we're raising the sales midpoint by $750 million on higher development volume and the profit midpoint by $20 million, as the benefit from higher sales is partially offset by a lower ULA earnings outlook. Lastly, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance at or above $6.2 billion and remain committed to $4 billion of share repurchases, with $2.7 billion in the back half for the year.\nWe continue to expect that these repurchases, along with dividends, will generate a return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. Looking at the 2023 earnings per share expectation changes on page 12, we've increased the EPS midpoint by $0.35, with the largest portion, $0.14, coming from improved business area profit. We expect $0.11 benefit from a lower share count, and we also expect a $0.06 benefit from a lower tax rate to 15% or about 20 basis points. The remaining $0.04 comes from a mix of miscellaneous offsetting items. Finally, on page 13, and to summarize and close out our comments, our first half results were strong, driving our return to growth a year earlier than anticipated and leading to the increased outlook for sales, profit, and EPS.\nOur backlog gives us confidence in our expected growth acceleration in 2024 and beyond. In addition, we remain committed to reward shareholders through industry-leading dividends and robust share repurchases. Finally, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives, 21st-century security, and One LMX, in order to transform our business and extend our industry leadership while delivering consistent and reliable shareholder returns. With that, Louise, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, and ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press one and zero on your touch-tone phone. You will hear an acknowledgment that you've been placed in queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the number. At the request of the host, please limit yourself to one question and re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero. One moment for our first question. That first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nSo Jim and Jay, you both talked a bit about the strong backlog expansion at MFC and how that helps the second half of this year, perhaps a bit earlier than expected. Wanted to see if you could get into a little more color on how that drives 2024 and beyond and how sustainable this is? And then lastly, Jay, can the rising volumes on some of these legacy programs mitigate that margin pressure from the classified work at MFC?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. If you look at where we are, and I'll go maybe take us back to, I think it was the Q4 call in January. I was asked about our outlook for 2024 growth, and at the time, what I said was to expect a low single-digit growth. And I think that that's just right now, we're going to park there, although that'll be on a higher base here in 2023 because 2023 is better. But we still need to go through and get a feel for what the supply chain performance clearly with the backlog. It's not a question of demand. It'll be a question of supply. We need to go through that analysis over the next few months and determine to what extent our growth outlook will change, if anything, from this baseline of low single-digit.\nIf anything, what I would say the backlog gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to return to growth. The demand signal itself would indicate a higher rate than low single-digit, but we need to wait and watch the supplies part of it to make sure that that can catch up to that demand. As far as the margin profile at MFC, we do expect there to be continued pressure over the next number of years. I would agree that some of this upside that we've seen in this incremental demand are from higher margin products and should provide some level of mitigation.\nBut we won't really get a feel for exactly what that means until, again, as we go through this over the next few months, as we understand specifically what contribution each of these different programs will have in 2024 and beyond, and what their timing will be, and what that mixed benefit may be.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAnd Rob, I can give you some long-term context here. So first, from a process perspective with the US government, there's multi-year procurement authority now for a whole set of Lockheed Martin products. And I'll just run through them really quick. It's Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, HIMARS, ATACMS, which is a longer-range GMLRS for the HIMARS, PAC-3 MSE, the GMLRS itself, which is the HIMARS primary munition, Javelin, LRASM, and JASSM. So all of those programs have multi-year procurement authorities. And so far, the GMLRS, PAC-3, LRASM, and JASSM are in pursuit of multi-year contracts with us currently already. And then if you look at the corpus, the Ukraine supplementals and what they're targeted for, the overall amount has been $62 billion in four bills to the DoD regarding Ukraine support.\nAbout 2/3 of that, or $44 billion, is for the purpose of restoring the presidential drawdown for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, essentially meaning the restocking of US munitions. Now, a lot of those munitions are going to be upgraded from what was in the stockpile to the capability that we can produce today. So that's another motivation for the US to go through with that. And we've derived that about $7 billion of those funds could be allocated to some of the Lockheed Martin programs that I just talked about. So there are significant long-term upside opportunities for our MFC business. And as Jay said, they're fairly high margin, and there's increasing international demand for a lot of those products too. So I think it's a really good long-term foundation for growth for the company.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on the commentary on Tech Refresh 3. Can you just touch on the cash impact of that? How big was that? How were you able to offset that and hold this year's guidance? And then, is it fair to assume additional deliveries above the 150 level for 2024 and cash benefit associated with that next year?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, Matt. So the impact on a per aircraft base is around $7 million per aircraft. So if you go to when we came into the year, we were expecting between our range was 147 to 153. So you go from the midpoint there off of 150, 30 aircraft would be a $210 million impact, and all the way down to 100 would be 50, about 350. So you're talking between $200 and 350 million impact to this year. As I mentioned, we're diligently working to manage that and offset it with tailwinds elsewhere in the portfolio. And to your point, to the extent that that does slip into next year, it's really a matter of timing. So yeah, it would, as we deliver aircraft, for those that slip into next year, we'll recover those remaining payments that are upon acceptance of the aircraft in 2024.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. Just as a, again, put it all in context, we could actually deliver more than 156 aircraft in 2024 because the factory is going to be producing at the rate of 156. So if there's some carryover, we might actually deliver more in 2024 than what the ongoing run rate will be because the factory will still be performing while those aircraft are waiting to be accepted. I just want to make sure that everybody knows what we're applying to this problem to make sure that we minimize it. This is the same conversation that I'm having with the seniors in military and civilian roles in government. So first of all, we and our suppliers are applying all the needed resources to this. It's a top priority for our company and a few others as well.\nWe're running extra shifts, and we're deploying subject matter experts into other companies or our suppliers' operations to make sure this stays on track. Flight test programs on schedule, and we've got the sufficient pilots both in the company and in the Department of Defense for acceptance as we move forward on all of that. And then finally, the purpose of the flight test program is to continuously narrow the funnel of testing of all the aircraft functions and mission capabilities in a really methodical fashion, a narrowing of funnel. And so we're just moving through that in a methodical way. Our latest estimate is that it'll all be completed by the end of Q4 of this year. Could it move a little bit into early 2024?\nYeah, it could, but we think we're on track to really get all the dimensions of resources, commitment, and schedule to give that option for the December delivery, everything we can.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYes, good morning, Jim and Jay. Jay, thanks for all the color on the F-35. I was wondering just regarding when we think about all the backlog growth that you have now. You've got a pretty big step up in CapEx this year, mid-teens growth. How are we thinking about just supporting the backlog? Are you expecting the CapEx profile to level off here, or do you expect that to increase, and maybe also related to how you're thinking about working capital in the same context? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, on the CapEx side, we definitely expect it to increase in the back half of the year. We're still holding our forecast of $1.95 billion for the year. And that's going to essentially stay elevated for the next few years. So a lot of that is investment in capacity and production capability, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks. And so we expect that to remain fairly level. On the working capital side, that for us is a source of opportunity. We expect that to really, what we're trying to do is take it back down to what we performed from a day's perspective over the past, say, 2020, 2021, and some period in 2022.\nAnd so while with increasing volumes, you would expect working capital to increase as well, we believe there's efficiency opportunities to perform at levels we've been able to perform in the past, and make that, at a minimum, not a use of cash. And if we're fully successful, make it a source of cash in spite of growth. And so that's our view, particularly in the back half of the year as well as over the next few years.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nI appreciate that. Thanks, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Jim and Jay. Thank you. So maybe just on space, given it drove your guidance raise, what drove the increased outlook? You called out $700 million of higher revenues related to development and space. Can you just give us a little bit of color there? Was it competitive wins or any more detail on what was driving that?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah, in many cases, Sheila, it's earlier than anticipated ramps on some of the programs. So the first half, we ran higher than we expected, and we were expecting to run at those levels in the back half of the year. This includes classified programs, also protected communications, international security space business, as well as an NGI in our strategic missile defense business within space. We've also had a little bit of growth in the Next-Gen GEO or the OPIR program. And so all of those together really drove the increase versus where we were coming into the year. Much of that we've really realized in the first half of the year with a little bit to come in the back half, but we had already planned ramping up those programs in the back half.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nMaria Ricciardone Lee\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you. The next question is from Rich Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nRich Safran\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nJim and Jay, Maria, good morning.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nRich Safran\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nGood morning. So there's been a lot of pressure on the F-35 and an engine upgrade both during and after Paris. I just want to know if you could clarify your remarks a bit, discuss where you stand on the new engine program. But also, I'd like to know what this means for Lockheed and for the F-35 in general since the engine, as I thought, was government-furnished equipment.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou're absolutely right, Rich. This is Jim here. It's government-furnished equipment. It's a decision of the US government as to what engine is selected for every block of aircraft and what modernization program goes along with that engine. So Lockheed Martin's role and responsibility in this is simply to receive the engine performance data from the manufacturers and their anticipated performance improvements, whether it's a modernization or a replacement option for the future. And then we translate that data to aircraft performance data and information that we then supply to our US government customers. And then we are available to answer questions for their decision-making process. So we were not involved in that decision-making process. And therefore, Lockheed Martin does not have a formal company position on engine selection or modernization. We implement the US government decision, and that's what we're doing now.\nSo that is very clearly our role and responsibility. Anything outside of that is not an official company position.\n\nRich Safran\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nThanks.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou got it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning, everyone.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nJay, we've talked about this dynamic where the outlays have lagged the authorization. In the second quarter, outlays finally grew a decent amount. Your revenue then grew at the fastest rate in a while organically year-over-year. I know in the back half, you have tougher comps, but the updated guidance and the revenue would have to be down in the back half organically. So I'm curious to hear you talk about: Is the outlay to authorization gap going to keep closing? Is supply chain or whatever else was impacting that resolved? And are you building guidance assuming that continues to close, or would that create upside if it were to play out that way?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, I think, Noah, the outlays will continue to increase. It's just a function of us. We always have a back half that is still higher than the first half. And that's still the case here. When you look at our overall sales in the back half sequentially versus the first half, it's about $1 billion higher. And a lot of that is in Aeronautics is going to be driving that. And so I would expect the outlays to continue to increase on an absolute basis over that period of time. The compares, it's a function where this year's sales are more level loaded than they were last year. So yes, we will have a step up in sales, but it won't be as significant as it was a year later or, I'm sorry, to last year.\nPart of that is, if you recall last year, we had the $325 million in the Q2 that slipped into the third quarter in 2022. We also had a late award on the F-35 program that we weren't anticipating in the fourth quarter. We were expecting that in the first quarter. We were able to convert pre-contract inventory to sales immediately in the quarter. So when you combine those, that in itself last year was about $500 million. So when you normalize for those things, much more of a level load year in 2023 versus 2022, it drives you to this, the compare just is going to be more difficult because on a year-over-year basis, last year in the fourth quarter, partly for these reasons, we had 7% growth in the Q4. So we won't see that.\nWe will see the back half of the year organically decline relative to the, from a year-over-year perspective, but again, still putting us a position to deliver growth a year earlier than we expected. And so it's just a function of our program timing. Yes, it's still higher, but just not at the ramp-up rate that we had in 2022.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. And Jay, pension on the cash flow statement, I think it's been a bit since you've updated the beyond 2023 contribution and cash recovery. Could you give us updated numbers for that?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. For cash contributions, right now, we're anticipating that we would have a required cash contribution in 2025, anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion. As I noted earlier in the call, our objective is to really offset that really through three things: more net income, cash-based net income contribution. We're going to see a tailwind in terms of dissipation of the R&D capitalization headwinds that we've seen. And it will also be driving working capital performance to a higher productivity level so that we can offset that. Our goal over this period of time is to continue to deliver a low single-digit free cash flow growth on an absolute basis. And that combined with our share repurchase program should result in a mid-single-digit free cash flow for share growth.\nSo that's our objective, not only over the next few years, really over a longer period of time as well. But that's really where we stand right now on pension contributions and how we're planning for it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Back in April, the DoD said the centrifuge size production was the limiter to higher production on the F-35 above 156 per year. So with Rheinmetall, excuse me, now it's signed up for fuselages starting in 2025. Can you talk about the upside towards the end of the decade above the 156 level as Rheinmetall steps up to maybe a 10% capacity?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nWell, that's one important element, Miles, of being able to expand past 156, but there are a lot of other elements that would have to be essentially funded between our suppliers, ourselves, and the US government to build the rate in the entire supply chain above the 156 level that we've all agreed on so far with the government. So if the demand continues for the aircraft, which it seems to be burgeoning continuously, and the US authorizes export of the aircraft to either more countries or in more numbers to existing countries, there might be a business case for the government and industry to go beyond the 156. The Rheinmetall fuselage size expansion will definitely be constructive to that, let's say.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nJust a clarification, despite the lower deliveries, you haven't slowed the production system on the F-35 on this Tier III issue, correct?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nNo, we haven't. So the whole production system, especially the long lead time parts, are tracking through the supply chain as if we're going on our ramp-up of between 140s and ultimately to 156. The deliveries will be that if there are delays of aircraft, will be fully completed aircraft on the ramp waiting for not even the software load, but the confirmation that the software load they have for Tier III passed all the flight test points. And that's really what they'll be \"waiting for.\" There won't be a production lag. There'll be just a delivery lag based on the completion of the software integration testing that has to be done in the air, not only on the aircraft, but among numerous aircraft flying together at the same time. That's what they'll be waiting for.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning, Jim and Jay. A two-part question, if I could, on the backlog. Can you first help us understand how much of the backlog growth is maybe directly Ukraine-related? And is there any risk to this based on either timing of the war or funding ultimately going to allied partners and put in place for the, obviously, for the restocking? And then as part of the long-term agreements you have in place on munitions and around a lot of this, how should we think about the potential positive margin impact from these longer-term agreements?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nI'll go with the backlog. Much of the backlog, particularly here what we saw in the second quarter, were essentially 23 contracting requirements. There was also GMLRS, which also included some 24 requirements. But as Jim mentioned, we're working towards multi-year contracting, but are not yet under any multi-year contracting agreements yet. And so what we've put into the backlog is pretty high confidence it's going to convert to sales. And so we're continuing to, as Jim mentioned, having a dialogue with the customer in terms of drawing multi-year requirements beyond that. As far as the margin in terms of long-term agreements, we essentially, in many cases, will enter into agreements with our supply chain over that period of time of these requirements. So we'll go back to back with our customer.\nSo as we enter into agreements with our customer that will cover multi-years, we will also get into contracts with our suppliers for those same multi-years. So any benefits that we get from that probably is going to drop through to our customer in favorable terms and pricing. So I wouldn't expect there to be any type of margin upside from where we are today. So I would expect consistent margins from those. But again, those are pretty solid.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jay.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everybody. Jim, I thought I'd give you an opportunity to maybe offer up some comments on the other segments. Jay, you talked a little bit about low single digits expectation in MFC. You could walk through the other segments as we move out into 2024 and beyond and your baseline assumptions for those at this point. And then also maybe talk a little bit about margins. You made some comments during the quarter about the 1LMX initiative that you have going on, particularly around supply chain and consolidating your purchasing and maybe getting some better purchasing power and pricing, and just how that's informing your outlook for margins in the future.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nOkay. So just I'll start with the growth rates in 2024 and beyond. Just to make sure I was clear, when I said low single digit, I meant for the entire company total consolidated sales. MFC should be significantly better than that, and we would expect them to be our highest growth segment. I'll go from there. The others, we'll see some growth from the remainders, but really the driver will be MFC over the next few years given this incremental demand that we've seen. On 1LMX, on the margins, this is an initiative for us, which is very significant. It's more than an ERP upgrade. It's our engineering tools, our product lifecycle tools. It's our manufacturing execution system tools. It's our customer relationship management tools, our HR system tools. And it's intended to make us a more competitive company.\nMany of those benefits that we are going to obtain, we will pass those through in pricing and our forward pricing rates to our customer. And so we won't necessarily see more of our margin benefit from it, but it'll make us more competitive to capture more business, stay in front of the industry, and maintain our leadership. And so that's the way we're approaching One LMX and really more of a financial view of it.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nSo fair to say then that margin outcomes will depend largely on mix going forward between development work and fixed price work?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. Yeah. I would say that's accurate. The mix will definitely be a factor in future margins.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nWanted to get an update on your position on Section 174, see if anything's changed there based on feedback you might have gotten from any of the tax authorities. And then second one, Aerojet, Lockheed or L3's potential acquisition thereof Aerojet. I think recently you've been out with some comments around that. Just your view and whether LHX has been able to or where they are in terms of being able to satisfy your concerns around that deal. Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSure. I'll take the Section 174 question. Over the past, I'd say, probably six months, the IRS has acknowledged that this is an issue they need to provide guidance to. We're hopeful that we'll see some guidance by the end of the year from them related to our position. There's been no change in our position there. And so we eagerly await any type of guidance that they may have. We still feel confident in the position that we've taken, and I've laid out in the past why we've taken our position that we have today. There has been some legislation proposed that could defer the implementation of Section 174 to 2026. It would be retroactive to 2022. So we're optimistic. Of course, we believe that it should be repealed, but at least a deferral would be a good start. And so we'll monitor that legislation.\nObviously, we're supportive of that, and we'll see how it works through Congress.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nAnd then when it comes to Aerojet Rocketdyne, we have two interests and only two. And those are the reliable access to propulsion, especially solid rocket motors, is of critical importance to the entire aerospace and defense industry. And so the two-sided benefit that we need to preserve of Aerojet Rocketdyne's current structure is that it's a merchant supplier of propulsion to the industry. And that means it treats all of the, I'll call them, prime contractors for the end products, the OEMs, equally. And that's what we feel we need to preserve even if AJRD goes into the ownership hands of another company. Secondly, the performance of AJRD has been improving, but it needs to get significantly better nonetheless.\nAnd so whether it's on its own or part of another company, it's really important that resources be applied to AJRD's operations so that it becomes a more capable supplier for on-time deliveries, quality, etc. So those are our two interests: maintaining the merchant supplier status and also having higher performance of the operations of that company. So we have not received any commitments from L3Harris at this time that would assure us that they are going to keep AJRD as a merchant supplier. And that's the one thing we really are looking for.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. That's very helpful.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYeah. Good morning, guys.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nGood morning, Ron.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nSo maybe a broader big-picture question here. As we look out to the fiscal 2024 budget and what was in fiscal 2023 and the trajectory, maybe even to fiscal 2025, in 2024, it looks like there's going to be maybe $6 billion or so of spending on classified aircraft programs, everything from NGAD, F/A-XX. There's been chatter about replacing U-2 with a hypersonic platform. I know you're limited in what you can say, but can you just give us a feel for what that means for Lockheed Martin, how you think about it? And as outsiders trying to model this and think about it, how would you guide us to think about it?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin",
    "content2": "What I'd start with there, Ron, is that we've got, in our experience, significant growth in our classified portfolio already. It's a bright spot for the company. I think recently we've been, when we aggregate all of our classified programs together, a 7% growth rate. So it is a place where, because of Skunk Works, our space operations, some segments of RMS and MFC even, where we have significant talent and capability to work in those really advanced spaces. I'd basically said in the preparatory parts, there are areas of this company where we are endeavoring to move into areas beyond known science to address what our customers' challenges are that they are facing. And so we have the capability to take advantage of a larger classified program growth rate on the part of government spending if that's what happens.\nSo we're in good shape to do that. There are missions that you need to differentiate, though, when it comes to aircraft, right? There's the reconnaissance and surveillance mission, right, which, a lot of it, can be done with unmanned systems. And that's one of the strengths of Skunk Works, for example. So that mission, we have a real strength in unmanned surveillance, ISR systems they're called. Then you've got the air superiority type of aircraft, right? So you could think about F-15, for example, F-22. NGAD is the next-generation air dominance aircraft. That is classified. The Air Force recently said that there is competition now beginning for that, or in training for that air dominance aircraft, that air superiority aircraft. And then there's the all-purpose strike aircraft, right? So that's F-16, F-35, those airplanes.\nAgain, where we have the advantage in F-35 is volume, right? We've got the committed volume for the strike mission in basically all three variants, right? So it's Air Force, which is a land-based long-runway solution. It's for the Marines, which is the B model, which is a land-based short-runway solution or amphibious takeoff and landing, or carrier takeoff and landing solution. And then you've got the C model, which is the pure Navy big carrier tailhook type of landing aircraft. So the capacity for the strike mission can and will be pursued through the F-35 in large part for the near future. So those are the ways to think about aircraft. So the classified programs are going to be largely in air superiority and ISR for the most part. And then there is the bomber mission, which is largely going to be carried out by the B-21 going forward.\nHopefully that's a bit helpful to your question there.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nJust running over the entire portfolio, the classified business for us is around $8 billion. If you recall, we had talked about it being one of the four pillars of our growth projection all the way through 2027. Our highest probably will be our programs of record, given what we've seen, particularly with MFC. But that'll be our second highest grower anywhere between mid- to high single-digit growth through 2027.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nGot it. All right. Thank you.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global Advisors\n\nYes, good morning. Can you guys talk about labor availability and cost just incrementally from last quarter? Has hiring become easier just in terms of hiring people? And then also wage rates, have you seen improvement there? Thanks.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin\n\nYeah. So we've actually, over the past six months, our labor availability has improved significantly. We have closed a lot of our key critical skill gaps over this period of time. And that partly has enabled the incremental sales growth that we've seen here in our change outlook because part of that is just our own internal labor. And so we're in a much better position than we were even six months ago. We've seen some lower attrition rates as well as better hiring rates as well. And so we're fairly confident that that will stick, and that also bodes well for the rest of the industry, particularly our supply chain. So we're encouraged by that.\n\nPete Skibitski\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global Advisors\n\nOkay. That's great. Appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you. I want to go back to missiles and fire control in Ukraine for a minute because if we think back to the early days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there were things like Javelin for you. There was, of course, Stingers. Everything looked like it would be a short-term need, potentially building out some capacity for replenishment of weapons. And so now we are more than a year later into this, and you've gotten some very big awards in this last quarter that appear to be related to Ukraine, either directly or other European needs. We're seeing NATO spending go up.\nCan you talk about how you view the opportunity in missiles and fire control for revenue and backlog ahead depending on how things may play out in Ukraine from if we saw the conflict come to a resolution or if we had increasing NATO involvement? How do you think about that in your planning?\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nSo I would say, qualitatively, and maybe turn it over to Jay for some quantification around it, that the tragedy of Ukraine has unveiled some issues and weaknesses for our national defense enterprise more broadly, right? I'm not convinced, Doug, that the duration of the Ukraine war, which we hope is very short, will affect our long-term prospects for MFC. But the lessons from this conflict will remain for many years. That's what I think is most important. The lessons are that great power conflict, first and foremost, unfortunately, has not gone from the world at this point in history. Russia's decision to invoke a major power land war on the European continent was pretty risky and demonstrates that they may take other risks in the future to sustain its regime or to expand its power, whatever the case and the motivation may be.\nSo NATO then, and when you talk to the defense ministers of countries like Poland and Lithuania, they are taking this extremely seriously, not for the short term, but for the long term. And so they are expanding their defense budgets, not because of what's going on necessarily on the ground in Ukraine right now; it's for the elevated risk that they perceive to their own countries for some foreseeable future, sadly. When it comes to the United States, the lesson, among others, of this situation in Ukraine, unfortunately, is that the expenditure rates of munitions is much higher than most of our existing war gaming models would imply. And therefore, there's a replenishment need for what's been used and what's been shipped to Ukraine.\nBut beyond that is the planning and hopefully deterrence of future conflicts where the US and its allies are going to need to, first of all, demonstrate to a potential adversary that they have the stockpiles to defend themselves for a long period of time if need be, and that the rates of munitions usage will be supportable from their stockpiles and from their industries. So we think this is a longer-term, essentially sea change in national defense strategy for the US and for our Western allies, including Japan, the Philippines, and others. So we hope the conflict in Ukraine ends quickly, but the lessons and the future demand for these kinds of products is going to stay elevated for a very long time, we think.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nThat appears consistent with the nature of these recent orders you've gotten that are large quantities, extend over a longer period of time than one might have thought.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nRight.\n\nMaria Ricciardone Lee\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Lockheed Martin\n\nAll right. Louise, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour here. So I'll turn it back to Jim for some final last thoughts.\n\nJim Taiclet\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lockheed Martin\n\nJust a couple of things. I wanted to make sure everybody understands that we're off to what I now think is a great start after three years of launching our 21st Century Security concept and strategy. It was really originally around proving and increasing deterrence to conflict by accelerating the adoption of digital technologies like 5G, distributed cloud, AI, international defense. And I think we're making huge progress on that. We've got a great set of partnerships with tech companies large and small to help us do that. And the customer is starting to adopt it. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're showing in major exercises, and we're getting some actual revenue and program awards around that. But we're going to expand that concept into two arenas based on this experience as we've had in the last three years.\nThe first one is to build and strengthen the defense production supply chain based on some of the things Doug, you just talked about. We're going to have to have a more resilient defense production system and one that can scale quickly if we have to. The other dimension is to make international production and sustainment operations a part of at least Lockheed Martin's future. So you hear us talk about investments in Australia, the UK, potentially Poland. Germany is new in this for us. We're going to continue to expand internationally to make sure we have a resilient supply chain and we have sustainment operations where our customers can use them to deter future conflict around the world. Those are some of the things I think are really important for y'all to understand where we're headed.\nBut before concluding the call, I really would like to thank all of my Lockheed Martin teammates for their many important contributions to strengthening our national security and increasing deterrence. And the strong financial and operational performance that we've been experiencing in this quarter was a result of their dedication and hard work. And look, whether it's on the factory floor, a classified engineering facility, or a customer flight line, our people showed up every day during the pandemic to do the job. And they continue to show up every day to do the job to provide for national security. So I want to thank them and also thank you all for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in October. Louise, that concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Ricciardone Lee\n\nVice President, Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations & Treasurer, Hubbell, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lois, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to Lockheed Martin's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today, on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements, and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nPlease see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially, from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, American Tower Corp.\n\nThanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to begin today with a few highlights from the quarter, as well as an overview of the presidential budget request, and then Jay will discuss our financial results and full year 2023 outlook in detail.\nWe had a solid start to the year with first quarter sales of $15.1 billion, led by 16% year-over-year growth at Space. Segment operating margin was 11.1% and led by MSE at 15.8%. Free cash flow grew 11% to $1.3 billion and combined with the lower share count contributed to a strong free cash flow per share growth year-over-year.\nWe remain on track to meet our financial expectations for the full year and the return to growth in 2024, as we laid out in January. In terms of capital deployment, we returned $1.3 billion or 101% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter. We remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing free cash flow per share and continue to plan to deliver approximately 110% of our free cash flow to stockholders in 2023, through dividends and buybacks.\nTurning to the budget. The administration released preliminary details of the FY '24 President's Budget Request, or PBR, in early March. This budget proposal reflects a heightened emphasis on defense and security cooperation with Allied. The FY '24 DoD budget request is $842 billion, an increase of $25 billion or 3% over the FY '23 enacted funding.\nThe near-peer threats posed by China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is driving the National Defense strategy and has created added demand for Lockheed Martin's advanced effective solutions. Key highlights include the procurement of 83 F-35 aircraft, continued expansion in classified programs and an increase in requested funding for munitions.\nThe PBR also includes facilitization investment and advanced funding for long lead time parts in support of multiyear procurement of JASSM and LRASM. We're also engaged with DoD on multiyear procurement proposals for PAC-3 MSE and guided multiple launch rocket systems. These proposals are subject to congressional approval during the course of the FY '24 defense authorization and appropriations process.\nThe PBR also includes continued investments in key technology development efforts, such as Conventional Prompt Strike, long-range hypersonic weapon, Next Generation Interceptor, hypersonic defense, Wan Defense System and other Space programs. Furthermore, key technology areas aligned with Lockheed Martin investment priorities received increased funding to include microelectronics, 5G technologies and joint all-domain operations.\nWe are encouraged by this initial request and look forward to its progression through the authorization and appropriations process. We also anticipate heightened emphasis on National Security prioritization from Congress, supplemental spending requests, including Ukraine and elevated demand from Allies and partners. Turning to the F-35 program. The 83 F-35 Lightning 2 aircraft included in the PBR signals strong support from the services and the administration.\nMoreover, the Canadian government's January announcement that it will procure 88 F-35s, marks another milestone in continued international demand for the aircraft. As to production, deliveries of F-35 engines, which are government-furnished equipment resumed in February. And then flight operations and deliveries resumed in March.\nHowever, we do expect a fraction of total expected 2023 deliveries to be impacted later this year, due to both software maturation related to Technology Refresh 3 or TR3 and hardware delivery timing. However, we anticipate little to no revenue impact from any potential delivery delay, and therefore, no material adverse effect on our 2023 P&L.\nJay will provide some more color on this, in a moment. Also at Aeronautics, the first Greenville built F-16 Block 70 took flight and was delivered to Bahrain. In addition to the Bahrain customer, 6 countries have selected Block 70 or 72 aircraft and Jordan and Bulgaria have signed letters of agreement for additional jets. Further related to the F-16 in the quarter, while I was at the U.S.-India CEO Forum in March, I had the privilege to announce the memorandum of understanding with the Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Limited joint venture to produce F-16 wing structures in India, demonstrating our commitment to India as an industry partner and customer while bolstering our supply chain.\nTurning to hypersonics, it is encouraging to see the continued investment outlined in the PBR for the Conventional Prompt Strike Weapon System or CPS, as it begins integration and testing for Zumwalt-class ships, recognizing our advancements in this critical technology. In February, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin, an initial contract for CPS, the first sea-based hypersonic strike capability for the United States, enabling long-range missile flight at speeds greater than Mach 5.\nFirst delivery is expected by the mid-2020s. Regarding our Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, also known as ARRW, we are continuing testing of the system at hypersonic speeds in order to advance technical maturation of the missile and the glide body, and to ensure the final product is safe, reliable and supportive of our customers' missions and future plans. In January, we also completed the second flight test of hypersonic air breathing weapons concept also known as HAWC in partnership with DARPA and the Air Force Research Lab. We accomplished all the test objectives during the second flight test, including affordable rapid development and performance requirements. And in late March, the U.S. Navy announced its support of the hypersonic air-launched offensive anti-surface Strike Weapon, or HALO. Lockheed Martin was down selected and awarded a contract for the first step to fielding a critical capability over the next decade, and begin the design and development of a carrier-based air-breathing hypersonic strike capability for the Navy's fleet.\nAs a company, we remain fully committed to developing hypersonic technology on accelerated time lines to meet this critical national security need and establish a solid deterrent posture in this area for the U.S. and its allies. The hypersonic solutions are just one element in our vision of 21st Century Security. We advanced several additional aspects of this strategy during the quarter, including announcing a memorandum of understanding with Juniper Networks to jointly develop integrated hybrid software-defined wide area network solutions and to demonstrate that with our customers in the future.\nThis technology enables mission aware dynamic routing, a foundational capability for resilient joint all-domain operations. This mission -- aware dynamic routing shifts the movement of data and communications in real time across a mix of military and commercial infrastructure according to evolving conditions. Our solutions give customers the flexibility to rapidly adapt to maintain the flow of crucial data and information as their assets operate in contested environments.\nWe also led simulations of technologies to the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy to demonstrate the impacts of 5G communications and advanced analytics to significantly improve operations and maintenance performance for a variety of aircraft. As well as for unmanned platforms and operationally challenging environments. And at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to deliver a keynote address and meet with CEOs across the digital technology, mobile and networking industries to encourage us working together to promote innovative solutions to protect our countries and advance our space exploration capabilities.\nAnother example of our leadership in accelerating advanced 21st Century technologies to improve national defense and deterrence to conflict is in the arena of directed energy. Recently, our RMS unit achieved success in our initial test of our demos, high-energy laser, which verifies that the lasers optical performance meets the systems targeted design parameters. This 50-kilowatt class laser weapon system aligns with the Army's directed energy short-range air defense mission.\nIn addition to delivering on absolutely cutting-edge technologies, demand for many of our well-known and long time performing systems continues to be strong. For example, in January, the Australian government announced the purchase of 20 Lockheed Martin, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or the now familiar high marks, providing Australian defense force with a reliable well-proven capability. And we continue to grow our significant partnership with Australia beyond high marks. In February, an agreement was announced between the Australian and United States governments for a foreign military sale of 40 UH-60M Black Hawks for the Australian Army and deliveries are slated to begin, early this year.\nThe Black Hawk remains unmatched as an all-around multi-role durable military helicopter for Australia and for the 34 other countries, around the globe that use it. Further, we're excited to work with the ADF and Australian industry to develop sovereign satellite communications component otherwise known there as joint Project 9102. The Commonwealth of Australia announced in April that Lockheed Martin was selected as the preferred bidder for JP9102.\nThis multibillion-dollar project will provide the ADF with a robust solution for military satellite communications and defined by its versatility and its resilience. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\n\nJesus Malave\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated and business area results for the first quarter and cover our 2023 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated financial results.\nOverall, 2023 is off to a solid start positioning us well to meet our commitments for the year. We delivered just over $15 billion of sales with $1.7 billion in segment operating profit, resulting in 11.1% segment operating margin. Earnings per share was $6.61, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, enabling a solid shareholder return through share repurchases and dividends. Our book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter was 0.7 as anticipated, with backlog expected to increase in the second quarter from the upcoming order for F-35 Lot 17 production.\nAnd we continue to strategically invest in our growth strategy with $600 million of capital expenditures and independent research and development this quarter. These financial results are on track with our expectations for the year. Taking a closer look at the quarter's results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart 4, first quarter sales increased year-over-year by 1% a Space led the way with 16% growth.\nSegment operating profit was down 2% as lower ULA equity earnings and contract mix more than offset the benefits from slightly higher volume and step-ups. As expected, margins contracted mostly due to the lower equity earnings from ULA. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP earnings per share were up $0.17 or 3% over 2022. Adjusted for mark-to-market investment gains, EPS was flat. On an adjusted basis, the unfavorable year-over-year impacts from segment operating profit, interest expense and FAS/CAS pension income were offset by the lower share count.\nMoving to cash flow on Chart 6. We generated nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, including nearly $300 million of capital expenditures as well as over $600 million of accelerated payments and continued support of the supply chain. Our cash deployment plan is on track which we expect to accelerate throughout the year.\nIn the quarter, we had $500 million of share repurchases and paid almost $800 million in quarterly dividends. Total cash returned to shareholders in the quarter was 101% of free cash flow. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. First quarter sales at ARRW decreased 2% year-over-year. Lower F-35 production sales were partially offset by higher F-16 and classified program volumes.\nOperating profit was slightly lower than prior year, as the impact from lower net profit adjustments and sales volume was partially offset by favorable contract mix. For the year, we expect F-35 deliveries to be lower than previously anticipated due to software maturation with the Tech Refresh 3 program and hardware delivery timing. We will refine the impact as the year progresses, but do not expect to change to ARRW 2023 sales and profit ranges that we had previously communicated in January. As we maintain our production cost throughput profile for the year.\nLooking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales decreased 3%, as lower sales volume on sensors and global sustainment, as well as our tactical strike missile programs were partially offset by growth in integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit was down 2%, driven by lower sales volumes and net profit adjustments partially offset by favorable contract mix. At Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9, sales were down 1% from 2022, driven by lower volume on Black Hawk production and our C6ISR programs.\nThese declines were partially offset by favorable volume on RADAR programs, in Integrated Warfare Systems And Sensors, including Defense of Guam, an important growth area for RMS that was won in 2022. Operating profit decreased 14% due to lower sales volumes and timing of net profit adjustments.\nTurning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales were up 16% in the quarter, driven by strong growth on the Next Gen Interceptor and classified programs and further boosted by favorable program life cycle timing on Orion, Protected Communications and Fleet Ballistic Missile Programs.\nOperating profit was up 13%, driven by the increase in volume and favorable profit adjustments partially offset by the lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on Page 11. For the year, we are reaffirming guidance for all key metrics. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion with segment operating margin at 11.2% at the midpoint.\nWe also still expect to deliver free cash flow at or above $6.2 billion while repurchasing $4 billion of outstanding shares. We believe our first quarter results position us to achieve these expectations, as we continue to add orders, be program execution commitments and pursue new opportunities throughout the year. All right. So let's close on Page 12 to summarize the comments.\nAs noted, first quarter represents a solid start to 2023. We reaffirm key financial metrics as previously guided and continue to expect a return to growth in 2024 and beyond, with consistent free cash flow per share growth. Looking ahead, our strategic focus on 21st Century Security solutions aligns with expected increases to defense and security spending.\nWith our continued discipline and focus on execution, we are on track to meet our expectations for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Ricciardone Lee\n\nThank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call.

Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Hope you've all had a good start to the new year, and I thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2023.\nI'd like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and from the year, and then Jay will review the financials in a more detailed manner. Lockheed Martin had a strong close to 2022. All of our business areas met or exceeded our prior expectations, resulting in a 2022 full year sales of $66 billion, segment operating profit of $7.2 billion and earnings per share of $21.66.\nOur free cash flow for the year of $6.1 billion also came in above our prior expectation, while backlog for the year increased to $150 billion, driven by all-time record orders for Lockheed Martin. Our financial results included more than $1.7 billion of independent research and development investments, or IRAD, a new high watermark for the company. We also continue to modernize and streamline our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.\nSignificant capital projects include our ongoing investment in what we call One Lockheed Martin transformation or 1LMX. This is our multiyear internal project to transform our business processes and systems from end to end. By implementing new digital tools in our operations and expanding our use of model-based engineering to enhance our speed to market and our cost competitiveness.\nIn 2022, we completed a majority of the detail design for our new systems and business processes. And for 2023, we expect to complete the detailed design and implementation road maps that go with it, and then we'll transition to the system build and configuration phase over the next couple of years.\nThese IRAD and capital investments accelerate the capabilities our customers need and for our operations to efficiently and effectively meet those needs. From a capital return perspective, we delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 via share repurchases of $7.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.\nDuring the fourth quarter specifically, we entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we've retired approximately 7 million shares under that agreement so far. We expect to complete our remaining repurchase authorization of $10 billion over the next few years, consistent with our focus to deliver free cash flow per share growth to you, the investor. These operational and financial results created significant value for our shareholders, ending the year with a total shareholder return of 40%.\nI will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense, or DoD, budget. In late December, Congress signed the FY '23 OMNIBUS spending bill into law, appropriating $858 billion for national defense, including $817 billion for the DoD-based budget. This reflects approximately 10% growth year-over-year for both national defense and the DoD-based budget.\nThe law also represents a 6% or $45 billion increase from the President's budget request for DoD.\nThese appropriations enabled us, along with the Joint Program Office, to finalize the contract for the production and delivery of up to 398 F-35s for $30 billion in Lots 15 and 16, including the option for Lot 17. Further, several other of Lockheed Martin programs received the funding levels necessary to drive the growth outlook we previously identified, including our Combat Rescue Helicopter, the C-130J, Black Hawk, CH-53K and FAAD. We view this funding outcome as positive for the future, and our current expectation is that growth will materialize over the longer term, starting in 2024.\nLet's now turn to the 4 growth pillars: programs of record, hypersonics, classified activities and new awards. With regard to programs of record, there were several important developments in key signature programs in our fourth quarter. On the F-35, the definitization of Lots 15 through 17, as I mentioned a minute ago, included the first F-35 aircraft to be produced for Belgium, Finland and Poland. We received authorization to procure long lead items for Lot 18 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. allies as well.\nWe also formally welcome Germany, the ninth foreign military sales country, to the F-35 Lightning II program. And earlier in January, Canada officially became an F-35 operator as the country selected the aircraft to replace its aging fighter fleet.\nWe continue to expect deliveries of the F-35 to ramp to 156 by 2025. Despite the temporary pause in flight operations and corresponding suspension of engine deliveries that began in December and resulted in the delivery of just 141 F-35s in 2022, 7 shy of our expectation of 148 before the engine issue was discovered.\nAlso in the quarter, the U.S. Navy authorized the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter to enter full rate production and then its deployment phase. This important milestone allows the program to proceed beyond low-rate initial production. And this achievement attests to our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps and instills confidence and stability in Sikorsky's diverse domestic supply chain.\nIn addition, at Sikorsky, international demand for the Black Hawk remains strong. Last week, the Australian Army announced it will acquire 40 UH-60M BLACK HAWK helicopters to replace its current multi-role helicopter fleet. Deliveries are expected to begin for Australia this year.\nFurther, the Lockheed Martin built Orion exploration class spacecraft launched on NASA's Artemis 1 and completed a 25-day flight test, slashing down off the coast of California. This successful mission takes us one step closer to the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon.\nOn its journey, Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles through deep space and surpassed records for total distance. It traveled 270,000 miles from home and the farthest distance from earth by a spacecraft designed to carry humans. We look forward to the next stages of the program with 7 additional missions under contract.\nTurning to hypersonics. In December, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted a hypersonic-boosted flight test of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon. This was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile, meeting all its objectives for the test, including reaching speeds of greater than 5x the speed of sound.\nWith regard to classified programs, we achieved successful milestones across multiple business areas in 2022 and grew 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in classified that will outpace the rest of the portfolio over the next several years.\nAnd finally, at new awards, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor, or NGI, continues to make progress. In late October, we announced the delivery of the first NGI flight software package to the Missile Defense Agency, providing the framework of software development tools, process workflows, scripts and environments. The delivery was ahead of schedule and is a critical step on the path for flight testing and fielding. This program remains a focused competition for Lockheed Martin with the first NGI forecast for delivery in 2027.\nWith regard to the future long-range assault aircraft, or FLRAA, competition, we were disappointed in the U.S. Army's decision. And upon review, we determined a formal protest by Sikorsky on behalf of team Defiant to be the best course of action. We continue to believe that DEFIANT X with its increased speed, range, maneuverability and survivability is the transformational and most cost-effective aircraft that best meets the selection criteria for this competition.\nSikorsky remains 1 of 2 competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative that's called the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, which is currently expected to be awarded in 2025. The first RAIDER X competitive prototype is over 90% complete and has more than 65% of its acceptance test procedures already done. Sikorsky is the only company with a representative FARA technology demonstrator aircraft. I saw it fly down at West Palm Beach a few months ago. It's amazing, the S-97 Raider, which has completed more than 110 flight hours.\nIn November, Norway became the first international customer for our new TPY-4 Radar. It's the first software-defined Radar that outperforms in target detection, mission diversity and transportability. Norway is going to receive 8 of Lockheed Martin's TPY-4 Radars with options for 3 additional Radars.\nFinally, backlog ended 2022 at $150 billion with book-to-bill of 1.2x and increases in every business area across Lockheed Martin. This strong demand signal bodes well for future growth over the longer term for our company. So these 4 pillars will guide us as we face a challenging geopolitical environment and apply growth and integrated capabilities mindset to everything we do here.\nAs conflict continues in Ukraine, unfortunately, and projected global threats require coordinated efforts to protect the U.S. and our allied territories, ongoing progress in our 21st Century Security vision will enable the acceleration of advanced capabilities to deter these threats and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations for our military service customers.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued to announce and expand strategic agreements with America's leading commercial digital companies, such as IBM's Red Hat, to advance artificial intelligence innovation on Lockheed Martin military platforms. And for Microsoft, with whom we're going to help power classified cloud advanced technologies for the Department of Defense. Microsoft's latest secure framework will make Lockheed Martin the first nongovernment entity to independently operate inside the Microsoft Azure Government Secret Cloud, ushering in a new era of cloud opportunities for the industry.\nAs we look ahead, demand for Lockheed Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United States and abroad. We continue to expect 2023 sales about the same level as we discussed back in October. We also continue to expect a return to sustained top line growth in 2024 and beyond as headwinds diminish in our program mix, the supply chain continues to recover and our signature programs grow.\nFree cash flow per share will remain a key focus as we maximize returns for you, our shareholders. 2022 is a year of great accomplishments for our company in the face of a lot of dynamic challenges. The outstanding achievements of our teams resulted from real deep commitments across our business areas and better cooperation among them as well as our corporate functions to develop, produce and deliver world-class systems to our country and its allies. Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 116,000 team members and the values we all share.\nSo with that, let me hand it off to Jay to give more color on the financials, and we'll join you later to answer your questions. Jay?\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results for 2022, additional business area detail and offer a first full look at 2023 guidance. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today.\nLet's begin with Chart 3, an overview of our consolidated 2022 financials. Lockheed Martin followed up a solid third quarter with a strong finish to 2022, highlighted by 7% year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter and effectively managed a turbulent year impacted by COVID and supply chain disruptions as well as inflation levels not seen in decades.\nBesides sales, we also exceeded our expectations for segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow, all while absorbing incremental headwinds tied to restructuring activities within RMS and mark-to-market losses in our investment portfolios. We also booked record orders in 2022, resulting in 11% growth to an ending backlog of $150 billion.\nIn addition to our orders on F-35, we experienced a surge in new interest for our industry-leading security solutions, such as in classified programs in Space and in Missiles and Fire Control, where we booked approximately $1.5 billion in orders, reflecting increased demand to replenish U.S. stocks and enhance security positions globally. And we delivered on our commitment to boost shareholder returns by deploying nearly $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making significant investments in our businesses.\nTaken together, these results demonstrate the perseverance of our dedicated employees to perform in challenging environments and support our expectations for 2023 and beyond.\nTaking a closer look at full year results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart 4. Sales came in higher than expected by nearly $750 million, limiting the decline to 2% year-over-year and essentially recovering to the sales guidance we had originally communicated last January. The stronger-than-expected performance was broad-based across all 4 business areas and reflects strong coordination with supplier partners to drive material throughput and program schedule performance as well as some favorable award timing, which drove additional revenue.\nSegment operating profit declined 2% year-over-year but also finished higher than expected by almost $50 million driven by the higher sales. Operating margins settled at 10.9%, slightly lower year-over-year and versus expectations based on lower net favorable profit adjustments.\nMoving to earnings per share on Chart 5. Adjusted earnings per share grew 2% for the year as the benefit from share repurchases overcame headwinds from lower segment profit and FAS/CAS pension income.\nMoving to cash flow on Chart 6. We delivered $6.1 billion of free cash flow for the year while investing almost $1.7 billion in CapEx at a ratio of 1.4x depreciation. We also ended the year with nearly $1.5 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers, maintaining our commitment to a resilient supply chain.\nAs I noted earlier, 2022 represented a significant year of cash deployment. In total, we returned 178% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022, leveraging our performance and strong balance sheet while still investing for our anticipated growth trajectory in 2024 and beyond.\nOkay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Full year sales grew 1% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in our classified programs, partially offset by lower F-35 production volume. Operating profit increased 2% driven by higher net favorable profit adjustments more than offsetting the impact of the lower volume. For the year, backlog at Aeronautics grew 15%.\nAs mentioned, Aeronautics completed the F-35 Lot 15 through 17 negotiation and secured production volumes while providing the services with a value proposition that combines the highest performance at affordable cost.\nLooking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales decreased 3% driven primarily by lower volume on our special ops sustainment program following the Afghan withdrawal, along with lower volume on sensors programs. Segment operating profit was down 1% with lower favorable profit adjustments primarily on PAC-3. For the year, backlog increased 6% on the back of tactical missile strength.\nAt Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9, sales decreased year-over-year by 4% driven primarily by a nonrecurring revenue event in our training business in 2021 along with lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 7%, following Sikorsky and C6ISR volume and lower favorable profit adjustments on the Black Hawk program.\nBacklog grew 4% in 2022, led by the Defense of Guam award, where RMS will be the lead integrator of the multi-domain air and missile defense system as well as stronger Sikorsky orders.\nTurning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales decreased 2% due to the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program, partially offset by growth on a Next Generation Interceptor program and national security space. Operating profit decreased 8% with lower net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Backlog grew 16% based on strong classified program captures and Orion orders. So all told, a strong finish to the year.\nSo let's now shift to 2023 on Page 11. Before introducing our expectations, I'd like to inform you of a reporting change in segment operating profit starting in 2023. We will report purchased intangible asset amortization expense in unallocated corporate expense below segment operating profit. Previously, intangible amortization was included in segment operating profit. This change will not impact total earnings, and we believe the change provides a more accurate view of operating performance for each of our 4 business areas. The impact is approximately 40 basis points on our 2023 expectations, consistent with the impact in previous years.\nOur 2023 financial outlook includes the impact of this change, and you can find supporting data for these adjustments in the appendices of our web charts as well as in the earnings release.\nOkay. Let's get into the outlook for 2023. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion and the midpoint is slightly below 2022. Speaking to the timing of sales this year, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year, ramping up quarter-over-quarter as we did in 2022.\nSegment operating profit for 2023 normalized for intangible asset amortization has improved what we thought -- from what we thought in October. And we now estimate only 10 basis points of headwind from 2022 with segment operating margins at 11.1% under our new reporting.\nWe currently expect $2.1 billion of FAS/CAS income in 2023. It's estimated to be roughly $100 million lower in '22, excluding the impact from our pension transfer transaction.\nOur earnings per share is expected to be between $26.60 and $26.90 for '23 with the year-over-year reduction to adjusted EPS primarily driven by lower segment operating profit in FAS/CAS income, partially offset by the benefit from a lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2023 is greater to or equal than $6.2 billion and assumes continued enactment of the R&D tax capitalization. This increase of $100 million to cash generation, along with our share repurchase guide of another $4 billion, highlights our continued focus on increasing free cash flow per share for our shareholders. This projected combination of higher free cash flow and a lower share count lead to a mid-single-digit growth expectation in free cash flow per share in 2023.\nOkay. On Chart 20 -- on Chart 12, let's sum it all up. We closed out 2022 with a strong finish with operating momentum and a robust backlog, which have us well positioned to resume growth in 2024 and beyond. We also placed a premium on leveraging our strong cash generation and balance sheet to increase cash returns to our shareholders with a significant increase to share repurchases.\nAcross all 4 business areas, our breadth of development, production and sustainment programs continue to drive a foundation of growth and sustained high performance. And we will work actively with our customers to meet their increasing demands and mission requirements looking ahead to the future. Our investments for growth, value and efficiency are aligned with our strategy for technology advancement and improved synergies across Lockheed Martin.\nSo in closing, we believe the business is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGreg Gardner\n\nVP of IR, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer; and Maria Ricciardone Lee, our new Vice President of Investor Relations.\nStatements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.\nWe have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our quarterly results, our 2022 full year outlook and our preliminary expectations for 2023. But before we begin, I'd like to welcome Maria who I'm excited to tell you all started as our new Vice President of Investor Relations just yesterday.\nI'd also like to thank Greg who announced his plan to retire at the end of the year for his more than 37 years of dedicated service at Lockheed Martin, including 5 terrific years as our Vice President of Investor Relations. It's been a pleasure to work with you, Greg, and we wish you all the best in retirement.\n\nGreg Gardner\n\nVP of IR, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nI'd also like to note that we continue to await the U.S. Army's selection for its future long-range assault aircraft competition, FLRAA, as it is known. We'll modernize the Army's rotorcraft fleet and represent a long-term franchise growth opportunity. We are confident that the Defiant X is the transformational aircraft that the U.S. Army is going to need to accomplish its complex missions today and well into the future, and we look forward to the Army's announcement.\nLockheed Martin had a solid quarter financially with 3% increase in sales from last year's third quarter and strong operating margins and earnings per share. Our free cash flow was outstanding as we generated $2.7 billion in the quarter. And our backlog grew nearly $5 billion, closing at $140 billion. We remain on track to achieve the full year outlook for all of our financial metrics that we discussed last quarter.\nIn a few minutes, Jay will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2022 guidance and trending information. But before he does that, I will provide a framework for our outlook and discuss our plans for delivering value to customers and shareholders over the next several years.\nWe continue to anticipate growth over the long term. But with residual pandemic impacts and supply chain challenges continuing, we now expect to return to growth in 2024 with 2023 sales being approximately equal to our 2022 outlook. We are confident in our 4 pillars to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Importantly, we expect to deliver solid growth in free cash flow per share in 2023 and thereafter through a combination of cost reductions throughout the business, improved working capital management and an expanded share repurchase program.\nOur Board of Directors has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion. You will see in Jay's charts that we're doubling our share repurchase plan outlook for this year, increasing our outlook by $4 billion for a total expectation of $8 billion in 2022. We also announced a 7% dividend increase this quarter. So altogether, we're on track to deliver approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022.\nWe are also elevating our commitment to drive long-term growth through strong, independent research and development and capital expenditure funding with an expected total of nearly $4 billion in 2023. These investments will support our customers and deliver on our 21st Century Security vision to accelerate leading-edge commercial digital technologies in defense of our nation and allies.\nA key driver of this strategy is our new 1LM transformation, or as we call it, 1LMX, a multibillion-dollar, 7-year, company-wide program to transform our end-to-end business processes and systems. 1 will create a model-based enterprise with a fully integrated digital thread throughout the design, build and sustain product life cycle. And part -- as part of our ongoing corporate stewardship approach -- we are conducting an internal review to identify potential synergies between our 4 business areas, further cost-reduction opportunities and a general portfolio review with the goal of increasing operating efficiency in anticipation of our future growth. We are confident in long-term growth as domestic and international demand for a wide range of our products and services remain strong. We will continue to actively reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers' requirements and drive organic growth. And we will use our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process and strong balance sheet to drive attractive total returns for shareholders.\nMoving on, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments from each of our business areas, beginning with an update on our F-35 program. Last month, the Swiss government signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the procurement of 36 F-35As. This milestone completes the government to government procurement process that was first announced in June 2021 when the Swiss Federal Council shared its selection of the F-35 for its future fighter. The signing officially makes Switzerland the 15th F-35 customer. Also in August, we received contractual authorization from the Joint Program Office, enabling us to book a Lot 15 order of over $7.5 billion in recognized revenues and earnings from the second quarter as well as from the third quarter.\nOur Space team celebrated the successful launch and deployment of the space-based infrared system GEO 6 satellite, the final spacecraft in the SIBRS constellation. SIBRS has been one of our longest running signature programs, providing the space force with an integrated system for missile warning, battle space awareness and intelligence gathering. We will also continue to support and advance this important mission through our next-generation overhead persistent infrared, or Next Gen OPIR program, which will deliver even more advanced and more survivable missile warning capabilities to the country.\nAt Rotary and Mission Systems, the Sikorsky line of business secured an order for 12 SEAHAWK helicopters from the Australian Ministry of Defense. Over the past 40 years, we've delivered over 1,000 SEAHAWKs to the U.S. and international customers both with more than 50 remaining in backlog. And in missile and fire control, the State Department approved a potential sale to the United Arab Emirates for 2 THAAD systems, including 96 interceptors. The UAE currently operates 2 THAAD batteries, and this opportunity would significantly increase their air and missile defense capabilities. And once finalized, could be worth over $2.2 billion.\nTurning to budgets. Both chambers of Congress have advanced appropriation bills in support of fiscal year 2023 Department of Defense budgets. We have seen strong bipartisan support for increased defense funding and congressional authorization and appropriation committees. Final legislation approving these funds has yet to be passed, and the federal government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution for FY '23, limiting DoD funding to prior FY 2022 levels.\nAs part of the continuing resolution, Congress did approve additional supplemental spending to support efforts in Ukraine for the defense of their country. The CR added $3 billion in funding for Ukraine security assistance initiatives, a program to provide equipment, weapons and military support to Ukraine, bringing the total amount appropriated for this effort to $9 billion.\nIn addition, the continuing resolution appropriated $2 billion to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine and to increase production of critical munitions with the presidential drawdown authority funding now having been increased to over $14 billion since the beginning of the year.\nThe international community has also increased their focus on global security with nations across the world having announced a planned 5-year increase in defense budget funding of approximately $60 billion in total. We continue to have discussions with customers to expand the manufacturing of multiple products and have submitted offers for consideration. While many of these contracting actions remain in the early stages and may take time to be fully implemented, we believe our signature programs and 21st Century Security technologies have us well positioned to address the challenges presented by a resurgence in global great power competition.\nTurning to our 21st Century Security strategy. I'd like to highlight 2 examples of Lockheed Martin's leadership in deterrence technologies and how our 5G.MIL open architecture can be used to enhance performance and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations. During the third quarter, Lockheed Martin and AT&T teamed to transfer UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter flight and performance data from an aircraft flying in Connecticut to receiving location in Colorado using both an AT&T 5G private cellular network and Lockheed Martin's 5G.MIL multisite pilot network. Operational performance has also improved with the efficiencies introduced by this technology shortening the total processing time of the task by nearly 85%.\nAlso this quarter, Lockheed Martin and Verizon flew 5G-enabled drones to capture and securely transfer high-speed, real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data from aircraft in flight to geolocate simulated adversarial positios. This demonstration showed the capabilities of our hybrid base station to bridge commercial and military technologies together, providing our service members with enhanced deterrent capabilities and further enabling the mission all the way out to the actual battlefield.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.\nJay Malave;Chief Financial Officer^ Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail, provide an update to our 2022 outlook as well as offer some thoughts on 2023 and beyond. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today.\nLet's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated third quarter financials. Lockheed Martin delivered solid results for the quarter. To start, we generated sequential sales growth of 7% to $16.6 billion as anticipated. Segment operating profit was $1.9 billion at an 11.2% margin with earnings per share of $6.71, reflecting solid underlying performance that absorbed $0.16 of mark-to-market headwinds. We also increased backlog with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio, driven by the F-35 production Lot 15 contract action. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $2.7 billion, further enabling the execution of our disciplined and dynamic cash deployment strategy and returning over $2 billion through share repurchases and dividends.\nTurning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on Chart 4. Total sales increased 3% from the third quarter of 2021 with growth in 3 of our 4 business areas. Segment operating profit was up slightly as the benefits from higher volume and equity earnings more than offset lower step-ups than last year.\nMoving to earnings per share on Chart 5. On a reported basis, earnings per share were higher by $4.50. Adjusting for last year's pension transfer transaction and mark-to-market accounting, EPS grew 4%, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher operating profit and a lower share count. All in all, solid results that position us well to meet our full year commitments.\nMoving to cash flow on Chart 6. We delivered our strongest quarter of cash class flow year-to-date with strong collections driving $2.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter while maintaining accelerated payments of $1.1 billion to suppliers. Shareholder cash deployment continues to exceed free cash flow year-to-date with 121% of free cash flow deployed through dividends and share repurchases. We have substantially completed our $4 billion -- our original $4 billion 2022 buyback target. As we announced this quarter, we also increased our dividend 7%, now paying an annualized dividend of $12 per share.\nMoving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher F-35 production volume, including the recognition of $325 million of sales that were deferred from the second quarter associated with the Lot 15 contract action. Increased volume in our classified programs at Skunk Works also contributed to the growth. Operating profit increased 6%, primarily following the sales volume increases on F-35, partially offset by lower margins on classified programs.\nMoving to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 2%, driven primarily by increased volume on PAC-3 interceptors. Segment operating profit was down 8% as lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter more than offset the benefit from higher volume.\nAt Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9, sales decreased year-over-year by 5%, driven primarily by lower Black Hawk production volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 10%, following Sikorsky production volume and lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter on the Black Hawk program.\nTurning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales were up 7%, driven primarily by the continued ramp of the next-generation interceptor program. Operating profit increased 14% following the volume increase, along with higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance.\nOkay. Moving to our updated outlook for 2022 on Page 11. We are maintaining our guidance from last quarter for sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. With the announcement this morning of a $14 billion repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors, we've increased our forecast for share buybacks to approximately $8 billion for the year, an increase of $4 billion from our prior expectation, reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth outlook and amplifying per share value creation.\nWe expect the EPS benefit from our incremental planned buybacks this year to be offset by the third quarter mark-to-market headwinds and therefore are holding our current EPS guide of $21.55 for the year. Also, while our consolidated outlook did not change, we did have some puts and takes between the business areas, and you can find that detail in our backlog charts.\nOn Chart 12, we've laid out our preliminary framework of expectations for 2023. As we've discussed before, we remain confident in sustained growth, driven by 4 pillars. Those are: programs of record, classified programs, hypersonics and new awards. This is supported by the higher backlog through the third quarter and further growth expected by year-end. We do anticipate flattish sales in 2023, however, primarily due to the delayed sales conversion in our programs of record backlog as the expected recovery from COVID and supply chain shortages will be more gradual than previously expected.\nIn our classified businesses, we expect another year of growth in 2023. This growth, along with our contract mix headwinds, will be accompanied by pressure of approximately 20 to 30 basis points in overall company segment operating margin, all compared to our 2022 outlook. We are confident that through cost reduction and business area synergy actions, we can work to limit this downward pressure. Importantly, through management focus and aggressive working capital actions, our expectations for 2023 free cash flow remain unchanged in spite of the top line and margin pressure.\nLooking forward, we are confident in the company's prospects for growth and value creation. With our aggressive share buyback plan, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 10% of our shares outstanding over the next several years. And coupled with a sustained free cash flow, we expect to deliver outstanding long-term value to shareholders.\nOkay. So let's wrap up on Chart 13. Our business area operational and financial performance in the third quarter was solid, and we are increasing our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We continue to invest in innovative solutions, including commercial technologies in support of our customers' important missions and 21st Century Security. Our focus remains on strong cash generation, and combined with our robust balance sheet and discipline and dynamic capital deployment strategy allow us to deliver long-term value to shareholders.\nBefore we open up to Q&A, I would also like to thank Greg Gardner for his 37 years of dedicated service and contributions to the company. He's been an outstanding partner and resource to all that he has supported. We wish him well in the next phase of his life. Greg will remain with us through the end of the year to transition Maria Ricciardone Lee. Maria brings Investor Relations experience from multiple companies, including UTX where we both worked together. She's an excellent financial executive and thought partner, and I'm excited that she is joining the team.\nWith that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGreg Gardner\n\nVP of IR, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStatements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.\nWe have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments.

Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I will begin today with an update on our F-35 program.\nYesterday, we signed a bilateral record of negotiation with the U.S. government, reaching agreement on the Lots 15 through 17 production contract. Through a collaborative effort with the F-35 enterprise, including the Joint Program Office, suppliers and teammates, we have concurred on the major parameters of the program, addressing inflationary and pandemic-related issues unanticipated at the start of the negotiation process.\nThe agreement supports our long-term objective to produce 156 aircraft a year. However, COVID impacts experienced by the F-35 enterprise have required us to modify our near-term production plan. Deliveries over the next 2 years are expected to remain in the 147 to 153 range of aircraft, similar to our 2022 plan before we then achieve our 156 aircraft delivery target in 2025. We continue to anticipate annual deliveries of 156 jets beyond 2025 for the foreseeable future.\nI'd like to thank the entire team for the dedication and professionalism shown throughout this process. And we look forward to delivering these unmatched fifth-generation aircraft for our U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines, our partner countries and our international customers.\nMoving to our quarterly results. Our business area operational performance was solid, delivering increased profit margins from last year's second quarter. Our new business activity and order flow were also favorable, and we continue to anticipate our backlog ending the year significantly above our 2021 levels, positioning us for longer-term growth.\nOur sales in the quarter were $15.4 billion, lower than we expected due to the delay in contract agreement on the F-35 and supply chain impacts. We anticipate the supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of the year. And we've reduced our 2022 outlook to reflect that as well as some other items, and Jay will cover this in more detail in a few minutes.\nWe also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, delivering over $1.1 billion to stockholders in dividends and repurchases, exceeding 100% of our free cash flow. We will continue to execute on our strategy of driving cash generation, disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and delivering attractive long-term total returns to you, shareholders.\nTurning briefly to budgets. Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved their versions of the FY '23 National Defense Authorization Act. The SASC recommended approximately a $45 billion increase to the President's request and the full House chamber passed the completed authorization bill with a $37 billion increase.\nWhile the budget process remains in its early stages, we are encouraged by the support our programs have seen with the Senate recommending additional F-35 and Black Hawk helicopters, increases over the lower-than-expected volumes that were in the initial President's request. Both the Senate markup and the House bill received strong bipartisan supporting committee with recognition of the need for greater investment to respond to increasing global security threats and the imperative of improving the readiness of our armed forces. Congress will continue the next phase of the authorization and appropriations process over the coming weeks and months. And we look forward to its timely finalization.\nTurning to our 21st Century Security strategy, I'd like to highlight an important example of how our signature platforms can be integrated into effective joint all-domain operations. These efforts are designed to benefit our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and guardians by continually upgrading their mission capabilities with the latest physical and digital world technologies.\nThis quarter, our Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control business areas partnered with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Valiant Shield 2022. This is a biannual training activity focused on integrating forces in multiple domains. Valiant Shield 2022 is a cornerstone of INDOPACOM's integrated deterrent strategy to prevent conflict in the region, and it's the largest U.S. joint force exercise in the Western Pacific.\nWe linked our DIAMONDShield battle management system, Aegis Weapon System, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or HIMARS and PAC-3 missiles to successfully demonstrate integrated multi-domain operations of strategic and tactical mission levels across air, land, sea and space. During this 12-day event, our Lockheed Martin team demonstrated all domain capabilities and collaboratively engaged in experiments with INDOPACOM using artificial intelligence to enable rapid decision-making in seconds or minutes compared to ours.\nTechnical demonstrations like these are key enablers to our 4-pillar growth strategy. And we will continue to demonstrate to our frontline commanders and servicemen and women in many additional exercise and real-world demonstrations to come.\nMoving to our 4-pillar growth areas and staying with the Pacific region, RMS' Aegis Weapon System was selected to be the backbone system for the Missile Defense Agency's Defense of Guam architecture. This is a pathfinder for joint all-domain operations for the DoD and for regional integrated air and missile defense with an expected program value itself of over $1 billion.\nThis architecture will defend against ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missile threats through the integration of capabilities across multiple industry products and not just Lockheed Martin. Aegis and our TPY-X radar, a derivative of our long-range discrimination radar product, will be the core systems to outpace the potential threat and expand JADO capabilities for Guam.\nThis Guam architecture leverages existing Lockheed Martin capabilities such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD, PAC-3, Sentinel A4 radar and our C2BMC command and control system, highlighting the advantages of our broad portfolio and cross-business area collaboration with Missiles and Fire Control. RMS will also fully integrate future system capabilities, which may include space-based sensors, directed energy and advanced missiles in the Defense of Guam, a critical cornerstone in Western Pacific deterrence. And we'll be using an open architecture where we can tie in other prime contractors, products and systems along with ours.\nStaying with RMS, this quarter, the U.S. Marine Corps approved our Sikorsky team CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, one of our key programs of record for initial operating capability. The IOC declaration validates the operational readiness of the King Stallion to forward deploy marines across the globe and positions the Marine Corps for a full rate production decision in 2023. The 53K has a plan of record to deliver 200 domestic aircraft and a total program life cycle value expected to be approximately $50 billion.\nWe're also excited this quarter to receive a $2.3 billion award for Sikorsky's 10th Black Hawk multiyear contract to provide 120 H-60 helicopters. This contract includes options, which, if exercised, have the potential to deliver an additional 135 rotorcraft with a value of up to another $4.4 billion.\nAlso this quarter, Missiles and Fire Control received a $1.6 billion contract award to produce THAAD interceptors for both domestic and international customers. Under this combined award, the THAAD team will provide both the U.S. government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with additional interceptors in support of integrated air and missile defense.\nOur MFC business area was also awarded a contract by the Missile Defense Agency to initiate production of the eighth THAAD battery. The eighth battery expands the U.S. government's ability to field the integrated air and missile defenses and builds upon the previously delivered 7 systems, a clear demonstration of the value delivered by the signature program and defending against current and emerging threats and maintaining deterrence.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to express my appreciation for the presidential visit to the Javelin manufacturing facility in Troy, Alabama, supporting the men and women who produce this remarkable product. The Ukraine conflict has been a dramatic reminder that we're in a global power competition. And we at Lockheed Martin stand ready to support our nation and its allies with advanced systems and technologies.\nThe U.S. alone has committed more than 5,500 Javelin missiles to Ukraine in defense of their country. And this visit spotlighted the continued need for a focus on global security and deterrence capabilities.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and provide an update to our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today.\nLet's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated second quarter financials. Operating results were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter along with nonoperating impacts that we previously had highlighted.\nWe generated sales of $15.4 billion. And as Jim noted, our revenues were affected by the delayed contract agreement for production Lots 15 through 17 on the F-35 program and supply chain impacts. Underlying performance was solid with segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and segment margin expansion of 60 basis points year-over-year to 11%.\nEarnings per share were $1.16, including $5.16 in nonoperational charges. And we delivered greater than $1 billion in free cash flow while returning 107% of that amount to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As noted in the press release, we updated our outlook, which I'll review later in my remarks.\nTurning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on Chart 4. Total sales declined 9% due to anticipated program transitions and supply chain impacts across the business areas in addition to more than $300 million in revenue shortfall from the gap in F-35 funding in advance of our agreement on Lots 15 through 17.\nOperating profit declined 4%. And as previously mentioned, segment operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 11%, reflecting another solid -- another quarter of solid underlying performance, benefits from contract mix as well as higher net step-ups largely due to the absence of last year's classified program charge in Aeronautics.\nMoving to earnings per share on Chart 5. We've included a reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to an adjusted or operational EPS. First, we've refinanced $2.3 billion of outstanding debt, including maturities for the next 3 years and lowering our near-term exposure to interest rate risk. This impact was $0.10.\nIn addition, we executed our latest pension transfer transaction. And as a reminder, this is our seventh such transaction to reduce long-term risk and volatility of pension trust asset returns. The impact to the quarter was $4.49, including $0.16 of tax timing that will reverse over the balance of the year.\nLastly, volatile capital markets have significantly impacted asset returns and our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund and other plans. Despite the short-term volatility, our ventures fund has delivered significant financial returns over the long term, but more importantly, has infused Lockheed Martin with emerging technologies to benefit our core business. Adjusted for these nonoperating items, our second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.32 and even higher had the F-35 funding constraint been lifted.\nMoving to cash flow on Chart 6. As you've come to expect, we delivered solid free cash flow in the quarter and accelerated payments of $1 billion to suppliers. Once again, cash deployed to shareholders exceeded free cash flow in the quarter. And for the first half of 2022, we have returned 178% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.\nOkay. Moving over to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Second quarter revenue decreased approximately $800 million from last year. F-35 sales were down over $900 million due to supply chain impacts, the impact of the Lot 15 through 17 unrecognized sales and sustainment award timing. This was partially offset by strength in our classified area, which increased by more than $200 million this quarter, a 50% increase from the second quarter of 2021. Segment operating margin for aero increased 180 basis points primarily due to the absence of last year's loss recorded on a large classified program.\nMoving to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales were lower by approximately $200 million, including the expected reduction in sustainment following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan as well as lower volume in multiple missile programs. Strong performance in tactical and strike missiles and in the missile defense PAC-3 program as well as favorable program mix drove a 160 basis points increase in segment operating margin.\nAt Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9, lower Black Hawk and presidential helicopter volume, along with supply chain impacts across the business area, lowered year-over-year sales by approximately $200 million. Operating profit was lower based on fewer favorable profit adjustments on Aegis and Radar programs, the impact from lower volume and changes in contract mix.\nTurning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Overall sales were down $350 million by a $425 -- or driven by a $425 million reduction from the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, which is partially offset by solid growth on a next-generation interceptor program. This will be the last quarter we'll be affected by the AWE compare. Operating profit was lower primarily due to the mix and timing of launches at United Launch Alliance as well as lower profit step-ups.\nOkay. Moving over to our updated outlook on Page 11. Our expectations for segment operating profit and free cash flow remain unchanged despite the lower sales outlook, reflecting solid year-to-date results and management's focus on operating performance.\nOur expectation for full year sales have been reduced by $750 million to approximately $65.25 billion. 3 of our 4 business areas have been reduced due to supply chain impacts, award timing and program schedule shifts, all of which are incorporated into our new guidance.\nThe impact of lower anticipated sales volume is expected to be offset by improved margins for the year, which is supported by our year-to-date margin performance. We are lowering the earnings per share outlook by $5.15 to reflect the impact of onetime items such as the pension transfer, debt refinancing and year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments.\nIt's important to note that these expectations assume that we definitize the Lot 15 through 17 contract here in the third quarter. In addition, there are no incremental mark-to-market impacts assumed for the second half of the year.\nOkay. Moving to Chart 12. We provided a detailed view of the changes to earnings per share for the year. The onetime pension settlement charge is now included in our outlook. And following the execution of that pension transfer, the remeasurement of our pension plans has caused us to reduce our FAS/CAS pension adjustment by $50 million. We've also incorporated the impacts of the year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments and our debt refinanced to the new estimate of approximately $21.55.\nOn Chart 13, you'll see the changes to guidance by business area. As I mentioned before, 3 of our 4 business areas have reduced sales outlooks, reflecting supply chain impact and award timing. But as noted, each business area is holding to the previous guidance for segment operating profit.\nWe're confident that we can deliver higher operating margins, offsetting the top line headwinds with our continued focus on cost reduction, program performance and leveraging the size and scale of the enterprise.\nOkay. Let's wrap up on Chart 14. Our operational performance in the second quarter was solid with improved segment margins and consistent cash generation and deployment. We revised our 2022 financial outlook, incorporating headwinds, but held our commitments for segment operating profit, free cash flow and cash deployment.\nNow looking beyond 2022, the Lockheed Martin fundamentals remain strong. We continue to invest in support of our customers' important security missions, leveraging the breadth of our platforms and solutions.\nOur broad portfolio as well as the current and projected backlog underpin our future growth expectations. In addition, the outlook for domestic and international defense spending has improved, and we expect to incorporate these changes over the coming months as we gain clarity on the timing of global security spending commitments and industry fulfillment.\nTo close, our pillars of growth, financial position, focus on strong cash generation and our disciplined and dynamic capital deployment strategy places us in an enviable position to deliver long-term value to shareholders.\nWith that, Brad, let's open up the call for Q&A.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGreg Gardner\n\nVP of IR, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStatements made in today's call that are not historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nPlease see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.\nWe have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'll begin today by welcoming Jay Malave to our executive management team.\nMany of you have worked with Jay during his 2-decade-plus career in the aerospace and defense industry and know him to be an exceptional financial professional and an outstanding leader. We're excited to have Jay join our company. On a personal level, I'm extremely pleased to be working with them.\nI'd also like to recognize John Mollard, he's with us today, for his tremendous contributions as our acting CFO. We're grateful to John for his leadership and financial acumen, and he's continued as a key member of our team, leading our treasury organization.\nMoving to our financials. Jay will discuss our first quarter results and 2022 outlook in detail in a few moments, but I'll begin with a brief overview. Our first quarter sales were slightly below our expectations. However, our full-year 2022 outlook remains intact.\nWe did experience some adverse impacts from the winter surge and the Omicron variant in our operations and our supply chain, but we expect these to reflect short-term timing issues. I'm proud of how our team responded to these challenges, and we remain committed to delivering all the objectives that we laid out in our January outlook.\nOur operational performance was solid, with our business areas delivering increased profit margins from last year's first quarter, and free cash flow was ahead of our projections. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, executing a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement during the quarter.\nWe are well on our way to achieving our full-year outlook of $4 billion in repurchases as we look to deliver over 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the course of the year, inclusive of dividends.\nWe will continue to execute on our long-term strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and thereby delivering strong long-term returns to shareholders.\nTurning to the F-35 program. Germany recently announced their intent to procure 35 aircraft. Lockheed Martin will support our U.S. government Joint Program Office in this process as we look to partner with Germany to provide this unique capacity and capability for its national defense.\nThe government of Canada has also announced it will enter into the finalization phase of their procurement process with the United States government and Lockheed Martin to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force.\nCanada is one of the original 8 partner countries on the F-35 program, and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to provide this unrivaled plane to strengthen Canada's national defense.\nThe German and Canadian announcements follow similar award decisions last year from Switzerland and Finland. And these 4 competitive wins have the potential to add 223 F-35s to our backlog when all are finalized.\nAll 4 of these recent announcements underscore that the F-35 fighter jet remains the most capable, survivable and highly-connected platform in production, as well as the best value available today for our warfighters.\nAnd although the initial quantity of F-35 is requested in the FY '23 President's budget submission, was below our expectations for [Lot-17] aircraft, we expect that the services adds via the unfunded priority list and increased international demand will enable us to deliver on the stabilized production profile we had previously established.\nWith respect to the overall Department of Defense budgets, this quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Act, with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\nAnd the bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation approved approximately $742 billion in DoD spending, an increase of nearly $40 billion over the FY '21 enacted amount.\nThe final bill resulted in increases that will benefit multiple Lockheed Martin programs over the next few years, including fully-funding 85 F-35s, 21 additional C-130J transport aircraft, 10 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K helicopters, as well as increases to some of our franchise satellite and missile programs.\nThis quarter, the President also submitted the fiscal year 2023 Defense Department budget request, the first step in the FY '23 budget process. The President submission added an additional $30 billion to the enacted FY '22 appropriations and totaled $773 billion in requested DoD funding.\nThis initial budget submission continues the administration's emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region, it supports Ukraine and focuses on strengthening our nation's deterrence capabilities, all initiatives that are well aligned with our portfolio and with our 21st Century security strategy.\nThe DoD also expanded investments in important technology development efforts such as Future Vertical Lift and hypersonics, also key elements in our multi-pillar growth strategy. And we look forward to providing our customers with innovative solutions for these and other important missions.\nOn a related note, I'd like to take a few moments to bring you up to date on 2 of the 4 pillars in our long-term growth strategy, our programs of record and new business opportunities.\nAs to programs of record, this quarter, our Sikorsky team received over $1 billion in orders for the CH-53K platform, one of the main contributors in our program of record growth pillar.\nThese announcements included awards for 13 low-rate initial production Lot 6 aircraft, including 4 for Israel, as well as long lead-time items for full-rate production Lot 7 helicopters. The program is performing very well. And as it continues to inflection to full production, we anticipate tripling our deliveries in the next few years.\nWe also continue to see significant opportunities across the competitive new business landscape. Beginning with our Space business area, we are very excited to be awarded transport layer tranche 1, one of three prototype agreements from the Space Development Agency.\nThe $700 million award to design and build 42 small low-earth orbit satellites as part of the initial tranche of the National Defense Space Architecture. This transport layer constellation will connect assets in space with platforms and other domains and a highly-capable mesh network environment for joint all-domain operations.\nAnd it's an outstanding example of 5G.MIL-enabled JADO technology, maturing into a program of record. This award built on our current tranche zero contract that will deliver 10 space vehicles later this year, and we look forward to continuing our support to the [FDA] and in the development of our country's next-generation space architecture.\nContinuing with competitive new business activity, in March, our Sikorsky team delivered our final updated prime proposal to the U.S. Army in response to their future long-range assault aircraft solicitation.\nSeveral weeks ago, we flew our defined aircraft 700 nautical miles from West Palm Beach to Nashville to be displayed at the Annual Army Aviation Association of America Conference. That was completing a 7-hour mission that further demonstrated the capabilities and the maturity of this remarkable rotorcraft.\nWe believe our Defiant offering is the most mission-capable platform available, one that will provide our soldiers with transformational capabilities and unparalleled maneuverability, and we're excited to offer this unique solution in support of our armed forces.\nBefore I hand the call over to Jay, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathy for those affected by the Russian government's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in devastating impact to the Ukrainian people and heightened security threats for the European continent.\nWhile we hope that this conflict is resolved peacefully soon, Lockheed Martin is taking steps to help address the resulting humanitarian crisis through multiple partners, including committing aid to the Polish Red Cross, Project HOPE, USO and others to provide assistance to refugees, and we will continue to support ongoing relief efforts in Eastern Europe.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.\n\nJay Malave\n\nCFO, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and it's an honor to be part of the Lockheed Martin team and represent our 114,000 employees on the first quarter earnings call.\nToday, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and discuss our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today.\nLet's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated first quarter results. As reported in our earnings release, results were largely in line with our expectations as the first quarter was impacted by program life cycle transitions.\nIn addition to the expected program effects, we also saw some impacts to sales timing, mostly due to the spike in COVID, early in Q1. Total segment operating profit was $1.7 billion, and segment operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%. Earnings per share were $6.44, and we delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow.\nWe also got off to a strong start to this year's capital allocation program, with $2 billion of shares repurchased in the quarter at an average price of approximately $427 per share. Along with almost $800 million in dividends paid, we returned greater than 2x our free cash flow to stockholders. And we remain committed to our full-year outlook.\nTurning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on Chart 4. Total sales declined by 8%, mostly reflecting anticipated program reductions, with about 1.5 points coming from supply chain and internal operations delays, primarily associated with the recent COVID surge.\nOur operations and supply chain teams did a strong job of managing this latest challenge, and we expect these timing impacts to be recovered over the course of 2022.\nSegment operating profit declined 5% versus last year, and our segment operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%, reflecting solid underlying performance in spite of lower net profit adjustments versus last year.\nTurning to segment sales on Chart 5. 3 of our 4 business areas were affected by expected program life cycle timing. Space declined by approximately $450 million due to the nationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program.\nRotary and Mission Systems sales were also lower, driven by approximately $300 million from the delivery of an Australian pilot training program in last year's first quarter, as well as other mission system program transitions and COVID-related timing impacts.\nAnd Missiles and Fire Control was lower due to supply chain delays in integrated air and missile defense, reduced sustainment revenue for special ops following the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and program transitions in the Tactical and Strike Missile business.\nAeronautics was flat this quarter as expected, with increased F-16 production offsetting lower volume on F-35. Moving to segment operating profit on Chart 6. Operating margins were higher at Space and MFC, with the increase in Space driven by additional ULA equity earnings.\nAnd MFC expansion from solid program performance and successful contract negotiations on an international program. Both Aero and RMS margins contracted primarily due to lower net profit adjustment, but they met or exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Overall, solid performance across the operations.\nTurning to earnings per share on Chart 7. Our first quarter EPS of $6.44 declined by 2% and reflected the impact of decreased sales volume, mark-to-market adjustments and lower FAS/CAS income, partially offset by benefits from the increased segment operating margin, reduced share count and a lower tax rate.\nShifting to first quarter cash generation and deployment on Chart 8. Free cash flow of $1.1 billion was ahead of our expectations, following the very strong $3.7 billion of free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nCash deployment continued to drive value for our stockholders as we returned $2 billion through share repurchases, leaving approximately $2 billion on our existing authorization and outlook for 2022.\nCombined with nearly $800 million in dividends paid, we returned over 240% of free cash flow to shareholders this quarter. Operational cash remains solid as the business looks to grow quarter-over-quarter through the rest of 2022.\nOkay. Moving over to our 2022 outlook on Chart 9. We remain confident in our full-year outlook as we have seen improvements since the Omicron variant spike. Our first quarter sales were approximately $250 million below our expectations, which equates to less than a single day of volume, and we expect this to be fully recouped throughout 2022.\nFor the balance of the year, we project sales of slightly below $16 billion in the second quarter, around $17 billion in the third quarter and $18 billion in the fourth quarter. As our release stated, our outlook does not include any impacts from potential debt refinance or pension liability transfer actions that are currently under evaluation.\nOn Chart 10, we break out our segment sales and operating profit outlook. Our segment estimates for 2022 remain consistent with the guidance we provided in January, and we continue to anticipate long-term growth for all 4 of our business areas.\nIt's important to note that our consolidated and Aero outlooks are dependent upon reaching agreement on F-35 Lots 15 through 17 here in the second quarter as funding constraints would likely cause a timing impact to our financial results, beginning this quarter.\nOur teams are diligently working with their Joint Program Office counterparts to achieve closure on this critical milestone. And both parties are striving to finish negotiations in the near term. So we remain confident in our full-year projections.\nOkay, to bring it all together on Chart 11. The first quarter delivered solid operational performance that was largely in line with our expectations, in spite of the effects of the recent COVID spikes.\nOur cash generation and deployment also got off to a good start, with a focus on strategic investment for growth and fulfilling our capital allocation outlook for the year. Our solid performance and our 4-pillar growth strategy have us well positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value.\nSo with that, John, let's open up to questions.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President, Investor Relations.

Taiclet\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and I hope you've had a good start to the new year. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2022.\nI'll begin with an update regarding our proposed acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we thought it highly likely that the FTC would sue to block the transaction. Since that time, we have received notification from the FTC that they have, in fact, authorized filing a lawsuit. We will review the lawsuit and evaluate all of our options. With the filing of the suit, we may elect to defend the lawsuit or terminate the merger agreement.\nMoving on to our financial results. In a few minutes, John will discuss our financials in detail and provide our outlook for 2022. But I first would like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and the year. In October, after we concluded our financial planning process, we established an updated forecast for 2021, which we achieved or exceeded. We met our $67 billion sales forecast, and our segment operating profit and earnings per share both exceeded our projections. Our cash from operations was exceptionally strong, over $9.2 billion, supporting our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process.\nDuring the year, we made significant investments in our signature platforms and systems as well as emerging technologies, all to meet the rapidly evolving challenges, as we see every day in the news now, the challenges that our customers are facing and to support future growth for the benefit of our shareholders. Moreover, we continue reshaping and modernizing our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs so we can deliver affordable solutions for our customers going forward as well.\nDuring 2021, we spent $1.5 billion on independent research and development, a new high watermark for the company. Notable areas of our IR&D efforts included hypersonics, directed energy and artificial intelligence. We also initiated the development of mission-based technology road maps and advanced our 5G.MIL architecture to truly enable joint all-domain operations across multiple platforms, U.S. military services and allies. These investments position the company to meet our customers' most critical needs well into the future.\nDuring the year, we also spent $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, focused on addressing customers' program requirements and supporting our organic growth outlook. Significant capital projects included the introduction of 3 new state-of-the-art factories of the future, additional adoption of cutting-edge software and hardware solutions to enable model-based engineering throughout the company, and the establishment of production facilities to support our key hypersonics program.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we brought many of these elements together for the opening of an intelligent advanced hypersonic strike production facility in Cortland, Alabama, supporting both our Missiles and Fire Control and Space hypersonic programs. This facility integrates critical digital transformation advancements such as robotic thermal protection capabilities into our manufacturing operations and represents our long-term investment in this critical technology.\nThe Cortland facility joins our new spacecraft Test Assembly and Resource Center in Greenville, Florida and our recently opened 215,000 square foot advanced manufacturing facility in our Skunk Works organization in Palmdale, California. Together, these facilities add to our intelligent factory framework, digitally linking sites and assets across the enterprise to speed production, provide cost efficiencies and drive future margin improvements throughout the company.\nFrom a capital return perspective, during the quarter, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program and thereby retired nearly 6 million shares under that agreement. This brought our total 2021 repurchase amount to over $4 billion, which when coupled with our strong dividend payments resulted in a total of $7 billion of cash returned to our shareholders during the year. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases and expect to utilize our remaining $4 billion authorization in 2022.\nI'll now touch briefly on the Department of Defense budgets. This quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. The NDAA policy bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation authorizes a $25 billion increase for the Department of Defense for a total of approximately $740 billion for defense programs and raised the investment accounts approximately 8% above the President's originally requested amounts.\nCurrently, the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through February 18 for FY 2022. As Congress continues the appropriations process, we believe our programs are well supported, reflecting the fact that our portfolio is aligned with affordably delivering our customers' national security capabilities.\nNow turning now to our growth strategy. Last quarter, we discussed our long-term expectations, which anticipate that our sales will increase by approximately 2% in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. As we discussed in October, the 4 primary areas that underpin this longer-term growth forecast are programs of record, classified activities, hypersonics and new business awards.\nExpansion in our program of records is a clear key pillar of our long-term growth strategy. In this quarter, we are pleased to see 2 new customers select our signature programs to support their national security objectives.\nLast month, the government of Finland selected the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as the winning entry in their HX Fighter Program competition, citing the aircraft's affordability as well as its combat reconnaissance and survival capabilities is best suited to deliver on the HX requirements. This announcement for 64 conventional takeoff and landing stealth fighters has a potential contract value of over $9 billion and follows Switzerland's decision to purchase 36 F-35s. These announcements highlight the momentum that is building in this program with future international opportunities in Canada and elsewhere to go in front of us.\nOur Rotary and Mission Systems team also secured an important international opportunity this past quarter as the Israeli Air Force signed a letter of acceptance with the United States government to pursue the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter. This agreement enables the Israeli Air Force to procure 12 53Ks with the option to buy another half dozen. If fully exercised, those options could exceed $2 billion in value. Israel then be our first international CH-53K customer as they look to replace their current fleet of legacy Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, which have been flying over 50 years.\nAnother pillar of our long-term growth strategy, our classified activities, also saw momentum build in the fourth quarter. Our Space business area was awarded a contract by the U.S. Air Force to develop and classify -- fly a prototype RF payloads in space. Our solution leverages ongoing internal investments on our LM-400 satellite bus, providing greater mission flexibility and longer-duration orbit life. This award for initial engineering contract includes options to deliver an operational system with the potential for this to grow into a new franchise program down the road.\nAnd on a final note, 2021 presented a challenging environment for both commercial and defense industries, especially in terms of continuing COVID-19 effects and supply chain impacts. Our teams in all 4 Lockheed Martin business areas and across our corporate functions banded together and did a tremendous job maintaining our production operations and advancing science and engineering on behalf of our customers.\nI'm extremely proud of the perseverance and dedication of our entire organization, and I know that as One Lockheed Martin, we're going to drive future growth into our business and advance our vision to accelerate 21st Century Digital World Technologies into our national defense enterprise.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to John and join you later to answer your questions.\n\nJohn W. Mollard\n\nActing CFO, VP & Treasurer, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nAll right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we've included with our earnings release today.\nLet's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of 2021 results. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $67 billion, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in October. This record level of sales was made possible by an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of delivering affordable, relevant solutions to our customers. Additionally, our segment operating profit of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of $22.76 exceeded our October projections driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio.\nWe generated more than $9.2 billion in operating cash flow this year. And as we discussed last quarter, we are committed to a strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital allocation. We continue reshaping our operations and identifying ways we can increase efficiencies and reduce costs.\nAs Jim mentioned, we invested $3 billion in research and development and capital expenditures to help our customers achieve their missions and to drive organic growth. In addition to this internal reinvestment, we repurchased over $4 billion of shares in 2021, including $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with increased annual dividend payments of approximately $3 billion, we returned just over $7 billion to shareholders.\nLooking forward, our outlook for 2022 remains consistent with our October trending information as we build our foundation for growth in 2023 and beyond.\nTurning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales and segment operating profit both increased 3% compared to 2020 results and represent high watermarks for the company.\nChart 5 shows our earnings per share for the year. Our full year earnings per share of $22.76 incorporates the $4.72 noncash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer that we completed during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, our pre-transaction EPS of $27.48 was 12% higher than our 2020 results due to increased volume and improved segment operating margin, gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio, increased FAS/CAS pension income, and a reduction in share count.\nOn Chart 6, we look at our full year cash generation and deployment. 2021 cash performance was outstanding as we generated over $9.2 billion in operating cash flow and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. We returned 91% of this free cash flow to our shareholders through increased share repurchases and dividends. Our remaining share repurchase authority is approximately $4 billion, and we expect to opportunistically deploy that entire amount in 2022.\nMoving on to Chart 7 and our 2022 guidance. Consistent with our October trading information, we estimate 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion and segment operating profit of approximately $7.2 billion, resulting in a segment operating margin of 10.9%. FAS/CAS pension income is projected at $2.26 billion, which is $60 million higher than the $2.2 billion estimate we provided in October.\nWe are projecting earnings per share of $26.70, and our estimate for 2022 cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8.4 billion excluding the impacts of the R&D capitalization tax law change, which we now estimate at approximately $500 million. I should mention there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers or refuels the requirement to capitalize R&D expenditures from a tax payment perspective, but we are including the impact of higher tax payments in our current outlook as we will be required to make these payments unless existing law is amended by legislation.\nOn Chart 8, we show our updated 3-year forecast for cash generation. Our outstanding fourth quarter cash flow was driven by a tightly coordinated collections process across all business areas and functional support organizations, leading to exceptional collection results from both domestic and international customers. Partially offsetting this upside was an increase of $700 million in accelerated payments we made to our supply chain during the fourth quarter.\nWith the emergence of the Omicron variant and surges in COVID cases, we increased total accelerated payments to over $2.2 billion at year-end and our continuing effort to mitigate supply chain risk. Our outstanding collection performance and the increase in accelerated payments to our supply chain partners resulted in our generating $9.2 billion in cash from operations and $7.7 billion in free cash flow.\nOver the 3-year period from 2021 through 2023 and before considering the potential impacts of R&D capitalization, we now project total cash from operations of greater than or equal to $26.1 billion, which is $900 million higher than our prior estimate. This increase was driven by our fourth quarter results and our expectation that we will maintain this extremely high level of performance throughout the forecast period. Generating over $25 billion in operating cash flow after incorporating the potential $900 million impact of R&D capitalization provides significant support for our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy.\nOn Chart 9, we break out our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business areas. Our estimates for the year remain consistent with the trending information we provided in October as we focus on long-term growth opportunities and building on the strong operational results we delivered in the fourth quarter.\nAnd on Chart 10 to summarize, we successfully closed out 2021 with all metrics equal to or better than the guidance we provided in October, highlighted by exceptional cash generation. With our strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate high levels of operating cash flow, we are well positioned to execute on our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy for years to come. I'm excited about our opportunities in 2022 as we deliver mission capabilities for our customers and long-term value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.",

Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, Chief Accounting Officer & Head of IR\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'm here today with Laura Laura Alber, our Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sameer Hassan, our Chief Technology and Digital Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including our updated guidance for fiscal '25 and our long-term outlook.\nWe believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'm excited to talk to you about our third quarter. First, I'd like to take a moment to thank our team for their continued hard work. Everyone at Williams-Sonoma Inc. has been focused on our key 3 priorities this year, which are returning to growth, elevating customer service and driving earnings. And that focus continues to drive our results. .\nWe are proud to deliver strong results in the third quarter of 2025 with an accelerating positive top line comp and continued outperformance in our profitability. In Q3, our comp came in above expectations at 4%, driven by another quarter of positive comps across all of our brands, and we continue to deliver on the bottom line despite the substantial tariff headwinds.\nOur operating margin came in at 17%, expanding 10 basis points with earnings per share of $1.96, growing 5% year-over-year. We are encouraged by our continued strong year-to-date performance through Q3 and are confident in our outlook for Q4. And therefore, we are reiterating our outlook for the full year comparable brand revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 5%, and we are raising our bottom line guidance 40 basis points to an operating margin of 17.8% to 18.1% versus 17.4% to 17.8%. We drove this improvement in performance despite continued geopolitical uncertainty and no substantive improvement in the housing market.\nAnd we continue to gain market share and outperform the industry, which declined again in Q3. Our continued strong results reflect the power of our operating model, industry-leading channel experiences and strong portfolio of brands. We continue to see exceptional performance in our retail channel, which ran a positive 8.5 comp in Q3. Retail continues to benefit from an improved in-store experience with more inventory availability, enhanced design services and events and the opening of 14 beautiful newly remodeled or repositioned stores so far this year with 7 more to come in Q4.\nThis investment is paying off with almost all of them beating the performance of the prior location. Our stores service brand billboards, and we believe a refreshed store improves customer perception of our brands. As we move into the final quarter of 2025, I want to highlight the specific progress we've made on our 3 key priorities. Starting with growth, our core brands continue to deliver strong results from positive momentum in furniture.\nOur focus on innovation has driven strong and improving furniture comps. Additionally, we are focused on incremental growth categories like Pottery Barn Dorm and West Elm Kids. We're also broadening our reach through strategic collaborations. These initiatives attract new customers while keeping our brands fresh and relevant. Our B2B business also remains an important growth engine, up 9% this quarter with strength in both trade and contracts, and our emerging brands, Rejuvenation, Mark, Graham and GreenRow continue to perform exceptionally well.\nTogether, they delivered a double-digit comp, and we're excited to have recently opened our 13th Rejuvenation store in Salt Lake City. This year, we're also very proud of our improvements in customer service. We are committed to flawless execution delivering orders on time, damage-free every time, and we're proud that this year, we have record metrics. We're focusing on furthering our improvements through fewer split shipments and faster fulfillment.\nFinally, our third key priority, driving earnings. Our focus on revenue growth, elevating customer service and maintaining cost discipline has delivered strong earnings with our year-to-date earnings per share growing 5% in a very tough tariff environment. Also in Q3, we used AI as a key business driver to accelerate our strategy. Across our portfolio, AI-powered chat experiences are now live for all brands, providing customer service, delivery support and product guidance. These agents are improving speed, consistency and satisfaction, and we are now resolving over 60% of chats without human assistance, reducing handle times from 23 minutes to just 5 minutes.\nAnother notable milestone this quarter was the launch of Olive, our new AI culinary and shopping companion for the Williams-Sonoma brand. Olive helps customers plan, cook and shop with confidence combining our culinary authority with cutting-edge technology to create a differentiated experience. What makes Williams-Sonoma unique is how AI can amplify our differentiated foundation with our proprietary data, our vertical integration from design to delivery, our multichannel engagement and our expertise in home design in the culinary space.\nOur strong balance sheet, coupled with our tech capabilities allows us to apply AI in ways that can drive real scalable impact for our business that others cannot. Looking ahead, we see opportunity to drive down costs and drive up sales with AI, and our early results are reinforcing that confidence. We're using AI to enhance what we do best, guiding customers through shopping and design decisions. Additionally, AI is driving improvements in productivity and empowering associates with tools to amplify their creativity and expertise.\nNow I'd like to update you on tariffs. Since we last spoke, there have been notable changes in tariffs, such as a new tariff on some furniture, including imported upholstery kitchen cabinets and bath vanities. And now the 20% additional China tariff are down from 30%. Net-net, these changes are a push to our current estimated impact. As we look forward to the future, predictability in the tariff environment and a reduction in the [ India ] tariff would certainly be a positive for us.\nIn the meantime, we continue to be actively and aggressively mitigating what we can with our previously discussed 6-point plan. To remind you, first, we are obtaining cost concessions from our vendors. Second, we are resourcing goods to get the best cost for our customers. Third, we're identifying further supply chain efficiency. Fourth, we are controlling costs. Fifth, we are expanding our Made in USA assortment, production and partnerships. And last, we are taking select price increases with a focus on maintaining competitive pricing.\nNow let's review our brands. Pottery Barn ran a positive 1.3% comp in Q3. We are pleased with the improvement we saw in large ticket, including furniture, upholstery and lighting. Our Pottery Barn stores continue to outperform, led by our standout design crew services and our increased take at-home today assortment. Our strategy of focusing on improving retail inventory availability, refreshing product assortments and enhancing design services is working. We have opened 6 beautiful new remodels or repositioned Pottery Barn stores so far this year with 3 more to come in Q4.\nFinally, across the brand, we continue a major change that we have made all year, which is to substantially reduce promotions in Pottery Barn. Now I'd like to talk to you about our Pottery Barn Children's business, which ran a 4.4% comp in Q3. We saw acceleration in furniture fueled by successful new product launches, continued growth in collaborations and back-to-school and Dorm was a particular highlight in the quarter. In fact, back-to-school delivered double-digit growth, an acceleration from Q2. Our brands have become a destination for high-quality study solutions, durable backpack and on-trend dorm decor.\nAdditionally, our enhanced dorm design tools and pickup near campus options have been important for gaining share in a very fragmented market. Now let's review West Elm. West Elm ran a positive 3.3% comp in Q3. We continue to make progress against the brand's 4 key pillars: product, brand heat, channel excellence and operational efficiency. Throughout the year, West Elm has brought in new successful collections in both furniture -- and on Furniture, where the brand was previously underdeveloped. West Elm has significantly shifted the composition of their sales towards new products and the cumulative effect of new introductions since the fall of last year continues to produce results.\nRetail and West Elm was also a highlight due to improved in-stocks and more new furniture and more new fabrics displayed on the retail floor. And we've opened 2 beautiful new remodels or repositioned West Elm stores so far this year, with 1 more to come in Q4. To remind everyone, we have 119 stores in West Elm. And based on results, we are looking forward to returning to retail unit growth in this brand. As you can hear, we are quite excited by the momentum at West Elm.\nNow let's review the Williams-Sonoma brand, which continues to fire on all fronts and we had a positive 7.3% comp in Q3. Williams-Sonoma remains focused on premium quality products that are expertly crafted combining style and functionality. In Q3, we celebrated many successful culinary stories from the food and flavors of Spain to authentic Indian flavors through a collaboration with Palak Patel, Founder of The Chutney Life. We also recently launched a Wicked collection featuring limited-edition, Le Creuset Dutch ovens inspired by Elphaba and Glinda.\nAnd as we continue to connect our customers to the world's best chefs and products, we are seeing great traction with in-store events. Across the country, we hosted 42 in-store book signing events in Q3. We welcome the fans of celebrities and celebrity chefs like Neil Patrick Harris, David Burke and Melissa King into our stores for amazing cooking demos and cookbook signing.\nFinally, we've opened 6 beautiful remodeled or repositioned Williams-Sonoma stores so far this year with 2 more to come in Q4. Now I'd like to update you on B2B, which grew 9% in Q3 with both trade and contract delivering strong comps. Leveraging our design expertise and commercial-grade product assortment, we've built a strong and growing client base across multiple industries. Our B2B offering remains a powerful differentiator, and we are seeing continued momentum. Our biggest success story in Q3 was an increase in commercial workspace wins, including projects with Google, WeWork, TurboTax and PayPal.\nQ4 brings the ramp-up of our growing corporate gifting program, including our leading assortment of quality giftables that can be customized with logos and company branding. We're also a destination for seasonal favorites that make a perfect client and employee holiday gift, If Any of You Need Help.\nNow I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. With our proven ability to incubate and scale brands in-house, we are confident in the continued growth of our concepts and their ability to deliver profitability to our results. Rejuvenation delivered strong double-digit comps in the quarter, continuing an upward trajectory fueled by product innovation and category expansion. Our high-quality product offer and proprietary designs are resonating with customers.\nBoth channels are performing well, and we continue to open new retail locations to drive brand awareness. This quarter, we expanded our Rejuvenation store count to 13, with the opening of 2 new storefronts 1 in Nashville and 1 in Salt Lake City. The brand also saw a strong performance from its first ever lighting collaboration. Mark and Graham delivered its best Q3 in brand history, driven by successful new categories, [ MMG Kids ] and Bark & Graham as well as continued growth in personalized corporate gifting.\nAs we head into the peak gifting season, the brand is well positioned with thoughtful, personalized gifts for all occasions. I'm also excited to talk about our newest brand, GreenRow, which delivered strong growth this quarter. In Q3, we launched the largest holiday collection to date with handcrafted decor and gifts made from up cycles and natural materials. The brand's colorful and unique products have had a great response and the product line is incredibly beautiful in person.\nTherefore, we believe retail stores are the next leg of growth at GreenRow and are looking to test a few store locations as soon as possible. Finally, I'd like to share one highlight in our global business. In the U.K., we broadened our brand presence with the launch of Pottery Barn Online and the opening of a pop-up store in our West Elm Tottenham Court Road in London. And so far, we're quite pleased with the performance of Pottery Barn in this new market.\nIn summary, we're pleased with our execution and continued outperformance in Q3 marked by accelerating positive comps and strong profitability. Across the company, we remain dedicated to enhancing our channel experiences and strengthening our brands. Each and every day, we prioritize innovation, product design and exceptional customer service. These are the qualities that set us apart in a fragmented industry and position us to capture additional market share.\nWe see tremendous opportunity to continue to lead our industry as we execute on our vision to own the home and the places where our customers work, stay and play. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we're filled with optimism for a strong finish. This holiday season, we're ready to showcase our best across our stores and online. From all of us, we wish you and your family on joyful Thanksgiving next week and a happy holiday season.\nBefore I hand things over to Jeff, I want to take another minute to express our thanks to our team, our vendors and all of our partners for their ongoing dedication and contributions to our company's success. We appreciate everything they do. And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter reflect Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s competitive advantages in the home furnishings industry, including the following: the strength of our multi-brand portfolio across different categories, aesthetics and price points. Our size and scale, providing the ability to drive market share gains as we maximize white space opportunities. The competitive advantage of our multichannel platform, serving customers where they choose to shop online, in-store or business to business.\nOur focus on customer service and full price selling, creating efficiency and cost savings across our supply chain. And finally, the power of our operating model to deliver highly profitable earnings. Our headlines for this quarter demonstrate these competitive advantages. We delivered positive comps for the fourth straight quarter. Furniture and nonfurniture categories both ran positive comps, reflecting strength across all categories of our offering.\nWhite space opportunities, such as Dorm, West Elm Kids and Rejuvenation grew double digits. Retail, e-commerce and business-to-business all drove positive comps. Our supply chain team achieved best-ever results across nearly all customer service metrics while simultaneously improving efficiency and reducing costs. And despite the headwinds from tariffs, we drove operating margin expansion of 10 basis points to 17% and EPS growth of 5% to $1.96 per share.\nOur results this quarter would not be possible without the team we have at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. I'd like to thank our talented, dedicated team for delivering these outstanding results. Now let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q3 results and then update guidance for fiscal year '25. Q3 net revenue finished at $1.88 billion for a positive 4% comp. All brands delivered positive comps driven by positive comps in both our furniture and nonfurniture categories.\nWe gained market share in the quarter, even as we increased our penetration of full price selling. From a channel perspective, both channels delivered positive comps, with retail up 8.5% comp and e-commerce, up 1.9% comp. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin exceeded our expectations, coming in at 46.1%, 70 basis points higher than last year. Higher merchandise margins and supply chain efficiencies drove this gross margin improvement, offset by slightly higher occupancy costs.\nMerchandise margins delivered 60 basis points of our gross margin improvement, exceeding our expectations. The factors contributed to this improvement in merchandise margins. First, the impact from tariffs is taking longer than anticipated to flow through to our gross margin. This is due to the delayed effective dates of the tariffs and our aggressive front-loading of inventory before tariff effective dates. Second, we are seeing margin upside from our 6-point tariff mitigation plan, including price increases, as well as strong consumer response to our full-price product offering.\nAnd finally, lower inbound transportation costs are helping offset tariff costs. Supply chain efficiencies added 30 basis points to our gross margin. Our focus on customer service and in-stock ready to sell inventory is delivering tangible margin improvements from lower accommodations, damages, replacements and out-of-market shipping expense.\nOccupancy costs were up 5.9% and were 20 basis points higher year-over-year. This was because of our retail outperformance and the higher occupancy costs in that channel. To recap, our gross margin results this quarter exceeded our expectations. Our tariff mitigation efforts more than offset the headwinds from tariffs in the third quarter.\nTurning now to SG&A. Our Q3 SG&A ran at 29.1% of revenues, 60 basis points higher than last year. Employment expense deleveraged 50 basis points due to higher incentive compensation from our strong results year-to-date. We continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers in line with top line trends.\nAdvertising expenses were 20 basis points higher year-over-year. Our in-house marketing team continues to test and optimize into different levels of spend. During the quarter, we increased our investment in digital advertising. After testing and proprietary in-house analytics model indicated we could scale efficiently. The higher spend drove an acceleration in year-over-year site traffic and improved revenue per visit.\nOur in-house marketing team's ability to test, scale and optimize across our portfolio of brands is a competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry. Finally, general expenses leveraged 10 basis points. On the bottom line, our earnings exceeded our expectations. Despite the tariff headwinds, our operating margin of 17% was 10 basis points above last year and diluted earnings per share grew 5% year-over-year to $1.96.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $885 million with no outstanding debt. We generated $316 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and invested $68 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth. During the quarter, we returned $347 million to our shareholders. We did this through $267 million in stock repurchases and $80 million in dividends.\nMerchandise inventories stood at $1.5 billion, up 9.6% from last year. Our inventory includes $48 million of incremental tariff costs recorded in inventory as well as $30 million of a strategic pull forward of receipts and lower tariff rates than in effect today. Without this incremental $78 million, our inventory level would be in line with our sales trends. Overall, our inventory levels and composition are well positioned to support our upcoming holiday season.\nSumming up our Q3. We're proud to have delivered strong results, even as we navigated a challenging tariff environment and historically low housing turnover.\nNow let's turn to our guidance for fiscal year '25. First, some housekeeping. In the first quarter of fiscal year '24, we recorded a $49 million out-of-period adjustment related to prior year's freight accrual. This benefited fiscal year '24 operating margin results by approximately 70 basis points. Our guidance for fiscal year '25 uses our fiscal year '24 results without the out-of-period adjustment as a comparable basis.\nAdditionally, fiscal year '24 was a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. In fiscal year '25, we will report comps on a 52-week versus 52-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 52 weeks versus 53 weeks. On full year '24 results, the additional week contributed 150 basis points to revenue growth and 20 basis points to operating margin. The discrete impact of the additional week on just Q4 '24 was 510 basis points to revenue growth and 60 basis points to operating margin.\nNow our guidance. Given our strong Q3 results and our outlook for Q4, we are updating our fiscal year '25 guidance. On the top line, we are reiterating our fiscal year '25 net revenue guidance. We expect full year '25 comps to be in the range of positive 2% to positive 5%, with total net revenues in the range of positive 0.5% to positive 3.5% due to the 53rd week impact from last year.\nOur guidance continues to assume no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment, or interest rates or housing turnover. Our guide reflects the continued strength in our business, strong customer response to our product lineup and continued traction across our growth initiatives. On the bottom line, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance 40 basis points to a range of 17.8% to 18.1%. This means that despite the tariff headwinds, we are now guiding the midpoint of our fiscal year '25 operating margin to be approximately 20 basis points above last year when excluding the 53rd week impact.\nOur higher operating margin guide reflects both the strong results we have delivered year-to-date and the expectation that tariffs will have a greater impact on our margins in Q4. Our updated guidance reflects all the tariffs in place as of this call. This includes the new Section 232 tariffs on furniture, the revised 20% additional China tariffs, the 50% India tariff, the 20% Vietnam tariff and an average 18% tariff on the rest of the world as well as the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs, and a 50% copper tariff.\nIn fact, our incremental tariff rate has more than doubled from 14% earlier this year to 29% today, inclusive of all the tariffs I just mentioned. We believe the strength of our operating model, combined with the 6-point mitigation plan Laura outlined enables us to mitigate a large portion of these tariffs, which is embedded in our guidance. It's important to note the tariff policy has been volatile and subject to multiple revisions.\nIt's hard to say where tariffs will ultimately land and what impact they will have on our business. Our guidance reflects our best estimates of the impact based upon the tariffs in place as of this call. Also today, we are providing some further inputs for modeling purposes. We now expect our full year interest income to be approximately $35 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 26%.\nTurning now to capital allocation. Our plans for fiscal year '25 continue to prioritize funding our business operations and investing in long-term growth. We expect to spend between $250 million and $275 million on capital expenditures in fiscal year '25. We are investing 85% of this capital spend on our e-commerce channel, retail optimization and supply chain efficiency. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases.\nFor dividends, we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.66 per share, which is a 16% increase year-over-year. We are proud today that fiscal year '25 is the 16th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts. For share repurchases, we announced today that our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to approximately $1.6 billion.\nWe remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing our stock to provide returns to our shareholders. As we look forward to 2026, we will balance our long-term growth potential with the tariff and macroeconomic landscape, and we will provide guidance in March. As we look further into the future beyond '26, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins in the mid- to high teens.\nWrapping up Laura's and my comments, we delivered another quarter of strong results despite the headwinds from tariff policy and historically low housing turnover. Our focus remains on our 3 key priorities: returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We are confident we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 reasons.\nOur ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resilience of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions."

Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, Chief Accounting Officer & Head of IR\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. I'm here today with Laura Alber, our Chief Executive Officer; Jeff HowIe, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sameer Hassan, our Chief Technology and Digital Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including our updated guidance, for fiscal '25 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations.

Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'm excited to talk to you about our second quarter. Before we get into our results, I'd like to acknowledge our team for their hard work. Their commitment, creativity and focus continues to drive our success. We're proud to deliver strong results in the second quarter of 2025 with another positive top line comp and continued outperformance in our profitability.\nIn Q2, our comp came in above expectations at 3.7%, with all brands, again, running positive comps. And we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 17.9% and earnings per share of $2, with earnings growth of nearly 20%. This was our second quarter of accelerated positive comps coming out of 2024 despite continued geopolitical uncertainty and no material improvement in the housing market. And we continue to outperform the industry, which declined in Q2. This growing outperformance was driven by positive comps in both furniture and nonfurniture and strong performance in our retail and e-commerce channels.\nAs we move into the second half of 2025, we are continuing to focus on 3 key priorities: first, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and third, driving earnings. Let's take a moment to review how we're advancing these priorities. First, in our core brands, we have increased our newness offer and our focus on categories where there is substantial white space in the market. Our product development competency is a distinct competitive advantage and allows us to deliver exclusive high-quality merchandise at a compelling value.\nAnd our focus on innovation is driving results, particularly in furniture, where newness pushed us into positive furniture comps. Our growth strategy also includes diversifying our assortment in seasonal decor, textiles and housewares. And strategic collaborations are another critical part of our growth plan. These collaborations continue to expand new customer growth and drive sales and most importantly, drive relevance and excitement for our brands and our customers. Also, our B2B business remains an important part of our growth strategy. grew 10% in Q2 with both trade and contract performing. We continue to build a loyal expanding client base across multiple industries by leveraging our design expertise and commercial-grade product range. Our emerging brands, including Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham and GreenRow, together also continue to grow double digits.\nWe have a proven ability to build and scale brands. and we are particularly excited about Rejuvenation, which drove its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comps in Q2. We currently have 11 Rejuvenation stores and we'll be opening up our 12th store in Nashville in September. We continue to believe that Rejuvination will be our next $1 billion brand. Beyond growth, our next priority is to focus on customer service. We are committed to providing flawless customer service with orders that are delivered on time and damage-free every time. Our operational performance continues to be better than our benchmarks. And we are focused on further optimizing these metrics by minimizing returns and damages, reducing split shipments and decreasing fulfillment time. With even further opportunity for supply chain efficiencies in the long term as we implement AI capabilities.\nAnd finally, the cumulative results of our focus on returning to growth, improving customer service, and tightly controlling expenses will enable us to drive our third key priority, strong earnings. Now I'd like to share an update on the opportunity we see with AI at Williams-Sonoma. We don't view AI as a standalone function. It is embedded across our business. Our strategy is organized into 3 areas: enhancing the customer experience, optimizing our supply chain and automating internal operations. On the customer experience, we are already seeing strong results from our new ad powered customer service assistant, which we launched with Pottery Barn Kids earlier this summer and are scaling across all of our brands this week. It is improving issue resolution rates and speed while reducing cost, creating a better experience for both customers and associates.\nWe are also advancing our next generation of digital design tools and preparing to launch a culinary companion that will help customers with everything from cookware discovery to holiday entertaining. In the supply chain, our vertically integrated model gives us unmatched control from design to sourcing to final mile delivery. This enables us to apply AI end-to-end, improving forecasting, optimizing inventory and increasing delivery accuracy. Few in our industry have the breadth of ownership to unlock this level of efficiency. And finally, we are driving meaningful efficiency gains in our internal operations. Through our proprietary AI platform built to rapidly create secure business-specific applications and through partnerships with best-of-class providers, we are automating workflows across functions such as finance, HR and technology.\nEarly adoption has already yielded measurable improvements in productivity, software development velocity and creative production. The foundation across all of this is our proprietary data, combined with decades of expertise in design, culinary and omnichannel retail. We are already seeing very real impact in financial results from these investments from higher conversion and sales growth to measurable cost savings and productivity gains. AI is not just a future opportunity for us. It is delivering results today, and we believe it positions Williams-Sonoma to lead our industry in applying AI with both creativity and discipline. Turning to guidance. We are encouraged by our strong sales trends so far in 2025, and therefore, we are raising our top line guidance. We now expect full year comparable brand revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 5%.\nIn terms of how that incremental revenue flows through to our operating margin, we expect that this additional top line growth will be pressured by incremental tariff costs. Therefore, we are not raising our operating margin guidance and we are reiterating our expectation that our full year operating margin will be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%. Since we last gave guidance, the tariff environment has evolved. Specifically, our incremental tariff rates have doubled since our Q1 earnings call. Jeff will walk you through more details around our updated guidance. I would like to update you now on our tariff mitigation efforts. We continue to be actively and aggressively mitigating what we can with our 6-point plan.\nFirst, we are successfully obtaining cost concessions from our strong vendor community. This includes reductions on current products, but also reductions in price on the newness that we are bringing in and developing. Second, we are actively resourcing goods to get the best cost for our customers. Third, we are identifying further supply chain efficiencies in our network. Fourth, we are optimizing expense through tight cost control and financial discipline. Fifth, we are expanding our made in the USA assortment, production and partnerships. And lastly, we are carefully taking select price increases on products with a focus on maintaining competitive pricing. We expect the next time we talk about tariff with you, the landscape may be different. But for today, all effective tariffs are reflected in our updated guidance.\nNow let's review our brands. Pottery Barn ran a positive 1.1% comp in Q2, and since 2019, the brand ran a 42.6% comp. Pottery Barn is executing its strategy to step up innovation, provide better value, improve channel experiences and reduce promotions and we are pleased with the initial reads of our fall launch. In particular, customers continue to respond to our innovation in proprietary design and furniture. Our Pottery Barn stores are a key part of our success and continue to outperform. Customers have shown their love for the in-store shopping experience. and we have responded by focusing on improving retail inventory availability, refreshing product assortments and enhancing design services. We are pleased to see our strategies working at Pottery Barn. We believe the brand will continue to improve its sales trend through increased newness, exciting brand collaborations and strong design services.\nNow I'd like to talk to you about our Pottery Barn children's business, which ran a 5.3% comp in Q2, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comps. And since 2019, Pottery Barn Kids and team ran a 25.9% comp. Innovation across our product offering and the shopping experience has been key to delivering this growth. The children's business continues to see strong response to our new product launches as we address evolving trends in furniture and decor, and our effective collaborations are driving demand and new customer growth. In these life-stage brands, the journey starts with baby. In the baby business, we delivered growth in nursery furniture and our expanded offering of Keepsake gifts.\nMoving to our back-to-school business, which has been strong. We are focused on offering high-quality gear at-home study solutions and everything students need for the dorm. We continue to acquire new customers with our dorm decorating solutions, market-leading quality and exclusive collaborations. We are making shopping easier through our enhanced pickup near campus program. Our customers can ship to any of our over 450 Williams-Sonoma Inc. stores nearest to their school. Additionally, we've expanded our offering in store and provide free design services for Dorm. And in the quarter, we acquired the intellectual property of Dormify which we believe will expand our presence in the dorm space as we develop it as our tenth brand.\nAs we look to the balance of the year, we feel confident in our pipeline of product innovation and our consistent brand promise. We continue to focus on quality, sustainable goods that are built to last over the childhood years at a compelling value. Now let's review West Elm. West Elm ran a positive 3.3% comp in Q2. Since 2019, West Elm has grown 41.9%. We continue to make progress against the brand's 4 key pillars: product, branch channel excellence and operational efficiencies. In Q2, West Elm drove positive comps in both furniture and non-furniture. Product innovation is driving strong performance with newness up double digits year-over-year. Fall is on track to be the brand's most successful launch of the year with standout collections across all categories.\nCollaborations are also an important part of West Elm's growth. The brand's collaboration with award-winning designers, [ Pearson Ward ], continued to be a huge success throughout Q2. This collection is West Elm's top-selling collaboration to date. The codesigned line received widespread of claim earning top-tier press coverage. Also in July, the brand launched their second kids collaboration with Joseph Alta zero. We're excited by the momentum at West Elm. Their growth strategy is working, and we have a sizable opportunity for this brand. Now let's review the Williams-Sonoma brand. We're thrilled to report the brand's third consecutive quarter of positive comps, running a 5.1% comp. And since 2019, the brand ran a 39.9% comp. Our design-led approach and exclusive partnerships continue to expand our market reach and relevance. Customers are responding to our inspirational product stories with amazing chefs and innovative product launches to introduce color into their kitchens as well as new technologies from chef-driven collaborations to the ongoing success of [indiscernible] exclusive products we are providing our customers with what they want.\nWe're thrilled to build on this momentum with additional launches planned for the second half of the year across all categories. I also want to mention that in early July, we kicked off our annual fundraising with No Kid Hungry to support their fight against childhood hunger in America. And to date, we have raised over $20 million for No Kid Hungry to customer donations, events, and our tools for change collection of spatulas designed by celebrities, chefs and influencers. I want to thank everyone that has helped us raise both money and awareness for this very important cause. Turning to the Williams-Sonoma Home business. Strong launches in lighting textiles and decor partially offset softness in the furniture this quarter. In Q2, all non-furniture categories grew, demonstrating our ability to provide elevated decorating updates for the home. Now I'd like to update you on B2B growing 10% in Q2, with both trade and contract delivering double-digit comps.\nLeveraging our design expertise and commercial-grade product assortment, we've built a strong and growing client base across multiple industries. Our B2B offering remains a powerful differentiator, and we are seeing continued momentum. Now I'd like to update you on our emerging brands which continue to drive strong growth and profitability. Rejuvenation delivered another strong quarter of growth with double-digit comps. The brand's strong performance continues to be fueled by strength in core renovation categories. and product innovation continues to drive growth. In Q2, we expanded finishes across categories, introduced new statement lighting collections and size options to our vanities and bath hardware to better meet project needs. We also see strong demand in newer hardware categories. Rejuvenation is well positioned to sustain growth through the second half of 2025 and beyond.\nMark and Graham ended the quarter with strong momentum also driven by ongoing growth in their new baby and pet categories, along with the successful launch of their new back-to-school and early fall collections. As we head into the holiday selling season, corporate gifting becomes a larger focus for the brand, and we're excited by the potential of this great business. Now turning to our newest and smallest brand, Green row. The brand delivered strong growth in Q2, driven by increased demand for core vintage-inspired furniture collections, printed upholstery fabrics and a launch of full newness in June.\nGreenRow continues to innovate with new materials, thoughtful collaboration and uniquely optimistic products. The product line is incredibly beautiful in person, and we are actively looking for a couple of store locations to test this concept at retail. Last, I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue to deliver strong performance across our strategic global markets, including Canada, Mexico, India and the U.K. In Canada, both retail and DTC channels are outperforming, supported by a differentiated product offering and enhanced omnichannel strategy and the expansion of our B2B program. In Mexico, where we partner with Liverpool, results remained strong, driven by the success of our expanded summer assortment and strategic growth in the design and trade business.\nIn India, where we work with Reliance, growth is driven by new marketing initiatives that are driving brand awareness. And in the U.K. we are leveraging strong trade segment momentum while executing against our plan for the upcoming online launch of Pottery Barn U.K. this fall. In summary, we are proud of our strong execution and outperformance in Q2 with accelerating positive comps and strong profitability. The current level of macroeconomic uncertainty does not distract us from our focus and determination. Across the company, we are all committed to improving our channel experiences and building strong brands. Every day, we come to work with a focus on innovation, product design and customer service, which differentiates us across the industry.\nThis differentiation allows us to shine in this highly fragmented industry and ultimately positions us to pick up market share with our 3 key priorities: returning to growth, enhancing our world-class customer service and driving earnings we are set up well to continue executing in 2025 and beyond. And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter exceeded our expectations on both the top and the bottom line. Here are some key highlights from Q2. All brands delivered positive comps for the second straight quarter.

Our results would not be possible without the talented team we have at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. I'd like to thank our team for their relentless dedication to delivering strong financial results and outstanding customer service. Our team is the best in retail. Now let's get to the numbers. I'll start with our Q2 results and then cover guidance for fiscal year '25. Q2 net revenue finished at $1.84 billion. Our revenues exceeded the high end of our expectations at a positive 3.7% comp. We gained market share in the quarter even as we increased our penetration of full price selling.\nAll brands delivered positive comps for the second consecutive quarter, driven by positive comps in both our furniture and non-furniture categories. From a channel perspective, both the retail and e-commerce channels delivered positive comps with retail up 7.3% comp and e-commerce up 2% comp. Both channels benefited from improved in-stock from our higher inventory levels. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin exceeded our expectations, coming in at 47.1%, 220 basis points higher than last year. Merchandise margin accounted for 190 basis points of our gross margin improvement. Select price increases and higher full price selling drove this improvement. Our Q2 results saw a minimal impact from tariffs due to our tariff mitigation efforts, including the front-loading of lower tariff receipts in Q1. Supply chain efficiencies drove the remaining 30 basis points of improvement in our gross margin.\nWe continue to realize expense savings across manufacturing, warehousing and delivery from our focus on customer experience and efficiency. Key metrics, including returns, accommodations, damages, replacements and outbound shipping expense continued to improve year-over-year. Occupancy costs, although up 2.1% on a dollar basis, were essentially flat as a percent of revenue. Overall, our gross margin this quarter exceeded our expectations. Turning now to SG&A. Our SG&A ran at 29.2% of revenues, 20 basis points lower than last year. Employment expense deleveraged 100 basis points, primarily due to higher incentive compensation from our strong results this quarter. We continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers in line with top line trends. Advertising expense was 80 basis points lower year-over-year. Our in-house marketing team drove more customer engagement and strong sales with less advertising spend.\nGeneral expenses leveraged 40 basis points from our higher revenues and are keeping a tight lid on expenses. On the bottom line, our earnings exceeded our expectations. Operating income grew 18% to $328 million. Operating margin at 17.9% was 240 basis points above last year, and diluted earnings per share grew nearly 20% year-over-year to $2. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $986 million with no outstanding debt. We generated $283 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, invested $52 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth and returned $280 million to our shareholders through $199 million in stock repurchases and $81 million in dividends.\nMerchandise inventory stood at $1.4 billion, up 17.7% to last year. Our inventory includes $70 million of a strategic pull forward of receipts at lower tariff rates than expected later in fiscal year '25. And of incremental tariff costs recorded in inventory. Overall, our inventory level and composition are well positioned to support our sales growth. Turning up our Q2. We're proud to deliver results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and the bottom line. Now let's turn to our guidance for fiscal year '25. First, some housekeeping. Fiscal year '24 was a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma. In fiscal year '25, we will report costs on a 52-week versus 52-week comparable basis.\nAll other year-over-year compares will be 52 weeks versus 53 weeks. The additional week contributed 150 basis points to revenue growth and 20 basis points to operating margin to fiscal year '24 results, Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we recorded a $49 million out-of-period adjustment related to prior year freight accruals. This benefited fiscal year '24 operating margin results by approximately 70 basis points. Our guidance for fiscal year '25 will use our fiscal year '24 results without the out-period adjustment than the comparable basis. As we turn to guidance for fiscal year '25, we remain focused on what we can control, executing our 3 key priorities: returning to growth elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We're confident in our growth strategy, and we are encouraged by the momentum in our business.\nOn the top line, we are raising our fiscal year '25 net revenue guidance. We now expect full year '25 comp to be in the range of positive 2% to positive 5%. And with total net revenues in the range of positive 0.5% to positive 3.5% due to the 53rd lease impact from last year. Our guidance assumes no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment or interest rates or housing turnover. Our higher guide reflects the continued strength in our business. strong customer response to our newness and innovation and continued traction across our key growth initiatives. On the bottom line, we are reiterating our full year operating margin guidance of 17.4% to 17.8%. The flow-through from our higher revenue will be offset by both the tariffs announced in our last earnings call and the flexibility we are giving ourselves to protect our key priorities of growth in service.\nRegarding tariffs. Our incremental tariff rate has doubled since our last earnings call. At our May earnings call, our incremental tariff rate was 14%. As of today's call, it has doubled to 28%. This includes the additional 30% China tariffs, 50% India tariff, 20% via non-tariff and averaged 18% tariff on the rest of the world as well as the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs and a 50% copper tariff. We believe the strength of our operating model combined with the fifth point mitigation plan that Laura shared with me, enables us to maintain our guidance despite the doubling of tariffs since our last earnings call. Our guidance reflects our best estimate of the impact based upon the tariffs in place as of this call. Given our strong performance this year and our raising top line guidance, we would expect there to be incremental earnings flow through on the year.\nHowever, tariff policy has been volatile and subject to multiple revisions. It's hard to say where tariffs will ultimately land and what impact it will have on our business. As we navigate this uncertainty, we intend to stay focused on growth and service. Reiterating our operating margin guidance gives us the flexibility to protect these key priorities. The key point here is we are raising our top line guidance based upon momentum in our business. In reiterating our bottom line guidance, to give us flexibility as we navigate the tariff uncertainty. Also today, we are providing some further input for modeling purposes. We expect our full year interest income to be approximately $30 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5%.\nTurning now to capital allocation. Our plans for fiscal year '25 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in long-term growth. We expect to spend between $250 million and $275 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year '25. We intend to invest 85% of this capital spend on our e-commerce channel, retail optimization and supply chain efficiency. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payout and ongoing share repurchases. For dividend, we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.66 per share, which is a 15% increase year-over-year. We are proud to say that fiscal year '25 is the 16th consecutive year of increased dividend payout. For share repurchases, we have $900 million available under our share repurchase authorization through which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to provide returns to our shareholders.\nLooking further into the future beyond '25, we are reiterating our long-term guidance mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, with operating margins in the mid- to high teens. Wrapping up Laura's and my comments, we're proud to deliver another quarter of strong results for our shareholders that exceeded expectations. While tariff policy has produced uncertainty and headwind. We are encouraged by the momentum we see in our business. Our focus remains on our 3 key priorities: returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We are confident we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 weeks, they remain consistent.\nOur ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishing the strength of our in-house proprietary design. The competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy. the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resilience of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions."

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, Chief Accounting Officer & Head of IR\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including annual guidance for fiscal '25 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. .\nThe company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'm excited to talk to you about our results today. Before we get into our results, I'd like to acknowledge the accomplishments of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. The results we are about to share with you today reflect their creativity, focus and hard work.\nWe are proud with our strong finish to 2024. And -- in Q4, our comp came in above expectations at positive 3.1%. Also in the quarter, we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 21.5% and -- and earnings per share of $3.28. In Q4, we saw acceleration in our comp trend despite no material improvement in the housing market. After many quarters of running negative comps, our total comp was positive, and I want to say it again, our total comp was positive 3.1% in Q4, and we outperformed the industry decline of 2% in the quarter.\nThis outperformance was driven by a strong seasonal assortment, effective collaborations and improvement in furniture sales and strong performance in both retail and online.\nTurning to the full year. Our comps ran down 1.6% and -- with a 5-year comp at 34% positive. In 2024, we delivered a record annual operating margin of 17.9% with full year earnings per share of $8.50. A -- we hit our 2024 annual guidance, which we raised twice in 2024, and we beat Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. This performance was due to the strength of our operating model, our supply chain efficiencies, our focus on full price selling and cost control from our company-wide financial discipline.\nAs we enter 2025, we are confident that we've laid the foundation for growth and profitability. Even though there are significant macro and geopolitical uncertainties, we are focused on our strategies to deliver in 2025 and beyond.\nNow let's talk about what those strategies include: First, we believe we will deliver for brand growth due to increased levels of newness and exciting innovation. We are able to differentiate ourselves competitively through our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization. These differentiators give us a unique ability to offer high-quality products at compelling price points.\nAlso, we recognize housing may not improve this year, and therefore, a key component of our growth strategy is our robust nonfurniture assortment that includes inspirational, seasonal and decorative accessories, textiles and housewares. We believe this puts us in a much better competitive position than our peers who are overly dependent on furniture.\nA key part of our strategy is our outside partnerships and collaborations. These exciting partnerships like Monique Lhuillier in Pottery Barn, LoveShackFancy in our children's business, Stanley Tucci and our Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business and Marcus Samuelsson in West Elm attract new customers and drive sales with our current customers.\nNext, B2B is an important growth driver. B2B leverages our strength in design and commercial-grade product offerings. And we have built an incredible book of business the last few years in the commercial space and several industry verticals. We -- our offering of design to delivery services is a competitive advantage as we continue to build our project pipeline. And we are off to a strong start with new customers this year.\nAnother component of our growth will come from the expansion of our emerging brands, Rejuvenation, GreenRow, Williams-Sonoma Home and Mark & Graham. We have the in-house competency and ability to incubate and build new brands. And let me remind you that all of our brands, even our largest, Pottery Barn or once emerging brands.\nIn addition to these growth strategies, we are focused on offering the best channel experiences. A key investment we are making is in our next generation of design services. The new tools we have launched online and in-stores assist our customers in developing design plans for any style or size of home, and we continue to improve these tools. For example, in Q4, we launched our proprietary Shop By Style functionality, which we'll be rolling out across all of our brands.\nWe are also incorporating AI into our digital capabilities like personalized e-mails and customized homepages. We believe we'll be a leader in the use of AI in our operations and in our industry and the AI will be a key component in driving record sales and margin.\nAlso, we are continuing to see improved performance in our stores. Our positive comp in Q4 was primarily driven by retail, as a result of our enhanced in-store experience with inspiring new products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next level design services and events.\nWe continue to unlock the power of our omnichannel services, and this is another area where we are using AI to optimize sales, cost and delivery speed.\nIn 2025, we'll also continue our progress in delivering world-class customer service, the perfect order, damage-free, on time, every time. Even with metrics better than before the pandemic and, in some cases, record-breaking our supply chain team continues to challenge the status quo and come up with new ways to reduce costs.\nIn 2025, we will continue to limit out of market and multiple shipments to reduce customer accommodations, to lower returns and damages and to reduce replacements. This part of retail execution is often overlooked but is the key to profitability and customer satisfaction. We believe 2025 will be a year of additional optimization and efficiency, particularly in our new distribution center in Arizona, where we have more to go in terms of unlocking the benefits of cost efficiencies and -- and faster, more automated deliveries.\nMoving to other earnings drivers. We will be tight on employment in 2025 with a focus on using AI to offset head count growth. Also, in marketing, there is opportunity this year to leverage spend by using efficiencies in our in-house marketing program. In total, we are optimistic for 2025, and -- we are focused on driving positive comps and expanding operational improvements. Even in a difficult environment, our initiatives are gaining momentum, and we are optimistic and confident about our business. Our focus will remain on our 3 key priorities: returning to growth, enhancing customer service and driving earnings.\nTurning to guidance. Let's spend a minute talking about our assumptions. We aren't planning for any significant upside or downside from the external macro environment. Our guidance reflects what we know today, incorporating our initiatives and the current tariffs of China at 20%, and -- Mexico and Canada at 25% and the additional tariffs on metals and aluminum was 25%.\nOur guidance does not include any additional tariffs nor does it include a housing recovery. For 2025, we are guiding our comps to be flat to positive 3%, with operating margin between 17.4% and 17.8%.\nNow let's review our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 0.5% comp in Q4, substantially improving over Q3. On a 5-year basis, the brand ran a positive 37.6% comp. In 2024, Pottery Barn significantly reduced promotional activity, improving margin and setting the groundwork for growth with new product introductions and increased collaborations. Looking to 2025, the brand has an exciting lineup of Monique and noteworthy collaborations with industry leaders like LoveShackFancy that launches very soon, and we are building on our successful new furniture launches and have an expanded outdoor assortment.\nAlso, we are uniquely positioned in the market with our leading products in seasonal decorating and entertaining and our innovation in textiles and our strength in print and pattern continues. In 2025, another competitive advantage for Pottery Barn is to leverage our domestic upholstery capabilities located in the Southeastern United States. Our Sutter facilities offer high-quality manufacturing with industry-leading delivery times. Sutter services all of our brands, but Potter Barn has the highest percent to total.\nNow I'd like to talk to you about our Pottery Barn Children's home furnishing brand, which went a positive 3.5% comp in Q4 with a 5-year comp of 24.6%. In 2024, kids and teams together ran positive comps every quarter. Success has been driven by our key growth drivers, dorm, baby and collabs. In Q4, we saw record results from our expanded seasonal decor offering as customers came to our children's brands to celebrate the holidays, give gifts and decorate nurseries and dorm rooms.\nProduct collaborations were another highlight with particular strength in the LoveShackFancy, Chris loves Julia and Rifle Paper, collections. Looking to 2025, we've built a powerful pipeline of newness and newsworthy launches. We recently launched Modern Baby and Pottery Barn Kids, offering a fresh aesthetic to the brand. In weeks ahead, our Pottery Barn Dorm collection will also launch with new looks and a dramatically expanded assortment.\nNow let's review West Elm. We are thrilled to report a substantial improvement in comp to positive 4.2% in Q4. On a 5-year basis, the brand ran a 21.7% comp, we have made strong progress against our 4 key pillars: product, brand, channel excellence and operational efficiencies. We -- in Q4, Holiday Newness drove double-digit positive comps with strength in both furniture newness and holiday seasonal textiles and decorative accessories and tabletops. We saw improvement in furniture as high-performing new collections came back in stock, also letting with a particular strength for West Elm in Q4.\nNow let's review the Williams-Sonoma brand. We are thrilled to report a substantial improvement in comp to positive 5.7%. On a 5-year basis, the brand ran a 35.5% comp. The Williams-Sonoma brand built on last year's success with another strong year, driven by retail execution, product innovation, dynamic marketing and collaborations.\nIn Q4, the product assortment for Williams-Sonoma was stacked with great gifts and a complete offering for holiday hosting and entertaining. We saw strength in the cookware, cutlery and electrics categories, led by newness and the popularity of key core items. Our seasonal and decorative accessories also drove results for the baker, tabletop, housewares, food and garden businesses. We continue to welcome customers into our stores with exciting events like celebrity chef book signings.\nThe 100th book signing event of 2024 for Williams-Sonoma was held in Q4 and at our Columbus Circle store, and it was coincidentally a sold-out launch party for Martha Stewart's 100th CookBook. Our team was also on site managing the book sales at sold-out auditoriums across the country for Ina Garten's book tour, and we're excited for even more events with our amazing chef partners in 2025. We -- in 2025, we'll continue to celebrate food from around the world. A great example is our Japanese-inspired tabletop collection currently in store along with our new food collaboration with Celebrity Chef Morimoto.\nNow I'd like to update you on B2B. Business-to-business had an exciting and record-breaking year, driving more than $1 billion in revenues for the 10 comp with both trade and contract growing in both Q4 and the full year. Q4 represented Contracts largest quarter history to date, driving a 12% comp for the quarter. Our multichannel program and our leading assortment of contract-grade products have been key drivers in our accelerated large project growth. Key project wins include our first furniture order for a cruise ship Royal Caribbean's Utopia of the Seas, hospitality work for the Ritz-Carlton, Kimpton, W Hotels and Sheraton and continued momentum in the multifamily space with the related companies and Korman communities. We're excited about the opportunity that B2B has to disrupt an underserved and highly fragmented market.\nLastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. As I mentioned earlier, Williams-Sonoma has a long history of creating brands and building them into big businesses, like we did with West Elm from a concept in 2002 to an almost $2 billion business today. We are pleased with the performance of our smaller emerging brands like Mark & Graham and GreenRow, which had strong positive comps in the quarter. But today, I want to focus on Rejuvenation.\nOur Rejuvenation brand continues to exceed our expectations with another quarter of double-digit growth. In fact, in the last 5 years, Rejuvenation has driven positive comps in 17 and -- of those 20 quarters, and the business has almost doubled since 2020. In 2024, Rejuvenation's growth was driven by innovative domestically designed handmade products. Core categories, including cabinet hardware, bath hardware and lighting performed exceptionally well. And growth categories such as bath vanities, plumbing, window hardware and organization delivered double-digit comps.\nLooking ahead to 2025 and beyond, Rejuvenation is well positioned for continued momentum. We currently have 11 stores and are actively looking for new locations. We believe Rejuvenation will be our next $1 billion brand.\nWe are also encouraged by the improvement of the Williams-Sonoma Home business. We continue to expand products across categories with introductions of exclusive in-house designs in lighting, textiles and accessories as well as collaborations. We see an opportunity to disrupt the high-end home furnishings market where no key players offer print and pattern like we do.\nLast, I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue to see strength in our key growth markets, including Canada, Mexico and India. The Canada business continues to grow, fueled by our commitment to enhancing the customer experience, both online and in retail. In Mexico, the holiday season saw continued growth in sales and market share driven by our inspiring product assortments and personalized service. Our business in India continues to grow, driven by excellence in design services for both retail and e-commerce. And our U.K. business continues to grow as we strengthen our partnerships with John Lewis for West Elm, Pottery Bran Kids and Potter and Leatham for Williams-Sonoma.\nIn summary, we are proud of our strong execution and outperformance in 2024. Despite an uncertain backdrop, we have been and will continue to be focused on returning growth, enhancing our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We are innovators and operators, and we are set up for a great 2025. Before I hand it over to Jeff, I also want to take a minute to say thank you again to our associates, but also to our vendors and to you, our shareholders, your continued dedication and support is appreciated.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We are proud to have delivered a strong finish to fiscal year '24, with both Q4 and full year '24 earnings exceeding expectations. Our results reflect the 3 key priorities we focused on in '24. First, returning to growth, as our top line improved to a positive 3.1% comp in Q4, we -- driven by innovation and newness across our core brands, strong comps in our emerging brands and double-digit growth in business to business. Second, elevating our world-class customer service as our supply chain team once again produced efficiencies and, most importantly, improved customer service. And third, our focus on driving earnings as we delivered record operating margin and double-digit EPS growth in both Q4 and the full year.\nOur results this quarter demonstrate the flexibility, strength and durability of our operating model to drive market share gains and deliver highly profitable earnings in almost any environment.\nNow let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q4 results, followed by our full fiscal year '24 results, then provide guidance for '25. As a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc, so our fourth quarter consisted of 14 weeks. We are reporting our comps on a 14-week versus 14-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares are 14 weeks versus 13 weeks.\nIn Q4, the additional week contributed 510 basis points to revenue growth and 60 basis points to operating margins. Q4 net revenue finished at $2.5 billion, with a positive 3.1% comp. Our revenues came in above the high end of our expectations, driven primarily by strong holiday performance across our portfolio of brands and substantially improved trends in our furniture business.\nDuring the quarter, we gained market share even as we increased our penetration of full price selling. From a channel perspective, our retail stores delivered a positive 7% comp and e-commerce, a positive 1.3% comp.\nMoving down the income statement. Q4 gross margin came in at 47.3%, 130 basis points higher than last year. There were 3 main drivers behind us: Merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy. First, merchandise margins improved 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting lower input costs,and our continued focus on full price selling.\nSecond, supply chain efficiency delivered another 10 basis points of savings in Q4. We -- we continue to realize expense savings across the supply chain from our focus on the customer experience and efficiency in manufacturing, warehousing and delivery. Key metrics, including returns, accommodations, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order continued to improve year-over-year.\nAnd third, Occupancy costs were down 2% from last year and leveraged 80 basis points. Our higher top line leveraged occupancy across both retail and e-commerce. Overall, our higher gross margin this quarter exceeded our expectations.\nTurning now to SG&A. Our Q4 SG&A have been at 25.8% of revenue,s, 10 basis points lower than last year. Q4 employment expense was 80 basis points higher year-over-year, primarily from higher performance-based incentive compensation due to our strong EPS performance. In Q4, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our retail stores, distribution centers and care centers in line with revenues.\nQ4 Advertising expense was 30 basis points higher year-over-year. Our multibrand portfolio allows us to test into incremental spending, while our data-driven marketing team maximizes the effectiveness of our investment and keep valuable insights in-house. Our advertising model is a powerful competitive advantage.\nQ4 general expenses drove the balance of the leverage in SG&A due to our resolution of an indirect tax matter and a favorable insurance settlement.\nOn the bottom line, our Q4 operating margin came in at a record 21.5% or 140 basis points above last year. Q4 diluted earnings per share of $3.28 and -- increased 20.6% above last year.\nTurning now to our full year results, which again exceeded expectations. Full year net revenues finished at $7.7 billion, with a full year comp of negative 1.6%. Importantly, our comp trends gained momentum across the year. That was driven by the ongoing strength in our nonfurniture categories, coupled with the improved trend in our Furniture business.\nFrom a channel perspective, our retail stores delivered a positive 0.2% comp and e-commerce, a negative 2.5% comp. E-commerce on the full year continued to constitute nearly 66% of total revenues.\nFull year gross margin ended at 46.5%, a 380 basis point improvement over last year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of fiscal year '24, we recorded a $49 million out-of-period adjustment related to freight accruals, the benefited operating margin results by approximately 70 basis points on the full year. Without the Q1 out-of-period adjustment, full year gross margin ended at 45.8%. This 310 basis point improvement was driven by higher merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy leverage.\nFull year SG&A expense increased to 27.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. Higher employment and advertising expense was partially offset by slightly lower general expenses on the full year.\nOn the bottom line, we delivered earnings exceeding expectations. Including the out-of-period adjustment in Q1, full year operating margin finished at 18.6% with full year diluted earnings per share of $8.79. We -- without the out-of-period adjustment in Q1, full year operating margin finished at a record 17.9% and full year diluted earnings per share increased to $8.50, a -- up 14.4% year-over-year.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.2 billion with no debt outstanding. Merchandise inventories stood at $1.3 billion, up 6.9% to last year. Included in our year-end inventory levels is a strategic pull-forward China receipts to reduce the potential impact of higher tariffs in fiscal year '25.\nNow turning to capital allocation. In 2024, we generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion and returned nearly $1.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases in '24 totaled $807 million, or 4.6% of our outstanding shares. And we paid $280 million in dividends to our shareholders, a 20% increase year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures in '24 totaled $222 million as we continue to invest in our long-term growth. Speaking of returns, our fiscal year '24 return on invested capital of 54% is among the best in the retail industry.\nSumming up our '24 results, we are proud to have delivered strong earnings for our shareholders. These results reflect the efforts of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc., and I'd like to thank our talented team for delivering these outstanding results.\nNow let's turn to our '25 outlook. First, some housekeeping. As I've mentioned, 2024 was a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. In fiscal year '25, we'll report comps on a 52-week versus 52-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 52 weeks versus 53 weeks. The additional week contributed 150 basis points to revenue growth and 20 basis points to operating margin to full year '24 results.\nAdditionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year '24, we recorded a $49 million out-of-trade adjustment related to freight accruals that benefited operating margin results by approximately 290 basis points in Q1 and 70 basis points on the full year. Our guidance for fiscal year '25 will use our fiscal year '24 results without the out-of-period adjustment as a comparable basis.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '25, the macroeconomic and policy environment is unpredictable. Our focus is on what we can control, executing on our 3 key priorities: returning to growth, elevating our world-class service and driving earnings. We're confident in our growth strategies, and we see opportunity to drive earnings from additional supply chain efficiency and savings across SG&A.\nOur guidance assumes no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment or interest rates or housing turnover. We expect 2025 net revenue comps to be in the range of flat to positive 3%, with total net revenues in the range of down 1.5% to positive 1.5% due to the 53rd week impact from '24.\nWe anticipate operating margins will be between 17.4% and 17.8%, inclusive of the 20 basis points impact from the 53rd week.\nRegarding tariffs. Our operating margin guidance includes the tariff increases implemented as of this call. Specifically, our guidance includes the additional 20% China tariffs, the 25% Mexico and Canada tariffs and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. With these tariffs included, we expect operating margin for fiscal year '25 and -- to be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%. If tariff policy changes, we may need to revisit our guidance estimates.\nNow turning to capital allocation. Our capital allocation plans for '25 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in long-term growth. We expect to spend between $275 million and $300 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year '25. 85% of this capital spend will be dedicated to driving our leadership in e-commerce, our retail optimization and supply chain efficiency.\nWe remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. We -- for dividends, today, we announced our Board of Directors authorized a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend payout to $0.66 per share. Fiscal year '25 will be the 16th consecutive year of increased dividend payout, which we are both proud of and remain committed to.\nFor share repurchases, we have $1.2 billion available under our share repurchase authorization through which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders.\nLooking further into the future beyond '25, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins in the mid- to high teens. Wrapping up Laura's and my comments, we are proud to have delivered strong results for our shareholders that exceeded expectations, and we are encouraged by the momentum in our business.\nWilliams-Sonoma, Inc. remains focused on our 3 key priorities: returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 reasons that remain consistent. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions."

Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we review our Q2 results, I want to take a minute to recognize our team for their continued contributions. We recently held our General Managers Conference in Arizona. It was our first leadership conference since the pandemic, and all of us have been inspired by the level of passion, dedication and talent of our store management and field teams.\nToday, we are reporting strong results for the second quarter of 2024, which were driven by our Q2 improved top line trends, market share gains and continued delivery on our commitment to profitability. In Q2, our comps came in at negative 3.3%, and we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 16.2%, and earnings per share of $1.74, reflecting the 2-for-1 stock split we completed in July.\nWe are pleased with our strong operating results and the operational improvements that produced these results. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our margin profile even in a difficult market. There is no doubt that the home furnishings market is challenged due to the uncertainty in the economy, coupled with slow housing. This leads us to believe that we may not see the back half acceleration that we expected despite all of the hard work we've done to improve our product offer and our customer experience. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to reduce our top line outlook for the balance of the year while continuing to deliver on our commitment to profitability and, in fact, we are raising our bottom line guidance. We are now expecting full year revenues to come in a range of down 4% to down 1.5%, but we are raising our guidance on operating margin to be in the range of 17.4% and to 17.8%. Now let me review progress on our 3 key priorities that we outlined with you back in March. First, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and third, driving margin. I'll start with an update on returning to growth. Our improved top line trends outperformed the industry decline in the second quarter, and we maintained our commitment to not offering site-wide promotions. A key element of our return to growth strategy is our focus on innovation in our product lines across brands, including substantially more newness across our assortments. And our unique in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization allows us to offer this high-quality design innovation at compelling price points.\nThe next key component of our return to growth strategy is our commitment to improving our channel experiences. Our investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology serves as a competitive advantage versus our peers. From product discovery and selection to personalization, content, customer care and the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how to elevate and evolve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. In the quarter, we've been focused on expanding our online content and providing more inspiration in the shop pass to drive conversion. And of course, we cannot forget our best-in-class retail business. We have continued to improve our in-store experience with integrational new products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next-level design services, including our new design tool that allows for 3D rendering. As our team's reminded us at our general managers conference this year, we really do have about team in retail. And our retail optimization efforts continue transforming our store fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations.\nNow let's talk through progress on our second and third key priority, which goes hand in hand. We continue to make progress improving our world-class customer service and driving margins, contributing significantly to the operating margin we reported today. One of the foundational principles upon which this company is built is that the customer is at the center of everything we do, and their satisfaction is key to our operating performance. Without our customers, truly nothing else matters. And in Q2, we continued to make meaningful improvements in our customer service metrics.\nThe supply chain team continues to reduce costs by eliminating out-of-market and then multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacement. And our ongoing commitment to not running site-wise promotions and the reduction of our promotional offerings have improved margins. We are focused on delivering a compelling value equation to our customers, which in turn maximizes our full price selling.\nNow I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 7.1% comp in Q2. Improvements in trends were driven by our compelling product assortments in [indiscernible] decorating and entertaining and seasonal holidays. We saw success in our new summer furniture launches and are optimistic about our fall furniture newness with a focus on proprietary finishes and design.\nLooking ahead to the back half, we have a strong holiday lineup that is off to a great start. There is no one else like us in the market with the incredible assortment of seasonal decorating for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanaka, and we are building on successful new programs that we have launched. The Pottery Barn children's business ran a positive 1.5% comp in Q2, a continuation of our positive comp trend in the first quarter of the year. Innovation across our product offering and improvement in the shopping experience have been key to delivering this growth. And these life stage brands back-to-school was a highlight, with dorm driving double-digit growth. In this space, we continue to attract new customers with our market-leading design, excellent quality and sustainability promise.\nWe have bolstered the shopping experience with a suite of digital shopping tools and expanded in-store services, including free dorm design services and convenient shipping options to any of our stores near campuses.\nProduct collaborations also continue to drive sales with existing and new customers. We're especially pleased with our recent collaboration with RolloRabbit, and we are seeing continued success with LoveShackFancy.\nNow let's review West Elm, which we had a negative 4.8% comp in Q2. The brand continues to see success in new product introductions with both summer and fall newness driving double-digit positive comp to last year. And this month, we are thrilled to drop our first catalog in the brand since holiday 2021. Additionally, West Elm launched a very exciting second collaboration with a fashion brand, Road, following a successful debut last year. This new collection features 120 pieces, including a relaunch of past favorites combined with new textiles, tabletop, lighting, decorative accessories, bath, rugs and a collection of items designed for college dorms. This collaboration is on track to do more than double the initial launch last year.\nGiven the positive trends in newness and exciting collaborations in the pipeline, we have a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products.\nThe Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 0.8% comp in Q2. In the quarter, we benefited from the performance of our new and exclusive products, offset by some tough compares in electric. Sales from summer newness were up double digits to last year, and we're seeing strength in new and premium products found only at Williams-Sonoma. The strategy to offer our customers quality product they can't find anywhere else is working, and we are excited about our robust second half lineup of in-house design products and exclusive. Williams-Sonoma brand remains focused on delivering immersive culinary experiences in-store, online and at key events across the country. In store, we've inspired thousands of customers through our Sunday Skill series and demos teaching customers from how to [indiscernible] to make ice cream. Our tools for change campaign supporting No Kid Hungry celebrated its 10th anniversary this July. To date, we're proud to have raised over $16 million to help No Kid Hungry and end childhood hunger in America. We're grateful to all the chefs and celebrities that have contributed designs to our specials over the years. As we look to the second half, we will continue inspiring our customers to cook, coast and entertain for the holidays. This fall, the brand will launch the Art of Entertaining, where customers can benefit from expert advice on everything from setting a table to hosting a dinner party to floral arranging techniques and to napkin-folding tricks. We believe this focus on holidays and celebrations will not just drive volume in key categories, but also cement the brand as the ultimate celebration destination in retail for new and existing customers.\nAnd lastly, we're excited by the momentum of our Williams-Sonoma Home business, which ran a slight positive comp in Q2.\nNow I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business to business continued its momentum in Q2, growing 11.5%, with record quarterly contract volume growing 21.6% while trade grew 7.1%. The hospitality space remains strong with notable wins at the Sheraton Boston, the Hilton Beverly Hills, Renaissance, Las Vegas, and Under Canvas for the Yosemite location. We have launched a new brand standard program with IHG's Hotel Indigo brand being named a preferred vendor for lighting and upholstery categories. We're also seeing strong momentum in the multifamily space, including growing partnerships with Corman communities and the Discovery Land Company, and we are thrilled to partner with St. Jude to develop custom beds and night stands for their ranch for children project in Nevada.\nNow I'd like to talk about our global business. While we continue to navigate global macroeconomic pressures, our strategic initiatives are delivering positive results across key strategic markets, including India, Canada and Mexico. The Canadian market continues to show strength, driven by growth from enhanced design services, emerging brands and omnichannel services. In Mexico, we are optimistic about our brand's performance in the market, with strength driven by all brands, with the most significant contribution coming from PB Kids. We'll be opening 2 new stores by the end of the year and 3 more set to open in early 2025. And finally, India remains a key area of growth for us. We're excited to expand the West Elm brand with 2 additional locations in new markets by the end of the year. Overall, our assortment, market and service strategies are the differentiators for continued growth in our global markets.\nLastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered another double-digit quarter. We're very optimistic about Rejuvenation's performance with 4 consecutive quarters of positive comps. Their unwavering focus on delivering the highest quality products has allowed them to gain market share. The trend of home updates, particularly in kitchens and bathrooms, continues with notable growth in cabinets and bath hardware and lighting. Additionally, our growth categories, including window hardware, textiles, home furnishings and organization solutions also performed well, providing our customers with the perfect finishing touches to complete their spaces.\nMark and Graham, our monogram gifting business, also drove a high double-digit growth in Q2. They saw success with our coastal and beach products for the homes and on-the-go, and had strong gifting sales in golf and personalized games. They've recently launched the Monogram Wedding Shop as well as Mark and Graham Kids, which will be an exciting incremental growth strategy for the brand. And finally, GreenRow, our newest brand, continues to grow and expand its affirmant of vintage-inspired colorful furnishings that are sustainably sourced and designed to last.\nThis month, GreenRow launched a new collection of thoughtfully made products, over 150 new items and a new catalog. The brand continues to innovate and create unique and differentiated products that fill a void in the market. We look forward to continued growth and exciting new products and partnerships in the coming months for GreenRow.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our strong operating results. Our revised outlook today reflects our prudent view of the top line and the confidence we have in our profitability profile. Despite the macro uncertainty, we remain focused on our key priorities for 2024 that are driving the results we announced today. During the last few years, we, as a company, have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have a strong omnichannel platform with an exclusive lifestyle offering and a sophisticated distribution network with additional capacity.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of strong results, highlighted by our Q2 improved top line trends, market share gains and earnings that continue to exceed expectations. Laura touched on our 3 key priorities for fiscal year '24. One, returning to growth, fueled by product innovation and channel experience; two, elevating our world-class service, which produces both customer retention and expense savings; and three, driving earnings as we continue to deliver strong profitability. These 3 priorities connect directly to the 5 key drivers underpinning our strong profitability in Q2.\nFirst, our e-commerce sales mix, with its higher operating margin sustaining at 66% of total revenues; second, our retail optimization strategy, delivering 3% less occupancy expense, inclusive of additional technology and supply chain investments; third, the pricing power of our in-house designed proprietary products, and our emphasis on full price selling, contributing to a 380-basis-point improvement in merchandise margins; fourth, our supply chain efficiency, from our relentless focus on customer service and operational excellence, producing 180 basis points improvement in selling margins; and fifth, our ability to control costs as we continue to manage variable employment costs materially in line with top line trends.\nGiven our strong Q2 results, we're confident we'll continue to gain market share and deliver strong earnings even in this uncertain environment.\nNow let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q2 results and then provide an update on guidance for '24. Net revenues finished at $1.79 billion, slightly below our expectations. We gained market share as our comp of negative 3.3% outperformed the industry, which declined by approximately 10%. Importantly, we accomplished this [ EBIT ] as we reduced our overall level of promotions in the quarter. Our Q2 comps improved from Q1, reflective of better performance in furniture and continued growth in our nonfurniture categories.\nFrom a cadence perspective, our trends across the quarter were choppy and inconsistent, reflecting the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.\nMoving down to the income statement, gross margin came in at 46.2%, 550 basis points higher than last year, and substantially exceeding expectations. There were 3 drivers to this 550-basis-point improvement, merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy costs. Let's start with merchandise margins, which improved 380 basis points. This improvement was driven by our ongoing commitment to full price selling, lower input costs and the residual benefit from lower inbound freight as we lapped last year's pandemic-related ocean freight runoff.\nNext, supply chain efficiencies contributed 180 basis points. Our commitment to full price selling is smoothing out the peaks and troughs created by promotional activity. This is yielding improved customer service, reduced customer lead times and significant cost savings from more efficient operations. Key customer service metrics, including returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order are all performing better than pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, we are seeing cost savings across the supply chain from more consistent operations, including warehouse, manufacturing and delivery expenses. And finally, occupancy costs, which were down 3% from last year deleveraged 10 basis points. We continue to optimize our retail fleet, while we invest in our world-class technology stack and our supply chain. During the quarter, we began operating our new Arizona distribution center. This fully automated facility will replace an outdated distribution center, improve service time to our customers and lower employment and shipping costs. Included in our occupancy cost this quarter were the cost of running both the new and old buildings, which will continue for the balance of fiscal year '24.\nWrapping up gross margin, we delivered substantially higher gross margin this quarter.\nTurning now to SG&A, which came in at 30% of revenues or 390 basis points higher than last year from higher employment expense and advertising spend. Employment expense was 200 basis points higher year-over-year, mostly from higher performance-based incentive compensation due to our strong EPS performance year-to-date. In Q2, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers, materially in line with top line trends.\nAdvertising expense deleveraged 150 basis points as we continue to invest into higher levels of advertising spend. Our multi-brand portfolio allows us to test the return of our incremental spend and our own hands-on keyboard approach allows our investment to go further and keeps our learnings in-house. Our advertising model is a key competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry. On the bottom line, our earnings once again exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $290 million, with operating margin at 16.2%, which was 160 basis points above last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.74, up $0.18 or 12% year-over-year.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion, with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $31 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned $203 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends.\nMerchandise inventories ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, down 4.1% to last year. Our inventory levels are in line with our top line trends and are well positioned to support our business.\nSumming up our Q2 results, we're proud to have delivered yet another quarter of earnings exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank our team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for delivering these great results. Our recent General Managers' Conference reminding me how our talented, dedicated team is the best in retail and the key to our success.\nNow let's turn to our '24 outlook. 2024 continues to be a challenging environment for home furnishings due to macroeconomic uncertainty in the slow housing market. This leads us to believe it's prudent to reduce our top line outlook for the balance of the year while raising our operating margin guidance as we continue to deliver on our commitment to profitability. It's important to note that our lower sales outlook is offset by our raised operating margin, producing materially similar implied EPS guidance. On the top line, we now expect full year '24 net revenues to be in the range of down 4% to down 1.5%, with comps between down 5.5% to down 3%. Our updated guidance reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty, combined with our choppy and inconsistent trends. With this backdrop in mind, we're providing an updated range of outcomes for our top line.\nThe midpoint of our guide reflects a continuation of the first half economic and consumer dynamics through the back half of '24. The high end of the guide implies some acceleration in industry trends coupled with increased traction of our growth initiatives. The low end of our guide reflects the recognition that the macroeconomic environment may have a greater impact on our results in the back half of '24.\nOn the bottom line, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance 40 basis points based upon our Q2 outperformance. We continue to anticipate our operating margins in the back half will be materially in line with 2023 results. With a 40-basis-point increase, we are raising our full year '24 operating margin to a range of 18.0% to 18.4%, which includes a 60-basis-point benefit from the full year impact from the Q1 out-of-period adjustment. Without the Q1 out-of-period adjustment, our full year operating margin will now be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%.\nAdditionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $45 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. As a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc, so the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis, all other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks.\nOur capital allocation plans for '24 remain unchanged. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to driving our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency.\nAs was communicated quarterly, we're committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share and have $826 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We will continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders.\nAs we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, with operating margins in the mid- to high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 reasons that remain consistent. Our ability to gain market share in a fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital-first, but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\nWith that, I'll open the call for questions."

First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, Chief Accounting Officer & Head of IR\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance. including our updated guidance for fiscal '24 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, for the first quarter of last year, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning.\nAlso, for the first quarter of this year, we will refer to our GAAP results, both with and without the benefit of an out-of-period adjustment that we recorded during the first quarter. We believe providing these disclosures is useful to understanding our quarterly financial results. Jeff will share the details of this adjustment later in his prepared remarks. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. And finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, thank you for joining the call. Before we review our Q1 results, I want to take a moment to thank all of our teams around the globe for their consistent contributions to our company. We could not continue to produce strong earnings without their cross-functional collaboration and dedication.\nWe are pleased to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2024, driven by an improving top line trend and continued strength in our profitability. In Q1, our comps came in above expectations at negative 4.9%, and we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 19.5% and earnings per share of $4.07.\nIt is important to note that the results of the first quarter include a benefit of $49 million, resulting from the reversal of freight-related accruals that we determined were not required, which contributed 290 basis points to our operating margin and $0.59 to our EPS. Jeff will walk you through this in more detail, but it is worth noting that even without the impact of this benefit, we significantly exceeded profitability expectations.\nAs a result of our outperformance, we are raising our outlook on operating margin to now be in the range of 17.6% to 18% or 17% to 17.4%, when excluding the impact of the freight accrual reversal. The strong results for the quarter are a result of our focus on our 3 key priorities in 2024. Returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving margin.\nI'll start first with returning to growth. We are pleased with the improvement in our top line trends and our market share gains in Q1. We are keenly focused on innovation in our product line across brands and our unique in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization allows us to offer this high-quality design innovation at compelling price points.\nAnother key component of our return to growth strategy is our marketing capabilities. Our in-house digital marketing optimization backed by our world-class customer analytics and our first-party data collection serves as a competitive advantage for our company. In the quarter, we increased our ad spend and invested in both our paid marketing and our proven social strategy. This investment allowed us to drive sales improvement to acquire new customers and to gain market share.\nAdditionally, we are continuing to improve our online experience through our investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology. From product discovery and selection to personalization to concept to customer care and to the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how we can improve our best-in-class e-commerce experience.\nAnd one way we do this is through AI. We believe our leadership in AI will be another competitive advantage. And it's important to not forget that as focused as we are on our digital capabilities, our service and our best-in-class retail business. We have improved our in-store experience with inspirational products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next level in-store services.\nOur teams are the best in retail. And our retail optimization efforts are transforming our fleet to be positioned in the most profitable inspiring and strategic locations.\nMoving to our second and third key priorities in 2024, which are inextricably intertwined, we continue to make progress improving our world-class customer service and driving margins. The customer is at the center of everything we do, and our satisfaction is key to our operating performance. We are pleased with our high Net Promoter Scores, both in-store and in home, but we see more opportunity to improve.\nWe know that providing our associates with new tools and training has a direct impact on our customer experience. And we are thrilled to bring back our annual store manager conference in Q2 of this year. This multi-day offsite meeting is an opportunity for all of our store managers to participate in strategic training.\nThe improvement in customer service also comes from supply chain efficiency. We are reducing costs by limiting out of market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacements. These improvements will continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2024 and beyond. And our ongoing commitment to [indiscernible] site-wide promotions and the reduction of our promotional offerings, have also improved margins. We are focused on delivering our compelling value equation to our customers, which in turn maximizes our full price selling.\nNow I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 10.8% comp in Q1. We continue to see softness in higher ticket furniture sales in Pottery Barn, but we've seen quarter-over-quarter improvement. We're having success in our proprietary print and pattern across textiles and easy decorating updates continue to drive sales. Highlights include [indiscernible] in our [indiscernible] shop, frames and decor. Our strength in seasonal celebrations also continues to resonate with our customers.\nIn March, we launched our first ever global collaboration with international icon Deepika Padukone. Her popularity drove 1 billion impressions for the Pottery Barn brand. Customers also embrace the launch of our coastal look book, and they positively engaged with our newly developed app.\nIn the back half of this year, we're excited to introduce new innovation, both in-store with compelling new forces and online with improved digital shopping experience.\nThe Pottery Barn Children's business ran a positive 2.8% comp in Q1. Across these life-stage businesses, we drove widespread comp trend improvement in the business. We've seen excellent customer response to our new product introductions with collaborations being a particular highlight. Our recent launches with partners such as LoveShackFancy and Lilly Pulitzer have driven sales and attracted new customers by tapping into relevant fashion and home decor trends.\nIn Baby, we're seeing double-digit registry growth and excellent customer response to our expanded essentials and gifting. In Dorm, we recently launched our biggest collection to date with expanded XL twin bedding options, new no nails [indiscernible] and innovative storage solutions. In addition to the expanded assortment, we are excited to roll out improved dorm product selection functionality. And customers can also ship dorm products to any one of our company-owned stores near their college campus.\nMoving to West Elm. In Q1, West Elm drove sequential improvement in its top line trend, running a negative 4.1% comp in the quarter. We're encouraged to see improvement in West Elm's demand trend, even as we materially pull back on promotions. We are seeing strength in our new product sales with our spring units driving positive comp to last year, with particularly strong performance out of furniture, kits and decorative accessories.\nSummer [indiscernible] is also off to a great start with double and triple-digit [indiscernible] comps. Given the positive trends in newness, we have a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products.\nThe Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive 0.9% comp in Q1. This is the second consecutive quarter, the Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive comp with the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business running a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. During Q1, we inspired customers with exclusive and innovative products. We benefited from new introductions of Williams-Sonoma branded products in categories like bakeware, cutlery and food. The favorable customer response to these items continues to reinforce the opportunity we have to the Williams-Sonoma branded business.\nIn March, our co-branded collaborations drove media attention and results. Our popular collaboration with Aerin Lauder was expanded to include new items for both Williams-Sonoma and Williams-Sonoma Home. We also partnered with Trisha Yearwood to make our best-selling cocktail collaboration, the official drink of our new 55,000 square foot bar and restaurant in Nashville that she built with her husband, Garth Brooks.\nNow I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business grew 10% in Q1, driving record-breaking demand in the quarter. We saw improvement in our trade business, running a positive 6% on the quarter, along with continued momentum in our contract business, which represents about 1/3 of the B2B business up 18%. We're encouraged by our diverse book of businesses ranging from sofas for [indiscernible] San Diego dorms to corporate gifting for Pebble Beach Company. We also saw continued growth for our existing large project customers such as Marriott, Dave & Buster's and Jamestown Properties.\nNow I'd like to talk about our global business. Despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures impacting our global business, we're pleased with the performance in key markets, including India, Canada and Mexico.\nIn India, we are continuing to see strong growth from increased marketing and brand awareness campaigns across the brands.\nIn Canada, our business is thriving in both the retail and direct-to-consumer channels, driven by enhanced omnichannel strategy wider product selection and the expansion of our business-to-business program across all brands in the market.\nAnd in Mexico, the market shows strength driven by a focus on the design business and expanded assortment fueled by our improved stock position. We will continue to leverage the knowledge gained from these markets to enhance the global customer experience in our new and emerging markets.\nLastly, I'd like to update you on emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered another double-digit quarter. We saw all categories drive growth and continue to see success with both consumer and trade customers. The brand remains focused on delivering high-quality products that support your home remodel and refresh projects. The strongest performance comes from bath, hardware and lighting, while we also see strength in several of our new growth categories like textiles, organization, window hardware and outdoor.\nCustomers continue to update their homes, specifically in the kitchen and bath spaces and add the finishing touches with Rejuvenation. We are excited by the momentum in this brand and the growth potential this year and beyond.\nMark and Graham, our monogram gifting business, also drove a double-digit comp growth in Q1. The brand is increasingly recognized as an inspirational lifestyle brand experiencing continued growth as a go-to destination for gifts, including graduations and weddings. Q2 has started strong with a positive reception to the brand's Mother's Day and Father's Day gift selections.\nAnd finally, GreenRow, our newest brand, continues to grow and expand its assortment of vintage-inspired colorful furnishings that are sustainably sourced and designed to last. The second catalog drop this month with a focus on print and pattern. We are seeing a very positive response to its unique offerings in the market and look forward to seeing additional assortment expansions and partnerships in the coming months. Being successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio and address white space in the market.\nIn summary, we are extremely proud of our results. During the last few years, we, as a company, have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have a strong omnichannel platform with an exclusive lifestyle offering and a sophisticated distribution network with additional capacity. We recognize that there is continued uncertainty with the environment and the consumer.\nBut because we operate in a highly fragmented market, we will continue to gain share by inspiring and servicing our customers. We remain committed to driving our 3 key priorities in 2024, one, returning to growth; two, elevating our world-class customer service; and three, driving margins.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to deliver these strong Q1 results. We've seen sequential improvement in our top line trend and we continue to exceed expectations on the bottom line. As Laura said, our results this quarter reflect 3 key we've laid out for fiscal year '24.\nFirst, returning to growth; fueled by our brand strategies, emerging brand opportunities, business-to-business expansion and global footprint. Second, elevating our world-class service; which drives both customer retention and expense savings. And finally, third, driving earnings as we continue to deliver strong profitability. These 3 themes resonate across our earnings today. And given our strong Q1 results, we're confident we can deliver long-term growth and even stronger earnings as the customer shifts back to home.\nNow let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q1 results and then provide an update on guidance for '24. Net revenues finished at $1.66 billion, in line with our expectations. Our comp of negative 4.9% sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw better performance across both furniture and nonfurniture categories even as we reduced our overall level of promotions from last year. From a cadence perspective, our trends were relatively consistent across the quarter.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at 48.3%, which includes a $49 million or 290 basis point benefit from an out-of-period adjustment. Subsequent to filing our 10-K, we identified that we over accrued freight expense across fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 by $49 million. Following the prescribed accounting rules, we determined the over accrual was not material to any prior period and not material to our projected full year '24 results. Therefore, we recorded the correction in Q1 as an out-of-period adjustment that benefited our results this quarter. Without the out-of-period adjustment, gross margin came in at 45.4%, 680 basis points higher than last year and substantially exceeding expectations. There were 3 drivers to the 680 basis point improvement.\nFirst, merchandise margins, improved 470 basis points, driven by lower ocean freight as we benefited from lapping last year's pandemic-related ocean freight runoff and our ongoing commitment to full-price selling.\nSecond, supply chain efficiencies contributed 240 basis points, driven by lower than pre-pandemic returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, [indiscernible] market shipping and [indiscernible] per order. These supply change efficiencies are yielding a notable improvement in customer service and cost savings.\nAnd third, occupancy costs, although down 3% from last year, deleveraged 30 basis points. We continue to optimize our retail fleet, while we invest in our world-class technology stack and our supply change. Wrapping up our gross margin, we delivered substantially higher gross margin this quarter, driven by better merchandise margin, supply chain efficiencies and lower occupancy costs.\nTurning now to SG&A. SG&A expense came in at 28.8% of revenues or 310 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher advertising spend, and incentive compensation. Advertising expense deleveraged 170 basis points as we continue to invest into higher levels of advertising spend to drive sales at an efficient return. Our multi-brand portfolio allows us to test the return of this incremental spend. Our own hands-on keyboard approach allows our investment to go further, keeps our learnings in-house and gives us a competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry.\nEmployment expense was 100 basis points higher year-over-year, driven entirely by higher performance-based incentive compensation. Without incentive compensation, employment was flat year-over-year on a rate basis. In Q1, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers in accordance with top line trends.\nOn the bottom line, our earnings significantly exceeded expectations. Including the benefit from the out-of-period adjustment, operating income came in at $323.8 million. Operating margin was 19.5%, and diluted earnings per share was $4.07. The out-of-period adjustment increased operating income by $49 million, operating margin by 290 basis points and earnings per share by $0.59. Without the out-of-period adjustment, our earnings still significantly exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $274.8 million, operating margin was 16.6%, 370 basis points above last year and diluted earnings per share was $3.48, up $0.84 or 32% year-over-year.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $40 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned $107 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Merchandise inventories ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, down 13% to last year. Overall, our inventories are well positioned to support our business.\nSumming up our Q1 results. We're proud to have delivered another quarter of earnings substantially exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank our talented dedicated team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for delivering these outstanding results.\nNow let's turn to our '24 outlook. Given our Q1 results, we are reiterating our revenue guidance and raising our operating margin guidance for fiscal year '24. On the top line, we continue to expect full year '24 net revenues to be in the range of down 3% to up 3% with comps between down 4.5% to up 1.5%. We anticipate sequential improvement across the year, with the first half tougher than the second half, as our top line comparisons get easier and our growth drivers accelerate.\nOn the bottom line, we are raising our guidance based upon our Q1 results, but anticipate our operating margins going forward will be relatively in line with '23 results. We are raising our operating margin guidance to a range of 17.6% to 18%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact of the out-of-period adjustment.\nWithout the out-of-period adjustment, we expect our full year operating margin will be in the range of 17% to 17.4%, a raise of 50 basis points due to our strong Q1 results. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $40 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%.\nAs a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. So the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks.\nOur capital allocation plans for '24 remain unchanged. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to drive our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency.\nWe remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. For dividends, in March, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 26% or $0.23 to $1.13 per share. Fiscal year '24 will be the 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts, which we are both proud of and remain committed to.\nFor share repurchases, we have $956 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization through which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders.\nAs we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins in the mid- to high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 reasons that remain consistent.\nOur ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\nWith that, I'll open the call for questions."

Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. .\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into our Q4 results, I'd like to acknowledge the accomplishments of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. The results we are about to share with you today reflected their collaboration, innovation and dedication, and I want to give everybody on this team a huge shout-out and a huge thank you.\nWe are pleased with our strong finish to 2023. In Q4, our comp came in above expectations at negative 6.8%, with a 2-year comp at negative 7.4% and a 4-year comp at positive 29.1%. In the quarter, we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 20.1% and earnings per share of $5.44. Turning to the full year. Our comp [ went down ] 9.9% with a 2-year comp at negative 3.4% and a 4-year comp at positive 35.6%. We delivered an annual operating margin of 16.4% with full year earnings per share of $14.85 feeding our 2023 comp guidance of negative 10% to negative 12% and hitting our operating margin range of 16% to 16.5%.\nI think it's worth putting these results in context. 4 years ago, the global pandemic changed how we worked and lived as most of us began to spend an unprecedented amount of time in our homes and interest rates were historical lows. As a result of these 2 dynamics, the demand for home furnishing surged. Our company was well positioned to meet this demand with its compelling product assortment, supply chain capabilities and the experience of our tenured management team. But the demand of the pandemic came with complications, including supply chain inefficiencies and higher vendor costs. Despite these increased costs and complexities, we stayed focused on innovating our proprietary products, running a full price business and managing ad costs and employment expenses.\nAs we came out of the record year in 2022, we started to see slowing in our sales trend as interest rates increased and home sales declined. Decreases in furniture demand continued to put pressure on our top line. But again, we stay focus on transforming our operations, cutting costs and improving supply chain inefficiencies, all which drove us to nearly double our profitability compared to pre-pandemic. Our exceptional results in 2023 were driven by strong operational execution in a challenging environment for home furnishings.\nWhile the data suggested that consumers were resilient, they shifted away from home into experiences in entertainment and they have been hesitant on furniture purchases. Nonetheless, we have continued to drive results. From prepandemic through the pandemic and to today, we have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have developed a strong omni-channel platform and have invested in a distribution network with additional capacity.\nGoing forward, we see another growth opportunity on the horizon for our company, resulting from a more normalized interest rate environment, improved home sales and our strategy. As we look to next year and beyond, we are focused on 3 key priorities: First, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and three, driving margins. Our growth will be driven by our business strategies in each of our core businesses.\nour B2B program, our emerging brands and our global business. We will continue to improve our world-class customer service by driving supply chain improvements from [ reduced ] out of market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacements. These improvements will continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2024 and beyond. And we see opportunity to drive margin by continuing our focus on full price selling and cost negotiations.\nAs it relates to other cost efficiencies, we will maintain our employment cost savings that we achieved last year following our comprehensive review of our organization structure. Regarding marketing, we continue to increase our spend, and we are seeing very effective returns on our paid marketing and on our social strategy. This investment will both drive sales and help us acquire new customers. Our in-house marketing expertise and performance-driven approach continues to serve as a differentiator between us and our peers.\nAlso, our ongoing investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology continues to improve our online experience. We are focused on offering customers inspiring content and dynamic tools to assist with design projects and AI is accelerating these efforts. We see many opportunities for our business from developments in AI, and we believe our leadership in this area will be yet another competitive advantage.\nAs focused as we are on our digital and e-commerce capabilities, we remain passionate about our best-in-class retail business. We continue to improve our in-store experiences with inspirational products and next-level design services. I truly believe our teams are the best in the industry. And our continued retail optimization efforts have transformed our fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations.\nOn the sustainability front, in Q4, we are proud to be the only home furnishings retailer included in the 2023 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. And we started 2024 by being named one of Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. Our commitment to value is embedded in our company strategy, and we are proud of our recognition as a leader in sustainable home furnishings. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 9.6% comp in Q4 and ran a negative 3.8% on a 2-year basis and positive 38.1% on a 4-year basis. The comp improved sequentially from Q3 but still ran negative due to the pullback in consumer spending and furniture.\nDuring the holiday season, we saw strength in seasonal decor, entertaining and home textiles. The brand experienced a strong customer response over the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, and we continue to reduce discounting and strengthen our merchandise margins. The brand benefited from a Q4 launch of the Pottery Barn mobile shopping and design app. This new app allows customers to shop full room designs, share their favorite products and connect with a design expert all through the convenience of their phone or tablet.\nWe anticipate the continued customer adoption of this app will drive conversion for Pottery Barn in 2024 and beyond. As we launch our exclusive spring product collections, we're seeing continued strength in fashion bedding, home furnishings and [ botanicals ]. Customers are continuing to gravitate towards easy updates with color, print and pattern. The Pottery Barn children business ran a negative 2.5% comp in Q4 and was 1.5% positive on a 2-year basis and 21.1% positive on a 4-year basis. We continue to be focused on delivering compelling innovation and evolving the customer experience, and we are pleased to see improvement in the comp. Our baby business continued to be very strong and represents a sizable opportunity. We have been delivering growth in registry with our curated assortment, easy-to-use mobile app and in-store baby experts.\nWe've also introduced new products that are both high quality and innovation, such as our Dream Deluxe Power Swivel Recliner with heat and massage. Also, we're proud of our collaborations, and we just launched Aerin Lauder, who is making her debut line for baby with whimsical design and [ keepsake ] quality. Also in Q4, we saw a strong consumer response to our expanded seasonal offerings that range from baby's first Christmas to Grinch-themed betting for teens. We saw customers return to us for Valentine's Day and Easter with a strong response to our new collaborations, including an expanded collection of Hello Kitty. We're also seeing a particularly strong trend with our [ NFL ] offering in teens. And finally, we're seeing strength in nursery furniture, a purchase that is less dependent on new home sales.\nMoving to West Elm. West Elm is the brand that has been the most impacted by the consumer pullback in furniture. In Q4, West Elm ran a negative 15.3% and was negative 26% on a 2-year basis and positive 17.5% on a 4-year basis. However, what I'm excited about are our new product sales from this year's holiday assortment, which has strong growth to last year across all categories. The customer responded positively to fresh designs in furniture, textiles and decorative accessories. We also saw strong sales in holiday decor. And as we move into 2024, [ newness ] continues to accelerate and is performing well. Given these positive trends in newness, we continue to see a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive 1.6% comp in Q4. On a 2-year basis, the brand was negative 0.9% and was positive 29.8% on a full year basis. In Q4, the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business ran a positive comp for the third consecutive quarter, and our Williams-Sonoma home business meaningfully improved.\nRetail has been very strong, with inspiring in-store events and dramatically improved in stocks. Our seasonal categories grew double digits and we saw strength in core businesses like cookware and bakeware, as customers gravitated towards gifting and entertaining at home. Throughout the quarter, collaborations like our Cookware partnership with GreenPan and Stanley Tucci and the launch of a partnership with one of Netflix most watched shows, Bridgerton, continue to drive sales, buzz and new customer acquisition.\nNow I would like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business ended the year strong with Q4 at positive 5%, bringing the total year to a positive 1%, coming in just under $1 billion. The contract business exceeded expectations at positive 31% on the year, fueled by continued strength in the hospitality and residential sectors along with early traction in developing segments such as health care, gaming and senior living. Flagship projects in the back half of the year range from providing furnishings from medical office providers across the country as well as entertainment venues like Dave & Buster's.\nOur B2B team also provided guest room furniture for the new Fontainebleau hotel that recently opened in Vegas. Now I'd like to talk about our global business. While macroeconomic pressures continue to affect our global business, we are pleased with our performance in India, Mexico and Canada. In India, we are seeing growth from strong marketing and brand awareness campaigns across the brands with a high penetration of our Design Crew business. In Mexico, the market continues to show strength driven by improved in-stocks and a strong holiday season. The Canada business continues to build momentum, fueled by our commitment to enhance the customer experience, both online and in retail.\nOur digital initiatives in the Canadian market continue to gain new customers and drive results for our brands. And we are pleased with the initial positive response to the recent launches of Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham and Williams-Sonoma Home in Canada. As we continue to expand our omnichannel presence around the globe, India, Mexico and Canada remain our key strategic growth markets. Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered a strong quarter with a double-digit positive comp driven by success in our remodel product categories and new growth initiatives.\nWe continue to see strength in both consumer and B2B sales. Rejuvenation continues to establish itself as a destination for home projects by providing products with great function, high-quality and timeless design details. We're excited about the momentum in the brand and the growth potential in 2024 and beyond and believe Rejuvenation can be our next billion-dollar brand. Mark and Graham, our high-quality gifting business saw strong growth this year with a single -- high single-digit positive comp in the quarter.\nOur monogramming capabilities, coupled with unique high-quality gifts and the brand's curated online gift shops make it easy for customers to find a perfect gift and finally, our startup GreenRow. We continue to gain momentum in this new brand, which utilizes sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful heirloom quality products. We remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and it's aesthetic. In 2024, we are planning to grow GreenRow with substantial increases in product assortment.\nThese successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio and address white space in the market. In summary, we're extremely proud of our accomplishments and financial results this year. We outperformed in 2023 despite the slowest housing market in several decades and massive geopolitical unrest. Although this pressured our top line trend, we stayed focused on full price selling, supply chain efficiencies and best-in-class customer service. We have transformed our business model, and as a result, we delivered an operating margin well above our guidance and well ahead for pre-pandemic operating margin.\nWe have a powerful portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and [ life stages ], and we have built a strong omnichannel platform and infrastructure, which positions us well for the next stage of growth. It is early, but our reads on Q1 is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities that exist ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to fiscal year '23 with Q4 and full year '23 earnings significantly exceeding expectations. We delivered these earnings despite a challenging backdrop for home furnishings, pressuring our top line. Our strong profitability in this environment demonstrates the durability of our operating margin. Our results once again reinforced the theme we consistently communicated in 2023.\nFirst, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions. Second, our first half supply chain cost pressures became tailwinds in the second half. And third, our discipline to control costs and manage inventory levels. Given the strength of our earnings through this challenging period for home furnishings, we're confident we can deliver long-term growth and even stronger earnings as the customer shifts back to home. Now let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q4 results, followed by our full fiscal year '23 results, then provide guidance for '24. Q4 net revenues finished at $2.28 billion. Our revenues came in at the high end of our expectations, driven by strong holiday performance across our portfolio of brands, partially offset by ongoing customer hesitancy towards big ticket expenditures.\nDuring the quarter, we continued our commitment to maintain price integrity and we reduced our overall level of promotions. Our Q4 comps came in at negative 6.8%, with our 2-year comp at negative 7.4% and our full year comp to 2019 at plus 29.1%. From a cadence perspective, our comps reflect a strong Black Friday to Christmas holiday period, [ bookended ] by inconsistent and choppy sales on both ends. Moving down the income statement. Q4 gross margin improved 480 basis points over last year to 46% as higher selling margins more than offset the impact of higher occupancy costs. Q4 selling margin at 55.1% were 560 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the full impact to our profitability of the supply chain tailwinds we've been guiding for several quarters.\nOur higher Q4 selling margins were driven by both higher merchandise margins, and lower costs from supply chain efficiencies. Q4 merchandise margins contributed about half the increase in selling margins, driven by lower input costs, and our focus on full price selling. The balance sheet improvement came directly from supply chain efficiencies, which drove an improved customer experience and lower costs. We're proud to see our focus on execution and investment in supply chain paying off. Key metrics, including out-of-market shipping, multiple deliveries per order, returns, accommodations, damages and replacements are all performing at pre-pandemic levels, if not better.\nOur higher Q4 selling margins more than offset the 2% growth in Q4 occupancy costs to $208 million or 9.1% of net revenues, up 80 basis points from last year. Turning now to SG&A. Our Q4 SG&A expense of $591 million, grew 13% and [ ran ] at 25.9% of revenues, deleveraging 460 basis points. As a reminder, our Q4 '22 SG&A results benefited from favorable items that we guided would not repeat in Q4 '23. Excluding the favorable items from last year, our SG&A dollars decreased 4%. Q4 employment was 300 basis points higher year-over-year, driven by higher performance-based incentive compensation in fiscal year '23 than last year.\nIn Q4, we continued to manage variable employment costs in accordance with top line trends. Q4 advertising expense was 60 basis points higher year-over-year as we took advantage of opportunities to invest into higher levels of advertising spend. As Laura mentioned, we continue to increase our spend as we are seeing very effective returns on this investment. Our ability to invest in these opportunities is an example of the competitive advantage of our agile, performance-driven marketing organization. our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform continue to drive efficient advertising spend.\nQ4 general expenses drove the balance of the increase as we lapped a favorable insurance settlement received in fiscal year '22. On the bottom line, our Q4 earnings significantly exceeded expectations. Q4 operating income came in at $458 million and operating margin at 20.1%, 20 basis points above last year, with Q4 diluted earnings per share of $5.44. Turning now to our full year results, which again exceeded expectations. Full year net revenues finished at $7.75 billion. Our full year revenues reflect a larger home furnishings backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity even if it meant for growing some revenues in the short term.\nOur full year comp ran down 9.9% with our 2-year comp at negative 3.4%, and our 4-year comp to 2019 at plus 35.6%. Full year gross margin ended at 42.7%, a 30 basis point improvement over last year as our first half supply chain headwinds turned into even stronger tailwinds in the back half. Full year selling margins at 53.2% were 170 basis points over last year and our highest ever selling margin rate driven by a nearly equal mix of higher merchandise margins and supply chain efficiency, these higher selling margins more than offset the 4% increase in our full year occupancy costs to $814 million. Full year SG&A expense decreased 5.8% to $2.04 billion. This decrease was driven by employment reductions taken in Q1 and Q2, and our management of variable employment in line with top line trends and a 20 basis point reduction in advertising on the full year.\nFull year SG&A deleverage of 140 basis points was primarily driven by lapping the favorable items recognized in Q4 '22 that I discussed earlier. On the bottom line, full year operating income finished at $1.27 billion, and operating margin at 16.4%, significantly above our pre-COVID levels and the 15% operating margin floor we established at the start of the year. Full year diluted earnings per share ended at $14.85. On the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.26 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $188 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned over $545 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Year-end merchandise inventories stood at $1.25 billion, down 14.4% to last year. At these levels, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively managed our inventory levels in line with our top line trends.\nWe generated a record level of free cash flow in 2023 at $1.49 billion, driven by the strength of our earnings, proactive inventory management and financial discipline. Speaking of financial discipline, a prime example is our fiscal year '23 return on invested capital of 45%. This is among the best in the retail industry. Summing up our '23 results, we're proud to have delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. As Laura said, these results reflect the efforts of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma Inc. And I'd like to thank our talented team for delivering these outstanding results in a challenging environment.\nNow let's turn to our '24 outlook. First, let me point out that 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma Inc. So the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We anticipate 2024 will be a year of continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Lower interest rates could spur the housing market and shift consumer spending back to home, but timing is hard to predict.\nAnd there is also the election and global geopolitical tension. With this in mind, we are providing a wide range of guidance for '24. '24 net revenues are expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 3% with comps between down 4.5% to up 1.5% and operating margins between 16.5% and 16.8%. On the top line, we anticipate sequential improvement across the year. With the first half tougher than the second half, as our top line comparisons get easier. On the bottom line, we expect our supply chain tailwinds will continue through at least the first half of '24, but will be partially offset by higher advertising spend. In the back half, we anticipate our operating margins will be in line with '23 results.\nOur capital allocation plans for '24 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in long-term growth. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to drive our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. We expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. For dividends, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 26% or $0.23 to $1.13 per share. Fiscal year '24 will be the 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts, which we are both proud of and remain committed to.\nFor share repurchases, today, we also announced our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing previous authorizations and under which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders. Combined, our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization continue our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.\nIn fact, we've returned over $3.8 billion to our shareholders over the last 6 years. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term top line guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. And in the long term, we now believe we can sustain operating margins in the mid [indiscernible] peers and deliver shareholder growth for these reasons. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions."

Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, Chief Accounting Officer & Head of IR\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'm here this morning with Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; Yasir Anwar, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer; and Felix Carbullido, our President of the Williams-Sonoma brand.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, included updated guidance for fiscal '23 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we can't make any assurances these statements will materialize and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. Finally, a replay of this call is available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into our Q3 results, I would like to take a minute to thank the incredible team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for another quarter of great results. Without their hard work, dedication and focus, none of the results we are reporting today would have been achievable.\nWe are on the road to deliver another quarter of strong earnings, significantly exceeding expectations despite a challenging economic backdrop for our industry. We beat profitability estimates with a record third quarter operating margin of 17%, with earnings per share of $3.66. Our comp sales, which reflect the larger macroeconomic backdrop, ran negative 14.6% in Q3, and our 2-year comp was negative 6.5% and our 4-year comp to 2019 was positive 34.8%. These results were achieved in an environment both with ongoing consumer hesitancy on high-ticket discretionary furniture and elevated levels of promotional activity.\nDespite this, we continue to drive results because of our unique proposition in the marketplace and our relentless focus on customer service. Our advantage is our portfolio of brands serving a wide range of categories, aesthetics and life stages. While people are currently buying fewer large-ticket furniture pieces than last year, our portfolio of brands and product offerings has us positioned well for this shift into kitchen purchases, fashion textiles, dorm, baby and seasonal holiday offerings.\nOur in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated supply chain are also key in producing proprietary products at the best quality value relationship in the market. We remain firmly committed to reducing promotions despite elevated levels of discounting in the industry. In fact, our third quarter promotional levels were meaningfully lower than last year.\nInstead, we are meeting our customers' needs for value by introducing a larger offering of new products at mid-tier and lower price points. Not only is this strategy good for profits, but we have also reduced friction with our customers as we give them better value without confusing them with short-term discounts. We strongly believe that this is the right way to run our business as it preserves the design value price equation that we offer and our customers appreciate.\nMoving on to customer service and the supply chain. We are seeing the year-over-year benefit of selling through inventories with lower supply chain costs. And we continue to increase selling margins by reducing out-of-market multiple shipments. We have improved our customer service, returning to pre-pandemic and best-in-class levels. Investments in the final mile delivery experience have resulted in fewer customer accommodations, lower returns, lower damages and lower replacements, and customer metrics like on-time delivery are at record highs and backorder create rates have substantially improved.\nThe total benefit from these supply chain and customer service improvements is significant, and you can see it in our results today. Regarding marketing, we increased our spend from Q2 but still leveraged in the quarter. We continue to ensure that our marketing investment gives us the ability to test new plants, to connect with new customers and to showcase our offering to our existing customer base and our highly engaged brand loyalists. We've seen increasing success with our marketing and product collaborations, and we will continue to build upon them.\nOur ongoing investment in building our proprietary e-commerce technology continues to improve our online experience. We're focused on offering customers inspiring content and dynamic tools to assist with their design projects, and AI is accelerating these efforts. We see many opportunities for our business from developments from AI. And as early adapters of integrating AI, we look forward to leading the retail industry in the area, and we will focus on quality, authenticity and responsiveness of this new technology.\nAnd as focused as we are on our e-commerce capabilities, we are also continuing to focus on delivering a best-in-class retail business. Our stores are beautifully designed and curated with inspirational assortment, and our continued retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations.\nOn the sustainability front, we are proud to report that in Q3, we were named a top scorer on the Sustainable Furnishings Council Wood Furniture Scorecard for the sixth consecutive year. Using sustainable wood has been a key focus of our strategy and a differentiator of our business.\nNow I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 16.6% comp in Q3, but ran a positive 3% on a 2-year basis and a positive 43% on a 4-year basis. We have substantially reduced the promotional offerings in the brand and have success due to new low- and mid-tier programs at great value. Our demand has been most impacted. We are seeing strength in textile and seasonal decorating. We're excited for the holiday season given strong early reads on our innovative proprietary collections.\nEarlier this week, we announced the launch of a new mobile shopping and design app for Pottery Barn following the success of our Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen app. The Pottery Barn mobile app delivers a convenient customer shopping experience and makes it easy to create and manage a registry on the go. Now customers can explore and shop full groups, easily share their favorite products and connect with the design experts, all through the convenience of their phone or tablet.\nThe Pottery Barn children's business ran a negative 6.9% comp in Q3 and was negative 11.7% on a 2-year basis and positive 29% on a 4-year basis. Across these life-stage brands, we are focused on delivering compelling innovation and elevating the customer experience. One key area of focus in the quarter has been the evolution of our back-to-school offering. Here, we saw standout growth in our dorm business as customers gravitated to higher design and quality. We offer a compelling, complete solution that is easy to shop on our Pottery Barn Teen app. And given the size of the dorm market, we believe this represents a significant opportunity for us for years to come.\nWe also continue to focus on another key life stage offering, which is baby, the entry point to the children's home furnishings brand. Here, we are winning with our innovative nursery seating and a curated selection of high-quality baby gear. In our stores and across our mobile app, customers can register with Powder Barn Kids and receive help from our nursery experts. Also, we're really encouraged by the strength of our innovative product introductions and fresh product collaborations with strong response to recent Super Mario and LoveShackFancy launches. And as we look to the quarter ahead, we believe we have a compelling pipeline of collaborations that our customer will love.\nMoving on to West Elm. West Elm is the brand that has been most impacted by the customer pullback in furniture. In Q3, West Elm was negative 22.4% and was negative 18.2% on a 2-year basis and ran a positive 26.1% on a 4-year basis. West Elm has the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture, the most underdeveloped other categories and a customer base that's the most impacted by the current macro environment. Despite current challenging dynamics, West Elm saw very strong reception to their new fall products which marked a real evolution in the brand's modern design voice.\nSales from this year's fall assortment are up to last year with positive customer response to fresh, furniture forms, mixed materials and new textures and innovations in textile. Early holiday reads have also been positive in seasonal trim and tabletop, as well as hosting and entertaining categories. Given these sort of reads we see sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more into textiles, decorative accessories, entertainment and seasonal offerings. We continue to be very optimistic on the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm with its industry-leading design and value.\nThe Williams Sonoma brand, which includes Williams Sonoma Home, ran a negative 1.9% comp in Q3. On a 2-year basis, the brand ran negative 3.4% and was positive 34.6% on a 4-year basis. The Williams Sonoma Kitchen business ran a positive comp for the second consecutive quarter this year, primarily driven by retail. Earlier this quarter, we launched a successful line in cookware with Stanley Tucci, who designed an exclusive collection with Green Pan for Williams-Sonoma. Collaborations like Tuchi's have been an excellent vehicle for growth and new customer acquisition.\nKitchen continues to see strength in high-end electrics, particularly in coffee and espresso. And the Williamson Sonoma Home business, while still negative, is beginning to see improvement with a refreshed more editorial point of view that showcases updated textiles and decorative accessories. Looking to Q4, Williams Sonoma becomes a bigger part of our business, and early reads on holiday are positive indicating a strong season of entertaining and gifting ahead, this pipeline of new with engaging content and corresponding events for our customers to experience both in-store and online.\nNow I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. We are pleased to report Business-to-Business delivered a positive quarter, running positive 1.5% in Q3 driven by 30% growth in the contract business. Exciting wins in the quarter included a brand standard program for Pottery Barn with Pendry Hotels for customized outdoor furniture and a new partnership with a premier developer partner, Jamestown, for 2 new properties, including a senior living tower and a new residential development.\nWe're also excited by the success of specific B2B product developments like the expansion of our restaurant furniture program that has been key to gaining momentum in the food and beverage space with clients like Dave & Buster's, along with clients in the sports and entertainment. The future remains bright for this business.\nNow I'd like to talk about our global business. Our global strategy has not changed, and we continue to focus on our Franchise First model. This business has, of course, was affected by the uncertain macro environment, particularly in the Middle East. We are excited to see our brand feed expectations in other markets like India. We opened our third West Elm retail location in Pune and expanded our Pottery Barn brands into the world famous Geo World Plaza now open in Mumbai.\nThe Mexico market is also showing strength driven by improved in-stocks in furniture and strong back-to-school and seasonal assortments. And we continue to see momentum in our Canada business, fueled by our commitment to enhancing the customer experience both online and in retail. We have also grown the brand and service offerings available to Canadian customers by launching Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham Online, and relaunching Gift Registry in Canada.\nLastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered a positive quarter, driven by our remodel and refresh categories as well as new growth initiatives. Customers continue to update their homes, specifically in the spaces of kitchen and bath. We are continuing to grow the brand in new markets by opening a new store in the San Diego market and another new store opening this weekend in North Carolina. We continue to be excited by the opportunity we have for growth from the Rejuvenation brand.\nWe are also pleased with our results in Mark and Graham, our gifting and personalization brand. We are optimistic for Q4 as we head into the key gift-giving holiday season. Customers will benefit from the brand's inspiring content and curated monogram gift guides organized by both recipients and price point. And at GreenRow, we continue to gain momentum in this new brand, which utilizes sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful air and quality products. While it's early, we remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and its aesthetic.\nThese successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio of brands and address white space in our product offerings, all with minimal investment and low cost of entry, leveraging our knowledge and infrastructure.\nIn summary, our outperformance this quarter drove a record Q3 operating margin of 17%. Although customers are shifting their spending temporarily away from high-ticket furniture purchases, we have a powerful portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages to meet the demands of customers. And despite our sales running down this year, our execution and the strength of our operating model produced strong earnings again this quarter, driven by our full-price selling, supply chain efficiencies and best-in-class customer service.\nOur early seasonal reads are strong, and we are optimistic about the holiday season. As we put this all together, we are raising our guidance for the year. We now expect full year revenues to come in at a range of down 10% to down 12%, and we are raising our outlook on operating margin to a range of 16% to 16.5%. It is important to note that the reduction in our revenues outlook is more than offset by our raised operating margin outlook.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers in detail.\n\nBrian William Nagel\n\nMD & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that, once again, we've delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. Our Q3 results reinforce the themes we've consistently communicated over the past several quarters. First, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions. Second, how our earlier supply chain cost pressures will become tailwinds in the second half and beyond. And third, our ability to control costs and manage inventory levels. Our strong profitability this quarter, despite softer top line revenues, demonstrates the durability of our operating margin.\nNow let's dive into our Q3 results, followed by an update on our fiscal year guidance. In addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with pre-pandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.854 billion, while below our expectations, our revenues reflect the larger home furnishing backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity, even if it means forgoing some revenues in the short term. Our revenue growth in Q3 came in at negative 14.6% comp. Our 2-year stack was negative 6.5% and our 4-year stack against 2019 and grew 34.8%.\nOur Q3 demand comp at negative 11.8% was materially unchanged from our Q2 trend. Our 2-year demand stack was negative 13.8%, and our 4-year demand stack was a positive 33.2%. Our revenue comps this quarter reflect a normalized spread between demand and net comps. Our improvement across returns and appeasements offsets the majority of last year's outsized back order fill. From a cadence perspective, our demand trends continue to be inconsistent and choppy, especially after Labor Day.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin at 44.4% exceeded our expectations. The 290 basis point improvement over last year reflects the supply chain tailwinds we've been guiding for several quarters. Merchandise margins increased materially over last year, driven by lower ocean freight costs flowing into our income statement and our focus on full price selling and price integrity. In fact, merchandise margins were substantially higher than Q3 2019.\nSelling margin also improved materially over last year, driven by supply chain efficiency. Through our improved execution and investment in supply chain, we substantially improved our customer experience. Key metrics, including out-of-market shipping, multiple deliveries per order returns, accommodations, damages and replacements are all performing at pre-pandemic levels, if not better. I'd like to congratulate and thank our entire organization for delivering these results. Altogether, our selling margins were 450 basis points higher than last year. reflecting the full impact to our profitability of the supply chain tailwinds.\nOccupancy costs of $200 million were 1% lower than last year and decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter. Coming in at 10.8% of net revenues, occupancy deleveraged 160 basis points to last year driven by the softer top line. Our Q3 gross margin at 44.4% is 840 basis points higher than 2019's 36%. Our SG&A expenses of $507 million were down 11% to last year, once again reflecting our ability to control costs. Our 27.4% rate deleveraged 140 basis points to last year, driven by general expenses offsetting variable expense savings.\nEmployment expense decreased double digits versus last year, but deleveraged primarily driven by favorability in last year's stock-based compensation. We continue to manage variable employment costs in accordance with top line trends. Our advertising expense slightly leveraged in Q3 despite increased funding quarter-over-quarter as we continue to test into higher levels of advertising spend.\nOur rate leverage reflects the competitive advantage of our agile performance-driven marketing organization. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform continue to drive efficient advertising spend. General expenses drove the majority of the deleverage on the quarter, resulting from timing of asset disposals and legal settlements. Overall, our year-to-date SG&A through 39 weeks is down 12% to last year and flat on a rate basis. And it's 100 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.4%.\nRegarding the bottom line, our results speak for themselves. Q3 operating income came in at $315 million and operating margin at 17%, a record operating margin for our third quarter. 17% is 150 basis points above last year and 940 basis points above 2019's 7.6%. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.66 was slightly below last year's third quarter earnings per share of $3.72, but significantly above 2019 earnings per share of $1.02.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $699 million with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $42 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned over $61 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nMerchandise inventories at $1.4 billion were down 17.2% to last year. Three important points I'd like to emphasize once again. First, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively manage our inventory levels in line with our demand trends. Second, going into the holiday season, our in-stock levels are near historical highs, and our regional inventory balance and composition is well positioned. Third, our Q3 ending inventory levels are up only 11% versus same period in 2019. And that's with revenue comps of 34.8% over the same time frame. This discipline highlights how we've improved both our inventory efficiency and turnover.\nSumming up our Q3 results, we're proud to have delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank all our associates for delivering these outstanding results.\nNow let's turn to our outlook. Based on our Q3 results, we are updating our full year outlook. Our new guidance reflects both the ongoing top line uncertainty and the strength in our operating margin. We now expect full year '23 net revenues to be in a range of down 10% comp to down 12% comp, and we are raising our operating margin outlook to a range of 16% to 16.5%. It's important to note that our lower sales outlook is more than offset by our increased operating margin, producing higher implied EPS guidance.\nOn the top line, our updated guidance is based upon the facts and trends we know today from our Q3 results. Specifically, a conservative view of our 1-, 2- and 4-year trends in Q3 connects with the implicit Q4 guide and our updated full year '23 net revenue guidance. Given the macroeconomic environment, we believe this outlook is prudent.\nOn the bottom line, our supply chain tailwinds will continue to bolster our profitability, producing full year operating margin within our updated range of 16% to 16.5%, with implied Q4 operating margins in line with historical builds in Q3. We continue to expect our full year income tax rate to be approximately 26%. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now anticipated to be $225 million due to timing of project spend. As we have communicated quarterly, we are committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, and we have almost $700 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization to repurchase our stock opportunistically.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we will balance the macroeconomic uncertainty with our long-term growth potential, and we'll provide guidance in March. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit top line growth, with operating margins exceeding 15%.\nWe're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these reasons: our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\nWith that, I'll open the call for questions."

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, Chief Accounting Officer & Head of IR\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '23 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to thank the incredible team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Without their outstanding work, creativity and relentless focus, none of the results we are reporting today would be possible. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of strong earnings. We significantly exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 14.6% with earnings per share of $3.12, well above our pre-pandemic results. Our sales ran negative 11.9% in Q2 but our 2-year comp was essentially flat, and our 4-year comp to 2019 was positive 39.7%.\nWe achieved these results against an increasingly promotional environment and softening industry metrics by leveraging our market advantages and focusing on regular price selling, driving improved customer service and controlling costs. We're in a period where consumers are buying fewer large-ticket furniture pieces than they did a year ago as they shift their spending. However, our advantage is our portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages. Only approximately half of our business is furniture, and we are seeing relative strength in kitchen purchases, fashion sales, dorm, baby and seasonal holidays. And our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization allows us to design and develop quality products at a great value.\nBut we are not only innovators, we are also operators. Core to our business model is a digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy that supports our world-class shopping experience. We are pleased that due to our focus and investments in operations, we have made meaningful progress on our customer service. We've seen improvements in our key metrics, including on-time delivery and damages, both of which improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs.\nOn the digital front, we continue to control ad costs tightly, optimizing spend with a focus on the most productive channels, leaving some flexibility to test into formats that tap into new audiences. And as one of the largest e-commerce players, we continue to enhance our proprietary e-commerce tech stack. We believe we will lead the way in retail, and our use of AI and our tech capabilities, including our homegrown recommendations engine used for enabling relevant product selection on our website and our AI-powered room design tool with intelligent design guidance.\nWe also operate a best-in-class retail business with our stores not only serving as billboards for our brands but driving profit and customer service. I truly believe we have the best team in retail. And our stores are beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments, and our continued retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. Additionally, we continue to enhance our omni initiatives to better serve our customers and drive profitability. We also tightly managed all the other expenses, including employment costs. In both Q1 and Q2, we made tough decisions to rightsize our organization to control costs and drive efficiency. And we closely managed our inventory levels to align with our demand trends while improving our in-stocks. Total inventory was down 15.7% versus last year.\nNow I'd like to tell you about our progress and our sustainability efforts. In Q2, we released our 2022 Impact Report, highlighting our commitment to our values and our progress toward achieving our science-based targets and other sustainability goals. Notable in our report, we significantly scaled renewable energy. And in our value chain, we launched a vendor engagement and preferred material strategy to reduce emissions. We also detailed progress in our worker well-being goals. Our commitment to fair trade premiums, NEST-certified ethically handcrafted products and other programs that impact the lives of almost 100,000 individuals globally. We are committed to action and continuous improvement, and we are making meaningful progress on the path we've laid out. Also, we launched a new home furnishings brand, GreenRow, which I'll discuss later, which uses sustainable materials and manufacturing processes and targets an emerging demographic that prioritizes sustainability in the brands they support.\nNow I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 10.6% comp in Q2 but a 10.9% positive on a 2-year and a 48.7% positive on a 4-year basis. Although furniture demand has decelerated, we are seeing relative strength and easy updates in decorating, frames, pillows, throws and table linens. In late July, we launched our new and seasonal fall assortments, and we're getting a strong response to our proprietary textiles, including duvets, quilts, fellows and rugs. Halloween decorating is off to a strong start, which is a good indicator for the upcoming holiday season. In furniture, we're seeing strength in our new lighter finishes, velvets and cozy fabrications. And while it is early, the new fall assortment is up versus new fall last year.\nAlso in Q2, we successfully opened our newly relocated store on Post Road in Westport, Connecticut with much success. Repositioned stores like this are proving to be very productive as they bring to life our broader product assortments and showcase our free design services. Westport is an example of the effectiveness of our company-wide retail optimization strategy, which includes closing smaller and older stores and repositioning it to larger stores in open-air lifestyle centers and destination street locations.\nThe Pottery Barn Children's business ran a negative 9% comp in Q2 and was negative 3.8% on a 2-year basis and positive 19.1% on a 4-year basis. Across these life-stage brands, we are focused on delivering compelling innovation and elevating the customer experience. One key area in the quarter has been our back-to-school offering. We're proud to expand our market-leading gear to include an accessible option and to build upon our best-selling desks with accessible study solutions. Another highlight is our dorm assortment, which addresses the distinct needs of college-bound students with XL twin bedding, no decor and storage. The dorm opportunity is significant, given the underserved market, and we expect to continue to pick up market share and drive year-over-year double-digit growth in this category. Customers can shop online and ship product to any of our company stores that are closest to their college campus.\nIncluded in our dorm offer, we are excited to showcase our partnership with LoveShackFancy, which has gained even more traction with the dorm launch. We also continue to focus on baby, the entry point to our Pottery Barn Kids brand. Here, we are winning with our GREENGUARD gold nurse, our curated selection of baby gear and the expansion of furniture and gifts in our stores.\nNow let's talk about West Elm. West Elm is a brand that has been most impacted by the customer pullback in furniture. In Q2, West Elm ran a negative 20.8% and was negative 14.7% on a 2-year basis but ran a 43.4% positive on a 4-year basis. West Elm is our brand with the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture, the most underdeveloped in other categories and a customer base that has been most impacted by the environment. Despite current challenging dynamics, the brand made progress on 2 key areas that we believe will drive improvement in their business in the near term: first, newness. We are doubling our newness penetration in the back half, fueled by our fall and holiday launches. We are encouraged by the strong performance of the new fall product launch so far, which marks a real evolution in the brand's modern design voice. And while it is a small assortment, it is exceeding the performance of last year's fall newness.\nAnd second, given the success of recent collaborations with Collin King Studio and Road and the response to fall product, we see sizable opportunity in West Elm as it expands into textiles, decorative accessories, entertainment and seasonal offerings. These 2 key focus areas underpin the opportunity to improve customer count and omnichannel performance in the brand. And we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm with its industry-leading design and value.\nThe Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 0.7% comp in Q2. On a 2-year basis, the brand was essentially flat and positive 35.7% on a 4-year basis. The quarter was driven by our kitchen business, which ran positive comps offset by the home business. Throughout Q2, high-end electrics, particularly in coffee and espresso continued to lead the way in growth with successful new product launches. Customers also responded well to categories like storage and organization with our exclusive Hold Everything collection. And for the balance of the year, we have a strong pipeline of exciting exclusive product launches and strong collaboration. And based on early reads on Halloween and we expect the holiday entertaining and dining at home businesses will drive strong results for the brand.\nNow I'd like to update you on our other key initiatives. Business-to-Business ran down 5% in Q2. We continue to see strength in our contract business, which ran positive 23% in the quarter, sequentially improving from Q1. We won several proposals across industry segments, including with Sony in the entertainment space, the San Antonio Spurs Training Facility and multiple properties with the Montage, the Four Seasons, Weston, Hilton and Hyatt. The trade business has been more impacted by the slowed housing market. However, we see recent improvement in our trends, and we remain confident on this piece of the B2B business long term.\nNow I'd like to talk about our global business. A standout performer this quarter is our Canadian business. We continue to see strength from our recently replatformed e-commerce website, and we are excited with the launch of our wedding registry service in August in Canada. The Mexico market continues to show strength due to strong execution of design services and an improved in-stock position. India also remains a key growth market in our global business with strong year-over-year performance and the opening of 3 new stores next month, including the first Pottery Barn Kids store.\nLastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. At Rejuvenation, we continue to see success from the replatforming of the website with improved sales, conversion and customer experience. The brand is seeing outperformance in its home project category and strength in newly entered growth categories. At Mark and Graham, our high-quality gift and personalization brand, the business drove a high single-digit comp in Q2. And at GreenRow, we are pleased with the initial reaction to the new brands and the assortment. And while it's early and the volume is small, we are ahead of plan and remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and its aesthetics. These successful and exciting emerging brands are a testament to our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio of brands and address white space in our product offerings, all with minimal investment, low cost of entry and leveraging our knowledge and infrastructure.\nIn summary, we recognize there's been a pullback in spending on high-ticket discretionary goods with relative strength in certain other categories. Despite this top line pressure, the proven strength of our operating model produced strong earnings this quarter, driven by our focus on service, cost control and regular price selling. As we put this all together, we have changed our outlook for the year. We now expect full year revenues to come in at a range of down 5% to down 10%, and we are raising our outlook on operating margin to a range of 15% to 16%. It is important to note that the reduction in our revenues outlook is offset by our raised operating margin outlook. On balance, we believe that running our business with tighter inventory, stronger merchandising and design curation with fewer promotions will continue to drive customer satisfaction and long-term growth. Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Jeff Howie.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that once again, we've delivered a strong quarter of earnings. Our Q2 results reflect the themes we've been communicating over the past several quarters: first, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions, even if it means forgoing some revenues in the short term; second, our first half supply chain cost headwinds that will become second half tailwinds; third, our ability to control SG&A costs and manage inventory levels; and finally, how we've structurally changed our operating model, driven by our higher e-commerce mix and our retail optimization strategy. Our earnings this quarter exceeded expectations despite softer top line revenues. This illustrates the profitability of our platform and supports our long-term 15% operating margin floor.\nNow let's dive into our Q2 results, followed by an update on our fiscal year guidance. As I did last quarter, in addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with pre-pandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.863 billion. While below our expectations, our revenues reflect the larger home furnishings backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity as the industry became more promotional. Our revenue growth in Q2 came in at negative 11.9% comp.\nOur 2-year stack was essentially flat, and our 4-year stack against 2019 grew 39.7%. Our Q2 demand at negative 11.4% was materially in line with our revenue comps, reflecting a normalized spread between demand and net comps that I mentioned last quarter. On a 2-year stack, our demand was negative 8.1%, and on a 4-year stack, our demand was a positive 37.4%. From a cadence perspective, our demand trends continued to be inconsistent and choppy and decelerated from Q1, driven by a pullback in consumer spending on high-ticket discretionary.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin at 40.7% was in line with our expectations. While 280 basis points below last year, our gross margin sequentially improved over Q1 by 210 basis points. Merchandise margins decreased year-over-year as the residual amount of the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demurrage sitting on our balance sheet flowed into our income statement. Excluding these atypical capitalized costs, our merchandise margins were in line with last year. Selling margin also continued to be impacted by higher outbound customer shipping costs although to a lesser extent than prior quarters. We incurred these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-to-market distribution centers and, in some cases, intentionally shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.\nWhile we still have room to elevate our customer experience, we made substantial progress in Q2 with our customer service. I'd like to congratulate and thank our supply chain organization for elevating our service experience. Altogether, our selling margins were 90 basis points lower than last year, driven by these short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies we've been discussing in the past several quarters. As these costs are now fully amortized, Q2 will be the last quarter we report on these headwinds. In fact, we anticipate they will become tailwinds over the next few quarters.\nOccupancy costs at 10.9% of net revenues were 190 basis points above last year. Occupancy dollars at $203 million grew 5.3% over last year and were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Our 200 basis points leverage versus 2019's 12.9% occupancy rate demonstrates the impact our higher e-commerce mix and our retail optimization strategy have had on our gross margin despite Q2 '23 softer top line results. Our Q2 gross margin at 40.7% remained 530 basis points higher than 2019's 35.4%. And that includes absorbing the residual 90 basis points in supply chain-related costs and inefficiencies.\nOur SG&A rate once again reflects our ability to control costs in a challenging environment with Q2 coming in at 26.1%, leveraging 30 basis points to last year. We leveraged both employment and ad costs in the quarter. Employment leverage as we manage variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends. We also benefited from a reduction in force actions in Q1 and Q2 as we continue to look for opportunities to improve efficiency, remove redundancy and streamline operations. Our advertising leverage reflects the competitive advantage of our agile, performance-driven marketing organization. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform allow us to drive efficient advertising spend as we see business trends evolve. Overall, SG&A came in 240 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.5%. Once again, these results highlight the impact our higher e-com mix and our retail optimization strategy have on our profitability.\nWith regard to the bottom line, we are pleased with our results, especially in light of the quarter's challenging industry environment. Q2 operating income came in at $272 million and operating margin at 14.6%. While down 250 basis points below last year, 14.6% stands 770 basis points above 2019's 6.9%. These results reflect the power of our profitability initiatives and underpins our 15% operating margin long-term guidance. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.12 was $0.75 or 19% below last year's record second quarter earnings per share of $3.87 but significantly above 2019's earnings per share of only $0.87. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $514 million with no debt outstanding. This was after investing $43 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth and returning over $69 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nMerchandise inventories at $1.3 billion were down 15.7% to last year. The important points I'd like to emphasize here: first, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively managed our inventory levels in line with our demand trends; second, our in-stock levels are robust and near historical highs, and our regional balance and composition has improved considerably; and finally, third, our Q2 ending inventory levels are up only 9.5% versus same period in 2019. And that's with revenue comps of 40% over the same time frame. This highlights how we've improved our efficiency and turnover.\nSumming up our Q2 results. We're pleased to have delivered earnings exceeding expectations. I want to pause and thank all our associates across our stores, supply chain, customer service centers, global operations and corporate offices for delivering these results in a challenging environment.\nNow let's turn to our outlook. We are updating our fiscal '23 guidance to reflect both the ongoing top line uncertainty and the proven strength in our operating margin. We now expect full year '23 net revenues to be in a range of down 5% comp to down 10% comp, and we are increasing our operating margin outlook to a range of 15% to 16%. It's important to note that our lower sales outlook is offset by our raised operating margin, producing materially similar implied EPS guidance.\nOn the top line, our updated guidance is based upon the facts and trends we know today by extrapolating our 1-, 2- and 4-year trends in Q2 to full year '23 net revenues. Specifically, our Q2 1-year trend yields full year revenues at the low end of guidance. While our Q2 2-year trend yields full year revenues at the midpoint of guidance, and our Q2 4-year trend yields full year revenues at the high end of guidance. While our top line year-over-year comparison gets easier in the back half, we recognize the challenging environment for home furnishings.\nOn the bottom line, when aligned with historical quarter-over-quarter builds, our strong Q2 operating margin produces full year operating margin within our updated range of 15% to 16%. Additionally, in the back half of the year, our headwinds from the short-term supply chain costs will become tailwinds to support our operating margin guidance. We also expect our full year income tax rate to be approximately 26%. Our 2023 capital allocation plans remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize funding our business operations. Commensurate with our industry-leading return on invested capital, we will also invest $250 million in capital expenditures in high-return projects to support our long-term growth.\nAs we have communicated quarterly, we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, and we have almost $700 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization to repurchase our stock opportunistically. As we look further into the future, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit top line growth with operating margins exceeding 15%. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons: our ability to gain market share in the fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions."

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I want to begin by thanking our strong team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc., for their talent and hard work in delivering another solid quarter of earnings despite a challenging macro backdrop. With our focus on compelling products, customer service and profitability, we achieved our financial expectations.\nWe continue to distinguish ourselves as the world's largest digital-first, design-led, sustainable home retailer. What are the things that distinguish us? No other home furnishing company offers our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization. This allows us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at the best value to market that cannot be found anywhere else.\nMost importantly, it allows us to lead with innovation, distinguishing us from our competition. We are always looking for new opportunities to inspire our customers through our in-house design. From the new summer block prints and exclusive heritage quilts in Pottery Barn to the Vive Sobel Chair in West Elm to the compelling new dorm assortment in Pottery Barn team and the exclusive electronics and ergonomic tools in the Williams-Sonoma brand, our company leads with innovation.\nAnd just last week, we launched the newest brand in the Williams-Sonoma Inc. portfolio, Green Row. This new brand has been internally designed and developed, utilizing sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create powerful, vintage-inspired air and quality products.\nGreen Row addresses white space within our portfolio and in the market. It is this type of innovation that distinguishes us within the home furnishing industry and most importantly, resonates with our customers. But not only are we innovators, we are operators. As you know, no other home furnishings company offers our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy that's transforming the customer experience. With our proprietary e-commerce platform, we are one of the largest e-commerce players in the United States.\nAnd our in-house CRM and data analytics teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections. And we operate a world-class retail business with our stores serving as billboards for our brands.\nThey are beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments, our retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, most inspiring and most strategic locations, and our omni capabilities are a competitive advantage in the market.\nIn Q1, examples of our operational excellence continued. We replatform Rejuvenation's website, capturing new demand and driving higher conversions through enhanced imagery and an elevated customer experience.\nWe managed our SG&A expense leveraging our ad cost by limiting our spend to more proven efficient channels where customers show a higher level of intent to purchase. We made tough decisions to rightsize our organization to control costs and to drive focus and efficiency.\nWe managed our receipts to control inventory levels. And we are making substantial progress on our customer service, which was affected by the pandemic. We have successfully improved customer metrics, including on-time delivery.\nWe are working hard to rebalance inventory to reduce multiple and out-of-market shipments, both of which will improve service levels further and reduce costs. We are here to serve our customers without them, nothing else matters. Lastly, we lead the home furnishings industry with our sustainability efforts and values-based culture.\nIn Q1, we are recognized as one of the top 10 companies on Forbes list of America's Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. We were the highest ranking home furnishings retailer on the list.\nTurning to the quarter. While our top line comp ran down 6%, our 2-year comp was 3.5%, our full year comp to 2019 was plus 46.5%, and we delivered an operating margin of 12.9%, with earnings per share of $2.64, significantly above our pre-pandemic results.\nIn terms of demand, our trend softened from negative mid-single digits in Q4 to down 10% in Q1. The softness in demand was most notable in our high-ticket furniture offerings. But we didn't see that same trend in our high-ticket electronics and kitchen offerings. These disparate trends tells that the customer is still spending.\nThe diversification and durability within our portfolio of brands and product offerings positions us better than our competition with this shift in spending. Now let's turn to more details in the brands.\nPottery Barn ran down slightly with a negative 0.4% net comp in Q1, but ran 14% and on a 2-year basis and 54.4% on a 4-year basis. We are seeing subdued demand in our furniture business, with customers demonstrating more caution on high-ticket considered purchases.\nAnd in our outdoor business, we are seeing delayed purchasing until later in the summer season versus early spring. However, we are seeing strength in our exclusive decorating and textiles categories as customers choose to postpone bigger redesign projects to focus on easy updates, leveraging our beautiful print and pattern flows, table linen, bedding and bath textiles, frames and decorative lighting.\nIn PB, summer seasonal newness is off to a good start with strong demand for block print quilts and heritage patchwork quotes. The customer response to our Americana and coastal decorating across tabletop Textile and decor has been strong ahead of the Memorial Day weekend and should extend into the summer season.\nAs we look to the year ahead, the brand has a strong lineup of textiles decorating and entertaining products at a great value and we are increasing our marketing of these categories to drive performance. The Pottery Barn children's business ran a negative 3.3% comp in Q1. It was a negative 6.4% on a 2-year basis, but ran positive 29.6% on a 4-year basis.\nWe see pressure in some of our children's furniture categories, but we continue to see strength in many parts of the baby business. And we are focused on elevating the customer experience in these life stage businesses.\nFor example, in our baby business, we saw strength in our GREENGUARD gold nursery seating, personalized baby gift and our curated selection of Baby Gear, which positions us well as a destination for the registry business. And in our stores and across our mobile app, customers can register with Pottery Barn Kids and receive help from our nursery experts.\nIn our team brand, we are excited to have launched a compelling new dorm assortment covering the needs of college-bound students with extra-long twin bedding and storage. Customers can shop online and ship product to any of our company stores near their college campus.\nIncluded in our dorm offer, we are excited to showcase our partnership with Love Shack Fancy which has resonated with customers. Also, we are pleased with our first full quarter of results for our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen shopping apps.\nWe are seeing customers respond to the easy to shop thoughtfully designed experience and both apps are outperforming the mobile web across all KPIs. The West Elm brand continues to be the most affected by the tough macro environment. In Q1, West Elm ran a negative 15.8% and was negative 3% on a 2-year basis, but 51.1% positive on a 4-year basis.\nWe're excited that Dave Corn Blue started with the team as the new Brand President on April 3. She'll lead West through its next chapter of growth most immediately with a focus on 4 areas: one, industry-leading design and value; two, increasing brand awareness and customer acquisition; three, expanding into product white space, and four, leveraging channel growth opportunities.\nWest Elm is our brand with the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture. We see opportunity in West Elm as it expands into textile, decorating, accessories, entertaining and seasonal offerings. We continue to be very excited about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm.\nThe Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 4.4% comp in Q1. On a 2-year basis, the brand ran negative 6.7%, but positive 33.9% on a 4-year basis. The Williams-Sonoma team remains focused on increasing product exclusivity, innovation, relevant content and full price selling. We have a pipeline of innovative product launches and collaborations planned throughout the year, and we see new opportunities from the integration of the Williams-Sonoma Home furnishings assortment into our kitchen business. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in the housewares industry.\nNow I'd like to update you on our growth initiatives, beginning with business-to-business. This business has 2 formats: trade and contracts. The trade side of the business has been more impacted by the macro environment, but we continue to remain focused on the growth opportunity on the contract side.\nContract grew mid-double digits in the quarter despite B2B running down 7% in total. We continue to win B2B accounts due to our design capabilities and a wide range of products offered in our multi-brand portfolio. And in fact, we have a stronger pipeline of projects currently out for bid compared to last year. Another growth initiative is our expansion into global markets. Our brand momentum continues to exceed expectations in the India market and we are driving growth through retail expansion with the opening of our third West Elm store, our second Pottery Barn store and our first Pottery Barn Kids store in Q3 2023.\nIndia is a strategic market as we expand globally, and we plan to open additional locations in 2024. Additionally, we are seeing strength across all of our brands in the Middle East led by strong design services. We'll be expanding in the region with the opening of an additional Pottery Barn and West Elm store in Saudi Arabia in Q2.\nCanada is also a highlight with digital representing our biggest growth opportunity for the market. We launched B2B in Q1 in Canada, and we look forward to introducing the Canadian customer to rejuvenation Mark and Graham and Williams-Sonoma Home with the launch of their website later this year.\nIn summary, we recognize that there is continued uncertainty with the environment and the consumer. But we operate in a highly fragmented market, and we will continue to gain share by inspiring customers with our portfolio of strong brands and by building trust with a return to world-class customer service. And we will continue to generate strong profits.\nOn the guidance front, we are only 1 quarter into the fiscal year with a lot more volume to come. We have a lineup of opportunities in our brands which considered with our 2-year and 4-year trends supports our 2023 guidance. As we indicated in Q4, the first half of the year will be tougher with the strong comps we are up against in the declining macro.\nBut in the back half, our compares get easier, and our supply chain cost pressures start to roll off. Looking past the short term, we remain confident in our long-term guidance and our opportunity to furnish our customers everywhere.\nWe have built a company of loved brands with a shared platform of competitive differentiators that lead the industry: in-house design, a digital first but not digital-only platform and our values. We have identified opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives like B2B, Emerging Brands and Global where we have the opportunities to disrupt.\nWe have a culture of innovation and an experienced team who knows how to increase operational efficiency, control costs, deliver world-class customer service and drive new growth opportunities. And finally, with our focus on compelling products and restoring world-class customer service, along with our financial discipline and our great team, we are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our employees and our shareholders, all of whom I'd like to thank for their support. Now I will turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey E. Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that we've delivered solid quarter of earnings in a challenging environment. On the top line, we continue to distinguish ourselves from the home furnishing industry through the strength of our proprietary in-house design, our family of strong and stable brands and our culture of innovation.\nOn the bottom line, our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability. Despite softer top line results and illustrates how the structural changes in our operating model support our long-term 15% operating margin floor.\nBefore I walk through our Q1 results and our fiscal year '23 guidance, I'll first touch on our non-GAAP adjustments. As Laura said, we continue to distinguish ourselves through innovation and good operations. Laura touched on the innovation across our brands that will continue to propel our market share gains and the newest member of our family of brands, Green Row.\nOn the operations side, we are committed to driving efficiency across all our operations. As part of this commitment, we undertook 3 key initiatives to drive efficiency in Q1 that resulted in our recording $26 million in non-GAAP expenses. First, we completed a company-wide reduction in force, rightsizing our team domestically and internationally, primarily focused on corporate noncustomer-facing positions.\nSecond, we closed our Southern West Coast upholstery manufacturing facility, moving our production from California to our lower-cost Southeastern U.S. facilities. Third, we exited our noncore Aperture SaaS business. Combined, these changes will result not only in an estimated annualized savings of $40 million, but also increased focus and efficiency across our corporate supply chain and technology teams. For more details, please refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP schedule in our press release.\nNow let's dive into our Q1 results. As I do so, in addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with pre-pandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.755 billion, slightly below our expectations. While comparable brand revenue growth on the 1-year stack came in at negative 6%, our 2-year stack grew 3.5% and our full year stack against 2019 grew 46.5%.\nIn demand, we were up against our toughest 1-year compares the year, leading Q1 demand to come in at negative 10% on a 1-year stack. However, our demand was negative 1% on a 2-year stack and positive 46.7% on a 4-year stack. Our net revenues were driven by strong order fulfillment and timing of revenue recognition as we had less undelivered orders in Q1 than in Q4.\nFor context, in a normalized environment, typically, there is a spread between demand and net comps. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin at 38.6% was in line with our expectations. Coming in 520 basis points below last year, reflects the impact of the short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies flowing through our income statement that we've been discussing in the past several quarters.\nMerchandise margins decreased from last year as we experienced the full effect of the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demerge into our income statement. This was partially offset by the higher pricing power, our proprietary products command and by our ongoing commitment to forgo site-wide promotions.\nSelling margin continued to be impacted by higher outbound customer shipping costs as well. We continue to incur these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-to-market distribution centers. And, in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.\nWe're working hard to rebalance our inventory composition and regional inventory location to improve our customer service. As Laura touched on, we are pleased with the improvements in customer service we are already seeing, and we expect customer service will continue to improve over the course of 2023.\nAltogether, our selling margins were 350 basis points lower than last year. We estimate more than 300 of the 350 basis points are attributable to the short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies I just discussed.\nAt 38.6%, our Q1 gross margin remains 270 basis points higher than 2019, 35.9%. And that's inclusive of absorbing these more than 300 basis points in supply chain-related costs and inefficiencies.\nOccupancy costs at 11.5% of net revenues were 170 basis points above last year with occupancy dollars increasing 8.6% to approximately $202 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiatives partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast.\nThese new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time. Our 250 basis points leverage versus 2019's 14% occupancy rate demonstrates the impact our higher e-com mix and retail optimization has had on our gross margin.\nOur SG&A rate continues to be at a historic low for Q1 at 25.7%, leveraging 100 basis points over last year. This reflects our financial discipline and ability to control costs in a challenging environment. We held employment expenses as a rate of revenues flat to last year as we manage variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends.\nOur advertising leverage continues to reflect the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform are an underappreciated competitive advantage that allow us to drive efficient advertising spend in near real time as we see trends evolve in the business.\nOverall, SG&A came in 320 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.9%. This once again highlights the impact of our higher e-com mix and retail optimization on our profitability.\nWith regard to the bottom line, we are pleased with our results despite the quarter's declining macroeconomic backdrop. Q1 operating income came in at $226 million, and operating margin at 12.9%, while down 420 basis points below last year, 12.9% stands 590 basis points above 2019's 7%.\nThese results reflect the durability of our profitability and underpin our 15% operating margin long-term guidance. Announcement quarter marked by significant macroeconomic headwinds, softer top line results and over 300 basis points in short-term supply chain-related cost pressures.\nOur diluted earnings per share of $2.64 was $0.86 or 25% below last year's record first quarter earnings per share of $3.50, but significantly above 2019's earnings per share of $0.81. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $297 million with no debt outstanding.\nThis is inclusive of investing $50 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, paying $58 million in quarterly dividends and opportunistically repurchasing 300 million or 3.8% of shares outstanding, congruent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\nMerchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, at $1.402 billion were essentially flat year-over-year while inventory on hand increased 28% over last year. Two important points to emphasize here once again. First, our inventory on hand increase continues to be skewed by last year's pandemic-related supply chain disruption creating an artificially low base.\nAn apples-to-apples comparison versus 2019, highlights how we've improved our inventory turnover as our on-hand inventory levels have increased only 19% against revenue growth of over 41% during that time. Second, our lower balance sheet inventory growth reflects a 46% reduction in merchandise and transit as we've aligned our future on order with cautious forward-looking demand given our Q1 trends and the macroeconomic outlook.\nSumming up our Q1, we are pleased to have delivered results in line with our expectations. We continue to distinguish ourselves within a fragmented home furnishings industry. Our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability and our ability to maintain at least a 15% operating margin over the long term.\nI want to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in delivering these results in a challenging environment. Now let's turn to our guidance for 2023. As we look to the balance of the year, we are reiterating our fiscal '23 guidance.\nWe recognize there is uncertainty in the macro and the consumer is becoming increasingly cautious, but this is our best estimate based on the facts and trends we know today. On the top line, extrapolating our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1 and to full year '23 revenues land us within our guidance range.\nSpecifically, our Q1 2-year trend yields full year revenues at the low end of guidance. While our Q1 4-year trend yields full year revenues between the midpoint and high end of guidance. On the bottom line, our Q1 results project our operating margin landing within our guidance especially with the cost reductions we undertook this quarter.\nWe continue to anticipate the first half of the year will be materially tougher. On the top line, our year-over-year demand comparisons and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro will yield negative comps. On the bottom line, we continue to foresee gross margin pressures as the supply chain cost sitting on our balance sheet continue to amortize into our income statement as well as ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customers.\nIn the back half of the year, these headwinds should turn into tailwinds as our top line year-over-year comparisons get easier and our gross margin pressures become tailwinds that support our profitability. As we look beyond 2023, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business.\nWe believe our long-term growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth with operating margins exceeding a for 15%. As the world's largest digital first, design-led, sustainable home retailer, we're committed to finishing our customers everywhere. And we're confident that we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons.\nOur ability to gain market share in the fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design. The competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions."

Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, CAO & Head of IR, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '23 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. Specifically, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.7 million in the fourth quarter to write off certain software and hardware costs and goodwill associated with Aperture, a division of our Outward subsidiary. This impairment charge does not affect our ongoing use or strategy of the Outward Technology in our portfolio of brands and in our design and room planning functionality.\nAccordingly, our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '22 have been adjusted for this impairment charge. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC.\nFinally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. At Williams-Sonoma, Inc., we're proud that despite the declining macro environment, we delivered another year of record revenue and record earnings. With our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth, we continue to outperform our peers. We continue to gain market share, and we continue to distinguish ourselves as the world's largest digital-first, design-led sustainable home retailer. And what are these things that distinguish us? No other home furnishings company offers our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization.\nIt allows us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at the best value to market that cannot be found anywhere else. No other home furnishings company offers our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy that's transforming the customer experience. With our proprietary e-commerce platform, we are one of the largest e-commerce players in the United States. Our in-house CRM and data analytic teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections.\nAnd our great stores not only deliver an outstanding customer experience, but also in 2022, we expanded our services with ship to store as we transition our stores to also service design centers in omni fulfillment hubs. And no other home furnishings company has our strong record on value that many consumers want today. In Q4, we are proud to be named to Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. The Morgan Stanley Capital International ESG assessment gave us a AAA rating, the highest possible. And we were included on the 2022 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America, the only new retailer added to the North America list in 2022.\nAlong with our key differentiators, our success and profitability has been driven by our new growth initiatives that are cross brand and/or outside of our core brands. Our largest cross-brand growth driver is business to business. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is no longer just a home furnishings company. We furnish our customers everywhere from restaurants to hotels, from football stadiums to office spaces. We set the ambitious goal this year to reach $1 billion in demand in our B2B business, and we came very close, driving 27% year-over-year growth and 166% on a 2-year basis.\nAnd we continue to win B2B accounts due to our design capabilities and a wide range of products offered in our multi-brand portfolio. Another successful growth initiative is our expansion into global markets. In the massive market of India, our new partnership with the Reliance Group is off to a very strong start. With our exclusive and differentiated product line, our 3 stores and websites in India are outperforming our expectations in a market where we see tremendous opportunity. And in Canada, we relaunched our website and saw improvements in conversion and AUR across brands.\nIn our new businesses, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham have also provided incremental growth. Together, in fiscal 2022, they represented nearly $270 million in revenues and drove nearly a 10% comp on the year. These 2 brands service white space needs of customers. At Rejuvenation, we're expanding into remodel categories related to kitchen and bathroom, including vanities, cabinet hardware and custom wall lighting. And at Mark and Graham, our high-quality gift and personalization business is resonating with our customers, and we see outsized growth in the travel space, including luggage and accessories.\nOur core brands, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm and Williams-Sonoma are also key contributors to our strong fiscal 2022, together growing at 6.4%. Put it all together, our key differentiators and our growth initiatives, and you see the results that we are reporting today. We're proud that we achieved our fiscal '22 annual guidance and delivered a 6.5% comp on the top line and an operating margin of 17.5%.\nAt the same time, we drove EPS growth of over 11% to $16.54 per share from $14.85 last year. As I said at the top, we continue to outperform our peers in a year where the industry grew 1%, we grew more than 5%. All of this is particularly impressive given the declining macro backdrop in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and the record demand that we are up against in 2021. Stepping back for a moment and looking at the last 12 years, it's clear that we've consistently delivered. And more recently, since 2019, we've grown our revenues more than 47%, adding $2.8 billion to the top line.\nWe've also more than doubled our operating margin from 8.6% to 17.5%. Now let's talk specifically about Q4. Our Q4 results were achieved while the macro backdrop weakened. Our demand comps were in the negative mid-single-digit comp range and were inconsistent across our portfolio of brands leading to a net revenue comp of negative 0.6% total company. In addition, although supply chain cost increases pressured our margins, we were able to offset these headwinds with SG&A cost savings producing an operating margin of 19.9% and earnings per share of $5.50 in Q4.\nNow let's talk about our brands for Q4 and for the full year. Pottery Barn ran a positive 5.8% comp in Q4 and a 14.9% on the full year. On a 3-year basis, Pottery Barn generated a 54% comp. Pottery Barn's inspirational product offering and successful execution of its growth initiatives like the Accessible Home, Apartment and Marketplace drove the performance. Also, our holiday offering was successful. As we look to the year ahead, the brand has a strong lineup of product offerings, including new products with great design and sharp price points.\nThe Pottery Barn Children's business ran a positive 4% comp in Q4 and a positive 0.4% on the year. On a 3-year basis, the Children's business generated a 28.6% comp. Growth continued to be driven from Baby and Dorm. And another highlight is our successful introduction of our exclusive collaboration with the trending fashion brand, LoveShackFancy, which is outperforming our expectations. Also, in both Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen, we're excited to have launched a new native shopping app, which brings enhanced functionality and provides customers with an easy-to-use interface. We've only been live with the app for a short time, but we are seeing positive response, and we'll continue to read the results to determine if we should launch apps for our other brands.\nIn Q4, the Children's business benefited from an improved in-stock position, which is critical to this life stage business and will continue to benefit us this year. The West Elm brand was most affected by the tough macro environment. In Q4, West Elm ran a negative 10.7%, coming off very strong multiyear comps. On a full year basis, West Elm ran a 2.5% comp and very strong operating margins. On a 3-year basis, the West Elm brand generated a 50.8% comp.\nLooking ahead, we're very excited about the recent announcement of Day Kornbluth as the new brand president effective April 3. Day has a proven track record and previous success growing home furnishings brands. To lead West Elm through its next chapter of growth with a focus on 4 areas: industry-leading design and value; increased brand awareness and customer acquisition; expanding into product white space; and leveraging channel growth opportunity.\nGiven the cautious consumer, we continue to see short-term softness. But with Day Kornbluth leading this brand, the total addressable market opportunity and the focus on those 4 areas, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm. Finally, the Williams-Sonoma brand had a successful holiday season, but ran a negative 2.5% comp in Q4, largely driven by softness in January.\nOn the full year, the brand ran a negative 1.7% comp. On a 3-year basis, Williams-Sonoma generated a 32.6% comp. And while the housewares market has become extremely promotional, the Williams-Sonoma team remains focused on increasing product exclusivity, innovation, relevant content and full price selling. We have a pipeline of innovative product launches and chef collaborations planned throughout the year, and we see new opportunities from the integration of the Williams-Sonoma Home Furnishing's assortment into our kitchen business.\nLooking ahead, we recognize that with the weak housing market, layoffs and a possible recession, there's a lot of uncertainty with the consumer. Nevertheless, we remain confident with our key differentiators and our growth initiatives, we're confident in our top line. With our focus on reducing costs and managing inventory levels, we're confident on our bottom line. And with the home furnishings market remaining large and fragmented, including the B2B market at an estimated $80 billion TAM, we're confident that we will continue to gain market share.\nWith our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth and its inflation and costs, including shipping come down, we're confident that will drive operating margins of more than 14%, as Jeff will discuss in more detail. Looking even further out, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm. I believe we're going to get through the coming environment better than any of our peers. We are going to keep delivering profitable growth, and we believe we can deliver a mid- to high single-digit top line growth and sustain our operating margin of at least 15% once the external environment improves.\nThis is a great company with great brands and with our culture of innovation and talent, our values and the strength of our team, we're moving ahead with our vision to furnish our customers everywhere. As we do, we're confident that we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver for all of our customers, employees and shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, because of our key differentiators and growth initiatives, 2022 was another record year of revenue and earnings with our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth. We have outperformed our peers, and we continue to gain market share. Now I will walk you through our fiscal 2022 results, our Q4 results and then 2023 guidance.\nMore specifically, full year 2022 net revenues grew in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth, finishing at $8.674 billion, a 6.5% comp on top of the 22% comp in 2021 and a 17% comp in 2020. With our digital first but not digital-only platform, we saw growth across both channels, with e-commerce growing 4.5% comp and retail 11.1%. E-commerce now represents 66% of our total revenues. Gross margin at 42.4% of net revenues, deleveraged 160 basis points from last year. That happened as we absorb the ongoing impact of COVID supply chain disruption and global inflationary pressure.\nWith our strong financial discipline and cost control, we were able to materially offset these headwinds in gross margin as SG&A at 24.9% of net revenue, leveraged 140 basis points from last year. Operating margin of 17.5% was consistent with our full year guidance of being materially in line with our fiscal year '21 results and demonstrates the resiliency and profitability of our operating models.\nDiluted earnings per share of $16.54, grew 11% over last year's $14.85, another record year of earnings for our shareholders. In fact, we're proud that 2022 constitutes the fourth consecutive year of EPS growth for our shareholders, another example of how we've consistently delivered. Likewise, our fortress balance sheet and consistent ability to generate free cash flow allowed us to fund our business operations, increase our capital investments to $354 million to support our long-term growth, and returned over $1 billion in excess cash to our shareholders.\nDividend payouts were approximately $217 million or $3.12 per share, represented the 13th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. Coupled with our share repurchases of $880 million, this shows our strong commitment to maximizing total returns for our shareholders. And here's another example of our financial discipline and commitment to driving long-term growth for our shareholders. Our 49% return on invested capital, inclusive of our higher capital investments and increased inventory levels, our ROIC is among the best in the retail industry.\nDecember 2022 results, we're proud to have delivered another year of record revenues and earnings. I want to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in driving these great results. Turning to our Q4 results. As Laura said, we continue to outperform our peers. This was despite the quarter's ongoing demand choppiness and declining macroeconomic backdrop. With our ability to gain market share through the strength of our proprietary in-house design and our family of strong and stable brands, our top line outperformed the industry.\nOur resilient operating margin demonstrates the power of our operating model to sustain profitability. Net revenues came in at $2.453 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth at negative 0.6%. Demand on the quarter was in the mid-single-digit negative comp range, decelerating from Q3's demand trends. We saw a strong holiday season book ended by a soft early November and a soft January. Our net revenues were driven by strong order fulfillment, ongoing momentum in our growth initiatives and our continued ability to take market share even as we continue to experience inconsistent demand.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin of 41.2%, was in line with our expectations. Coming in 380 basis points below last year, it reflects the impact of the higher input costs flowing through our income statement, including higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demurrage as well as our efforts to meet our customer service expectations. Merchandise margins decreased from last year as we started to absorb the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demerge into our income statement. This was partially offset by the higher pricing power, our proprietary products command and by our ongoing commitment to forgo site-wide promotions.\nThe gross margin decline was also attributable to higher outbound customer shipping costs. We continue to incur these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers, and, in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment. We're working hard to rebalance our inventory composition and regional inventory location to improve our customer service.\nWe expect customer service to gradually improve over the next few quarters. Occupancy costs at 8.3% of net revenues were 60 basis points above last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 5% to approximately $204 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiatives partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time.\nOur SG&A rate continues to be at a historic low at 21.3%, leveraging 270 basis points over last year, showcasing our financial discipline and ability to control costs. Employment leverage to last year as we manage variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends and adjusted incentive compensation with business performance. Our advertising leverage reflects the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team.\nOur in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform are an underappreciated competitive advantage that allows us to drive efficient advertising spend in near real time as we see trends evolve in the business. SG&A also includes recoveries from insurance in the fourth quarter. With regard to the bottom line, we delivered another solid quarter of earnings in a challenging environment.\nQ4 operating income of $487 million and operating margin at 19.9%, which is only 110 basis points below last year, reflects the durability of our profitability, despite significant macroeconomic headwinds and inflationary cost pressures. Our record diluted earnings per share of $5.50, was $0.08 or 1.5% above last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.42. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $367 million and no debt outstanding. This is inclusive of consistently paying our quarterly dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares congruent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\nMerchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, at $1.456 billion, increased 17% over last year, while inventory on hand increased 40% over last year. There are 3 important points to emphasize here. First, our inventory on hand increase is skewed by last year's pandemic-related supply chain disruption, creating an artificially low base. An apples-to-apples comparison versus 2019 highlights how we've improved our inventory turnover as our on-hand inventory levels have increased only 21% against revenue growth of over 47% during that time.\nSecond, supply chain congestion eased earlier than anticipated in Q4. Like many retailers, we adjusted our transit times during the pandemic and received receipts substantially earlier than we expected in Q4 as transit times normalize. While this contributed to our increased inventory levels, it enabled us to substantially reduce our backlog to normalized levels.\nThird, our lower balance sheet inventory growth reflects a 40% reduction in merchandise in transit, as we've aligned our future on order with cautious forward-looking demand given the macroeconomic outlook. To sum up our Q4 results, we've outperformed our industry. Our top line proves our ability to take market share. Our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability, and our record earnings per share is testimony to our commitment to maximize shareholder returns.\nNow let's look ahead to 2023. Due to the macroeconomic uncertainty, we are providing a wide range of guidance for '23. 2023 net revenues are expected to be in the range of down 3 comp to positive 3 comp, with operating margins between 14% and 15%. We expect the first half of the year will be materially tougher. On the top line, our year-over-year demand comparisons and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro will likely yield negative comps.\nOn the bottom line, we continue to foresee gross margin pressure, as we saw in Q4. The higher input costs sitting on our balance sheet will continue to amortize into our income statement as well as ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customers. In the back half of the year, these headwinds should turn into tailwinds as our top line year-over-year comparisons get easier and our gross margin pressures become tailwinds that support our profitability.\nOur capital allocation plans for 2023 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in our long-term growth. We expect to spend $250 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. This constitutes a 30% decrease from 2022, with 80% of the spend dedicated to driving our e-commerce leadership through technology enhancements and supply chain efficiency initiatives. We expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases.\nFor dividends, today, we announced another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 15% or $0.12 to $0.90 per share. Again, fiscal year '23 will be the 14th consecutive year of increased dividend payout, which we are both proud of and committed to. For share repurchases, today, we also announced our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, under which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders.\nCombined, our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization continue our commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fact, we returned over $3.2 billion to our shareholders over the last 5 years, which is yet another example of how we've consistently delivered. As Laura said, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business as we look beyond 2023.\nOur long-term growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth, with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%. As the world's largest digital-first, design-led sustainable home retailer, we're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons. Our ability to gain market share in the fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the strength of our growth initiatives, our ability to control costs, the durability of our profitability and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\nWith that, I'll open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, CAO & Head of IR, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during the call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22.\nWe believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears on exhibit one to the press release we issued earlier today. The call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC.\nFinally, a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. We are proud of another strong quarter, generating an 8.1% comp or 25% on a 2-year basis and 50% comp growth on a 3-year basis, with record EPS growth of 12% over last year to $3.72 per share. These results reflect the continuation of backlog order fulfillment, strong product margins and disciplined cost control.\nDemand comps for the quarter were slightly negative. This continued outperformance reflects the unique strength of our multi-brand portfolio, our growth initiatives and ongoing execution of our talented team. Since we last spoke, the macro backdrop has become more uncertain. However, what has not changed is the large and fragmented space in which we operate, where no one player owns significant market share.\nWe believe we have an ability to capture more of this market in any environment. We have and will continue to deliver results, leveraging our key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital first but not digital-only capabilities and our value. These competitive advantages in combination with our growth strategies give us many opportunities for the future. As we talked about before, one of our largest is B2B, which had another excellent quarter, driving over $30 million in demand, a 17% increase to last year.\nWe continue to believe our B2B business presents a sizable growth driver for us as it disrupts an underserved estimated $80 billion total addressable market. B2B is building velocity with large and repeat projects from commercial and hospitality partners like Marriott and Hilton. We are also focused on diversifying into new industry verticals, including the healthcare space through multiproperty partnerships with national accounts. In September, we successfully launched our improved corporate gifting and custom merchandise services, and we are encouraged by the early success leading into the holiday season.\nA key B2B customer of ours for over 3 years now in Starbucks. We are thrilled to publicly announce that our team was able to assist Starbucks with the build-out of the gorgeous 3-story flagship reserve store in the Empire State Building. In addition to incorporating furniture from Brooklyn-based West Elm, our B2B team had the opportunity to work with Starbucks to create custom furniture solutions to meet their unique needs. We look forward to growing our existing relationship with Starbucks.\nAnd now I'd like to talk about our global business where we continue to expand in key markets and grow our multichannel presence. In Q3, we saw strength in both franchise and company-owned. In the franchise business, we believe that one of our biggest opportunities is in India. And after launching our website earlier this year, we opened our first Pottery Barn store in New Delhi, joining our West Elm stores in New Delhi and Mumbai. We plan to continue to focus on in India and in early 2023, will be adding stores across our brands and continuing to improve our online experience with our great partner, the Reliance Group. In our company-owned business, I want to highlight Canada where we successfully relaunched our website this year across all the brands, driving order fulfillment and improved omni experience. Another important initiative is sustainability for which we continue to be recognized for our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishing industry. In Q3, we were named a top score on sustainable furnishings counsel wood furniture scorecard for the fifth consecutive year, and West Elm received the Ford Stewardship Council Leadership Award for its use of FSC certified wood.\nWe recognize there is much more work to do in this space, and we are committed to continuing to be a leader in planet, people and purpose. One of our sustainability initiatives is our goal to plant 6 million trees across our family of brands in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation. We are excited to report that we have planted over 2 million trees to date.\nNow let's turn to the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn delivered yet another very strong quarter with a 19.6% comp or 35.5% on a 2-year stack and almost 60% on a 3-year stack. Pottery Barn continues to perform, offering exclusive high-quality inspirational products and strategic growth areas like apartment, marketplace and bath reno are driving results.\nWe're particularly proud of our accessible home collection, which launched in late July and has quickly scaled. West Elm delivered a 4.2% comp in the third quarter or 26.6% on a 2-year stack and 48.4% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we improved our in-stock inventory position, and we expect to continue to make improvements in our service levels into Q4 and next year. We are also very focused on improving our e-commerce experience and customer-facing conversion-driving initiatives.\nI've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with West Elm this quarter, and I am very impressed with the talented and passionate team running the brand. Our greatest opportunity at West Elm is doubling down on what has made this brand great, our commitment to design innovation and value price points.\nNow I'd like to update you on the Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 4.8% comp in Q3 but a positive 12.1% on a 2-year basis and a positive 35.9% on a 3-year basis. We continue to see ongoing recovery in our in-stocks. And looking to the future, we have a strong pipeline of products at compelling values. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 1.5% comp in Q3, but a positive 6.1% on a 2-year and a positive 36.5% on a 3-year basis.\nWe continue to see that people are hosting and entertaining at home. And as such, we saw strength in entertaining areas. In Q3, we successfully kicked off the holiday season with our exclusive collaboration with celebrity chefs and author, Ina Garten. As part of this collaboration, Ina shared Thanksgiving tips for cooking and hosting the ultimate Thanksgiving dinner party. We also announced the exciting launch of a collaboration with renowned British heritage textile brand, William Morrison Company. Williams-Sonoma Home delivered another double-digit comp in Q3. We continue to see this business as an opportunity to deliver outsized growth by picking up market share from the limited luxury high-end home market. We're excited to launch an expanded furnishing line for the kitchen in Q4. As we look to the holiday season, we are prepared to meet the needs of our gift giving customers with compelling product offerings.\nOur stores are a competitive advantage, and they are stocked and our associates are ready to serve our customers. And finally, our emerging brands, including Rejuv and Mark and Graham, together, they ran a 7.8% comp this quarter. At Rejuvenation, we saw success in remodel categories related to kitchen and bathroom, including vanities, cabinet hardware and wall widening. And at Mark and Graham, wins were from the travel category, including luggage and travel accessories. We are proud of our third quarter results. but we are also aware that economic uncertainty is on the minds of consumers and investors alike.\nDuring the third quarter, we experienced deceleration and choppiness in our demand, and it is hard to know where the economy is going or how long the uncertainty will last. Nonetheless, we are controlling what we can control and looking at opportunities to reduce costs without an impact to the customer experience. In fact, we believe that protecting service and innovation is key to outperforming our peers.\nAs it relates to pricing, we continue to be committed to not running site-wide promotions as we did before the pandemic, but we will continue to mark down and clear overstocks. We are working with our vendors to reduce costs and pass on that value strategically to our customers. As for additional expenses, out of market and redundant shipping expenses and transportation costs have negatively impacted our gross margin. We continue to focus on these pressures and mitigation of these costs will be a significant benefit for us in the future, particularly in the second half of next year.\nIn summary, we are conscious that the home furnishings market may contract due to macro factors. If this happens, we believe we are uniquely positioned to take market share even if there is a downturn, and here's why. We built a company of loved brands with a shared platform of competitive differentiators that leads the industry, in-house design, digital first but not digital-only platform and our value. We have identified opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives like B2B, global end marketplace where we have the opportunity to disrupt. And finally, we have a culture of innovation and an experienced team who knows how to increase operational efficiencies and control costs while protecting service and driving new growth opportunities.\nNow I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the results in more detail in his first earnings call as CFO.\n\nJeff Howie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. I am so pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role as Chief Financial Officer. While I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year member of the Williams-Sonoma leadership team. I come into this role with deep knowledge and experience across our brands, operations and financials. I look forward to applying my breadth and depth of experience to drive continued strong results.\nDiving into our third quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record revenues and earnings in a challenging environment. Our top line results illustrate our ability to gain market share. Our bottom line results demonstrate the power of our operating model to sustain merchandise margins and control SG&A expenses.\nNet revenues grew to $2.2 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth at 8.1% for a 2-year comp of 25% and a 3-year comp of almost 50%. Our revenue growth was driven by strong order fulfillment, ongoing momentum in our growth initiatives and our continued ability to take market share, even as we experienced inconsistent demand within our portfolio of brands and across the quarter. Both channels continued to experience strong growth, with retail at a 16.9% comp and e-commerce at a 4.4% comp.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin was 41.5%, 220 basis points below last year and in line with our expectations. We sustained strong merchandise margins that were flat year-over-year. We remain committed to our decision to no longer offer site-wide promotions and preserve the pricing integrity our proprietary, differentiated product commands.\nThe strength of these merchandise margins is particularly impressive given we absorbed significant cost increases from our vendors and ocean carriers, including higher demurrage and detention charges. As expected, the gross margin decline was driven by higher outbound shipping costs. This is due to our increased furniture mix, higher back order fulfillment and incremental freight costs. We also incurred higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.\nOccupancy costs at 9.2% of net revenues were 30 basis points above last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 10.5% to approximately $202 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiative partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time.\nOur SG&A rate continues to be at historic lows at 26%, leveraging 150 basis points over last year, driven by advertising and employment leverage. Our advertising leverage reflects the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team, our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform allow us to test, learn and scale, which is a unique competitive advantage.\nOur SG&A leverage also reflects our culture of financial discipline, where we consistently challenge all expenses for return on investment and drive operational efficiency throughout the company. On the bottom line, we delivered another record quarter of earnings. Q3 operating income grew 2% to $340 million, and we delivered strong operating margin at 15.5%, only 80 basis points below last year despite significant headwinds and cost pressures. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.72, was up 12% from last year's record third quarter earnings per share of $3.32.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $113 million, with no debt outstanding and year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million. That enabled us to fund the operations of the business and expand our capital investments to support our long-term growth. In addition, year-to-date, we have returned excess cash of over $1 billion to shareholders through $165 million in dividends and $840 million in share repurchases.\nThese decisions reflect our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. And with our strong and disciplined balance sheet, combined with our expected free cash flow, we have flexibility to continue to invest in the growth of the business and opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term shareholder returns.\nMoving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in transit, were $1.688 billion, increasing 33% over our reduced level of last year. Inventory on hand increased 34% over last year, but was up only 11% to 2019 versus sales up 52% over the same time. In the quarter, back order levels decreased but remained well above historical levels. We are working hard to get these goods in to fulfill our customer orders but continue to anticipate our backorder levels will remain elevated in the first half of '23.\nSummarizing our Q3 results, we are proud to have delivered another quarter of record revenues and earnings. I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in driving these great results. Now turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year and beyond. We acknowledge that the near-term macroeconomic picture remains uncertain, with conflicting economic signals surrounding consumer spending trends, decade high inflation and Federal Reserve monetary policy, intentionally moderating economic demand.\nAdditionally, our trends have been increasingly inconsistent and less predictable. This combination of conflicting economic signals and inconsistent trends makes our guidance unusually difficult to predict. However, we remain confident in our ability to operate in any environment, and are, therefore, reiterating our fiscal year '22 guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year '21.\nOur outlook is grounded in 3 factors. First, we are currently in the early stages of our upcoming holiday seasonal rent with the biggest weeks yet to come. Second, our Q3 quarter demand trends support a wide range of outcomes. And third, the ongoing improvement we see in fulfillment of our customer order backlog. From a profitability perspective, as we said in our last call, we continue to expect cost pressures to persist for the balance of fiscal year '22 and into the first half of '23, primarily across our supply chain.\nThese headwinds include our incremental distribution centers, higher product and freight costs and our efforts to best serve our customers by delivering products as timely as possible. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. In fiscal year '22, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $350 million. We plan to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.\nWhile the near term may be uncertain, the current management team has successfully navigated challenging environments before, including the 2008 great financial crisis and the 2020 global pandemic. We know the levers to pull, and we have already taken steps to reduce cost and inventory to mitigate downside risk.\nGiven the increased macro uncertainty, we will not be reiterating or updating our fiscal year '24 guidance at this time. We will be providing guidance for fiscal year '23 and beyond at our next call. We remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. Our confidence remains rooted in our ability to take market share in the fractured home furnishings industry. The strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\nAnd having been here before, we see opportunity to take an offensive stance in a challenging macro environment. In summary, we are very proud of our results. We continue to deliver for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. And now I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

Q2 2022 Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nToday's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, CAO & Head of IR, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call.\nI'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22 and our long-term outlook.

Those measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, along with an explanation of how and why we use those measures, appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier today. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual filings with the SEC. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone.\nI'm excited to share our second quarter earnings today. Q2 marked another quarter of strong performance, delivering an 11.3% comp on the top line and earnings growth of over 19% to $3.87 per share. These impressive results reflect the strength of our multi-brand portfolio, the success of our growth initiatives and the ongoing execution of the team. We continue to demonstrate our ability to perform by offering high-quality, differentiated and sustainable products that our customers know and love.\nOur performance was driven by 3 factors: strong order fulfillment, positive demand comps and our successful continued elimination of site-wide promotions. I'm very proud of this performance, especially given the macroeconomic backdrop and the strong compares we are up against, all while delivering an impressive 41.1% comp on a 2-year basis. And it is this continued outperformance that gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2022 guidance and longer-term outlook today.\nOur positioning in the industry is a competitive strength. Our industry is large and fragmented with more than half of sales from small brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have sophisticated e-commerce capabilities. And with the arrival of the millennial generation for the household creation stage, this is a huge opportunity for ongoing market share gains for us, while the rest of the players try to catch up.\nAt the same time, our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both retail and marketplace only players. All of this creates an environment that is ripe for disruption and for us to take market share.\nWe continue to win because of our key differentiators, which include our in-house design capabilities with inspirational, exclusive, sustainable and high-quality products at compelling price points. Our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy and our values rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, which are becoming even more fundamental to purchasing decisions for many customers. These differentiators set us apart as a leader in the industry.\nAnd now I want to highlight one of our opportunities, business to business. Our B2B business had another terrific quarter driving a 32% increase in demand in Q2 and it is well on track to becoming a $1 billion business this year. We continue to grow in this space by focusing on diversifying our product pipeline across a range of industry verticals.\nIn sports and entertainment, we are excited to service our first collegiate sports facility at San Diego State New Snapdragon Stadium. In hospitality, we continue to gain market share through renovations and new builds, leveraging our diverse fleet of brands. And in our commercial office pipeline, we are encouraged to see the momentum continue as companies return to the office and workspaces are reimagined.\nTo drive the B2B growth, we are focused on the continued development of our sales team and expansion of our contract-grade product assortment. We remain optimistic and excited about the potential of this business as there is no one else providing the full suite of services and offerings that we do.\nMoving to sustainability. We are thrilled to announce the recent publication of our 2021 impact report highlighting the progress and fulfillment of our industry-leading ESG goals. We remain committed to prioritizing sustainability, diversity, philanthropy and worker well-being as key differentiators for our business. In the report, we detailed progress on our long-standing commitment, including responsibly sourced cotton and wood, waste diversion and increased fair trade premium. We are also one of the first home furnishing brands to set a science-based target for reducing our emissions across our company, and we have made progress decreasing our carbon intensity.\nNow I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue to believe that global expansion represents a sizable opportunity, and we are focused on a multichannel strategy in key markets. In Q2, we continued building momentum with our franchise partnerships. Our presence in Mexico continues to drive growth, and we launched the Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids websites in India with stores beginning in Q3 of this year and further expansion into 2023. And in our company-owned business in Canada, we continue to expand our family of brands with the launch of our Pottery Barn Teen website and the relaunches of Williams-Sonoma West Elm in our Pottery Barn Kids website in the market, all with great customer response.\nBefore we get to the strong results of the brand, I want to update you on the supply chain. Unfortunately, this is an area where we continue to see significant disruption, inefficiencies and cost pressures. Although our in-stock position has improved, we have still room to improve our on-time shipments to customers. Also, we continue to incur higher distribution center costs to support our growth as well as higher ocean freight. And we are still incurring added costs to ship out of market and multiple shipments to service our customers. We expect this pressure will continue in the second half of this year and the first half of next. This is reflected in our guidance and our outlook.\nNow let's turn to the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn delivered another extremely strong quarter with a 21.5% comp or 51.1% on a 2-year basis. All channels and product divisions contributed to driving incremental demand. Our high-quality proprietary furniture business continues to lead the growth.\nPottery Barn continues to innovate with product and incremental growth initiatives. For example, in July, Pottery Barn launched the Accessible Home, an exciting new concept designed to enhance the quality of life at home with aging in-place community and people living with disabilities and injury. Our customers have responded enthusiastically about our efforts to address this underserved market, and we believe this could be a significant opportunity across our portfolio of brands.\nMoving to West Elm. West Elm delivered a 6.1% comp in the second quarter on top of 51.1% last year or 57.2% on a 2-year basis. We're excited about our new businesses in kids and bath, which continue to drive outsized growth for the brand. And we launched our dedicated B2B e-commerce experience and expanded assortment there.\nLooking forward to Q3, we are focused on 3 key areas of growth at West Elm. One, improving furniture in-stocks and lead time reductions; two, expanding our depth in seasonal decorating, hosting and entertainment categories; and three, launching innovative collaborations across the brand. And with the ongoing success of our strategic initiatives, we remain confident in our ability to drive West Elm to become a $3 billion brand.\nNow I'd like to update you on our Pottery Barn children's home furnishing business, which delivered a sequentially stronger quarter with a 5.3% comp in Q2. During the quarter, we benefited from improving inventory receipts out of Vietnam, which filed factory closures that occurred in the back half of 2021. Also, we successfully launched our biggest ever back-to-school collection, and we enabled functionality to ship dorm products in any store in any brand in our fleet across the country. Early results also indicate the seasonal holiday business will be a success given the early positive reaction to Halloween.\nIn the Williams-Sonoma brand, I want to highlight our recently announced change in leadership. Felix Carbullido, previously our Chief Marketing Officer, has assumed the role of President of the Williams-Sonoma brand. Felix brings incredible talent to the position through his experience in strategy and operations in addition to a breadth of merchandising, e-commerce and marketing expertise. Felix is only 3 weeks into the role, but sees clear opportunities for the brand, particularly in key areas, including: one, leaning further into the brand's heritage of inspiring those who love to cook at home with relevant and useful storytelling across all channels; two, the importance of offering the best product and ensuring customers can rely on Williams-Sonoma to be in stock across the key essentials of a great home kitchen. And finally, there are white space opportunities not only in our core offering, but also in new categories that have clear adjacencies to the kitchen.\nIn Q2, Williams-Sonoma came in at a positive 0.5% comp with accelerating comps throughout the quarter. This was driven by an improved in-stock position, newness in the assortment as well as higher conversion on the site driven by our ongoing e-commerce initiatives that improved imagery and shop path. In stock continues to improve, and we believe we will see further recovery in the back half.\nAs part of the Williams-Sonoma brand, our Williams-Sonoma Home business, we had a high double-digit comp again this quarter and continues to be an opportunity. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is destined to be a product leader of distinctive design-led, high-quality home furnishings.\nIn summary, we are proud of our performance and we remain committed to executing on our growth initiatives and operational improvements to drive market share gains and strong long-term financial returns. I want to thank our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We are committed to delivering for all of you.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie to go through all the financials in more detail.\n\nJulie P. Whalen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and hello, everyone.\nWe had another outstanding quarter with revenues, operating margin and earnings all exceeding expectations. Our performance and execution remains strong. Our comps outperformed due to positive and healthy demand comps and accelerating order fulfillment. Our growth strategy has continued to build momentum and our operating margin continued to grow above expectations due to running a more regular priced business and another quarter of advertising and employment leverage. These factors enabled us to outperform on both the top and bottom line with double-digit comps and another quarter of operating margin expansion. Our results this quarter further validate that we are one of the best positioned to succeed in the short and long term with strong profitable growth.\nMoving to our second quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew to $2.1 billion with comparable brand revenue growth at 11.3% on top of 29.8% last year for a 2-year stack of 41.1%. This includes double-digit growth in both channels. In retail, we delivered an 11.4% comp despite retail traffic down almost 19% in 2019. And in e-commerce, we delivered an 11.3% comp and grew our e-commerce penetration 60 basis points year-over-year to 65.4%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our gross margin continued to hold near historic highs at 43.5%, which was 60 basis points below last year's record Q2. Our merchandise margins remained strong with another consecutive quarter of merchandise margin expansion year-over-year as we continue to preserve our pricing integrity by remaining committed to our decision to no longer offer site-wide promotions. The gross margin decline was driven by higher freight costs from our strong furniture demand, higher back order fulfillment and global supply chain disruptions, driving freight rates higher for all.\nWe also incurred incremental freight costs in order to best serve our customers, to get product to them timely by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been done in a single shipment.\nOccupancy costs at 9% of net revenues were flat to last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 9.6% to approximately $193 million, which includes incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will allow us to support our ongoing growth, optimize service times for our customers and drive efficiencies in cost over time. And given our ongoing retail real estate optimization efforts, we were pleased that we were able to help mitigate these incremental costs and hold the occupancy rate flat.\nOur SG&A rate continues to be at a historical low at 26.4%, leveraging 90 basis points over last year, driven by advertising and employment leverage from our strong topline performance and ongoing operational efficiency. Across the company, we continue to operate with a disciplined approach, challenging all expenditures to maximize the return from our spend.\nThese results once again led to a record quarter of earnings with our most profitable Q2 ever, including operating income growth of 12% to $366 million, and an operating margin at 17.1%, expanding 40 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.87, up 19.4% from last year's record second quarter earnings per share of $3.24.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $125 million with no debt outstanding and year-to-date operating cash flow of $384 million. This year-to-date cash flow allowed us to fund the operations of the business and to almost double our capital investments to support our growth. In addition, we returned excess cash year-to-date of almost $880 million to shareholders, through $113 million in dividends and $766 million in share repurchases, a significant increase over last year at this time. These elevated share repurchase levels reflect the confidence we have in the long-term strength of our business and demonstrate our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns.\nMoving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, were $1.542 billion, increasing 32% over our reduced levels last year. Inventory on hand increased 28% over last year, but was only up 1% to 2019 versus sales up 56% over the same time frame. In the quarter, back order levels decreased. However, they continue to be too high in total. We are working hard to get these goods in to fulfill our customer orders. We believe that we will be able to return to normalized back order levels next year.\nTurning to our expectations for the remainder of the year and beyond. We are reiterating our fiscal year '22 and long-term financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, growing revenues to $10 billion by 2024 with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021. Our reiteration of our outlook simply acknowledges that the economic backdrop remains uncertain with currently unknown outcomes surrounding spending trends, inflation, interest rates, supply chain pressures and global unrest. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, evidenced by our first half outperformance and the accelerating demand comps we are seeing as we enter the third quarter.\nOur confidence to achieve our revenue outlook is rooted in 3 tangible drivers. Our year-to-date trends, which continue to outpace the industry and reflect market share gains, our continued improvement in our inventory receipts expected through the back half, which will enable us to fill prior orders and lower our elevated back order levels and our ongoing strength in our growth initiatives, which continue to build momentum.\nFrom a profitability perspective, we expect cost pressures to continue in the back half and into the beginning of 2023, particularly across our supply chain, from the incremental distribution centers and related costs to support our growth plus higher ocean freight and other freight-related costs resulting from the global supply chain disruptions and our efforts to best serve our customers by delivering product to them as timely as possible.\nDespite these pressures, we remain confident in our ability to achieve fiscal year operating margins relatively in line with our fiscal year '21 rate at 17.7%, which was an all-time high, given our strong start to the year and our culture of strong financial discipline.\nIn summary, we are very proud of the results we continue to deliver for our customers, associates and shareholders. These results further validate our ability to deliver sustainable strong growth and profitability. As we continue to navigate the dynamic changes in the macro environment, we are confident that our strong foundation of differentiators and our operating model as well as the momentum of our growth initiatives will continue to keep us ahead of the competition. And this, combined with an environment where consumers are shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing value and sustainability in their purchases now more than ever, leave us uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably.\nFinally, I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and relentlessness in driving these great results.\nI would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nSenior VP, CAO & Head of IR, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22 and our long-term outlook. Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimates and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\nAdditionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, along with an explanation of how and why we use these measures, appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier today. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual filings with the SEC.\nFinally, the call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone. We've been looking forward to this release. The first quarter of fiscal '22 represented another quarter of outperformance with a 9.5% comp on the top line with both demand and net sales in line with each other and 19.5% growth on the bottom line to $3.50 per share.\nThese results continue to demonstrate the strength of our multibrand portfolio and our team's ability to navigate challenges and outperform. These results are even more impressive when considering that we were up against last year's strong performance with a comp of more than 40%. We are confident in our annual guidance and longer-term goal of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 with growth across our core businesses and within our B2B, marketplace and global initiatives.\nUnderstanding our industry is key to putting our outstanding results in perspective. We operate in a large and fragmented industry that generates more than half of its sales from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have sophisticated e-commerce capabilities. We are one of the strongest market players, and we believe we have an opportunity to capture more of this $830 billion total addressable market. Our revenues in FY '21 of $8.2 billion represented just about 1% of the opportunity, and we continue to prove our ability to incrementally capture share.\nThe current economic environment is challenging, but the housing market remains strong. Hybrid work means people will continue to spend more time in their homes, and the rising costs related to gas and travel have historically led people to stay at home to cook and entertain. We believe that these 3 trends will result in continued momentum to outfit and improve the home. And as a company, we are prepared to manage through economic uncertainty. We are a multichannel portfolio of brands with a management team that has expertise and experience in managing through historical times of economic challenge.\nAnother large point of change in our industry is the movement of the consumer to purchase online. Further compounding this trend is the arrival of the millennial generation to the household creation stage. In an industry occupied by companies who are behind in developing their digital experiences and capabilities and pure plays that don't have experience running stores, we believe we are well positioned as a digital-first but not digital-only company.\nThese macro trends are perfectly aligned with our key differentiators. Our customers continue to look for us and turn to us for our exclusive, inspirational and high-quality products that we are able to value-engineer because of our in-house design capabilities. The benefits of our in-house design capabilities extend far beyond physical product design. We've also been able to design our own supply chain efficiencies and proprietary technology that allowed us -- has allowed our business to be resilient.\nOur channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both retail and marketplace-only players. And of course, our values, which are deeply rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, are embedded in our products and central in our actions. These principles will continue to be fundamental to our customers, who have shown us they will use their disposable income and purchasing power to support what is important to them. In fact, in a recent survey released in April, more than half of consumers said they're willing to pay a premium for sustainable products.\nAll of this, combined with our growth strategies, not only provide for sizable opportunities to grow our core business but also to drive momentum in reaching new customers, geographies and industries. This expansion and diversification of our customer base presents many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved markets.\nOur B2B business had its largest quarter ever, driving almost $250 million in demand and increasing 53% over last year. We are winning in the space by leaning into our best-in-class in-house product design capabilities to develop products specifically for large contract projects. This, along with the continued expansion of our client base is not only growing our book of business but also allowing us to focus on a wide breadth of client types and industry verticals.\nFor instance, in the hospitality industry, we continue to establish ourselves as a trusted partner in the large project space, including recent installs at Marriott's new headquarter hotel. In terms of B2B recognition, in April, we won an award for the Best Booth at the Hospitality Design Expo, which is North America's largest hospitality-focused trade show. Heading into Q2, this business has strong momentum and energy.\nTurning to marketing. We are pleased with the performance of our investments. This quarter, we delivered strong top line growth while leveraging our advertising spend. Key drivers of this efficiency include our proprietary in-house platform, which gives us the ability to identify customers who are in the market for home furnishings and ensures we are optimizing the spend per customer through our loyalty program and our cross-brand marketing.\nOn the digital front, during the quarter, we focused our efforts on 2 main areas: improving the conversion funnel throughout the customer journey and driving our AUR with enhanced product recommendation functionality and an improved furniture shopping experience.\nOn the sustainability front, our ESG leadership continues to distinguish our brands individually and our company as a whole. We are well on our way in our expanded cross-brand commitment to plant 6 million trees through 2023 in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation.\nAlso, we launched an internal award for sustainable innovation. It's called the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Good By Design Changemaker. This award celebrates associates doing great things across the company in sustainability. And we were recognized for the fifth year as a REPREVE Champion of Sustainability for the use of recycled materials.\nNow I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue our franchise-first strategy, focusing on both retail and digital execution. We are building our franchise presence in markets like the Middle East with 3 new stores opening in Dubai during the quarter and with more global stores coming in 2022.\nBefore we get into the brands, I want to take a minute to talk about the supply chain, where we continue to experience delays, challenges and additional costs across our network. We continue to navigate through challenging starts and stops from COVID-related pressures and shortages of raw materials and labor. Nonetheless, we are focused on meeting the expectations of our customers, and we are pleased that our customer satisfaction scores remain high and that we are beginning to see some improvement with in-stock inventory across our brands.\nAnd now let's turn to the performance of our brands that comprise our portfolio. Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a comp of 14.6% on top of 41.3% last year or 55.9% on a 2-year basis. All channels and product categories contributed to driving incremental demand. Our high-quality proprietary furniture business continues to lead the growth. We see strength across the business in core product, new offerings and our seasonal inventories.\nIn our stores, we see particular strength in our design services. As we move to Q2 and the summer season, we have further extended these services into outdoor spaces, and our newly remodeled stores continue to outperform expectations with a reimagined store design that has expanded the footprint for displaying lifestyle furniture in store.\nMoving to West Elm. West Elm delivered a 12.8% comp in the first quarter on top of 50.9% last year or 63.7% on a 2-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in furniture. Customers responded to new collections and line extensions and incremental sizes and aesthetics. Additionally, new categories such as kids and bath are also fueling incremental growth.\nLooking forward to Q2, we are particularly excited to launch our expanded B2B West Elm assortment and customer experience, specifically servicing the many small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. We are uniquely positioned to offer a broad assortment of full space, performance-led design solutions directly to these customers. This is an important initiative in our long-term strategy to capture additional growth to become a $3 billion brand.\nNow I'd like to update you on our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business. In our Q4 call, we talked about the challenges in our children's business driven by supply chain pressure out of Vietnam. This continued into Q1, and the brands ran a negative 3.1% comp. We have seen recovery in inventory in the business. However, our back orders remain at significant levels, and our back order rates -- our creation rates are still higher than last year. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect to see recovery in inventory levels in the back half.\nAlso impacted by out-of-stocks is our Williams-Sonoma brand with a fourth quarter comp of negative 2.2% following a 35.3% comp last year. Unfortunately, these out-of-stocks were in some key programs that had an outsized impact on our exclusive products. On a 3-year basis, on-hand inventories are down almost 40% in Williams-Sonoma on sales growth of 30%. We are focused on getting more in stock, and we believe we will see the recovery before Q4.\nAs part of the Williams-Sonoma brand, our Williams-Sonoma Home business ran a high double-digit comp this quarter and continues to be an opportunity. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is destined to be a product leader of distinctive, design-led, high-quality furnishing.\nAnd finally, let's not forget about our emerging brands, which include Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham. Together, these businesses ran a 31% comp this quarter, and they continue to outperform. We are confident in these brands and their ability to contribute to the long-term growth of our company. In fact, we believe Rejuvenation, which is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, has the potential to be our next $1 billion brand.\nIn summary, we are proud of our continued outperformance. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain confident and committed to our guidance of mid- to high single-digit comps with operating margins relatively aligned to fiscal '21. We have a solid lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for the balance of the year. And as we look further, we are confident in our path to be a $10 billion company by 2024.\nBefore I pass the call to Julie to go through the financials in more detail, I want to thank our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We are committed to delivering for all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie.\n\nJulie P. Whalen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial results with strong top line growth at record profitability levels, including revenue comps of 9.5%, operating margins expanding 120 basis points to 17.1% with gross margin expanding 80 basis points and EPS growing 19.5% to $3.50.\nOur results are even more impressive considering we were up against our strongest year-over-year compare, and we outperformed against the backdrop of ongoing macro volatility, including continued global supply chain pressures, rising inflation, increasing interest rates and the continued evolution of consumer spending in a post-pandemic world. Our results further validate the demand for our proprietary and sustainable products, the success of our growth strategies and the efficiencies of our operating model, highlighting why we believe we are best positioned to succeed in the short and long term with strong profitable growth.\nMoving to our first quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew to nearly $1.9 billion with comparable brand revenue growth at 9.5%, which was in line with our demand comp. And this growth was on top of a 40.4% comp last year for a 2-year stack of 50%. These strong top line results actualized in both channels, including retail at a 14.4% comp, which was an 82.1% 2-year stack despite retail traffic still negative 20% to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And in e-commerce, we delivered a 7.3% comp on top of a 30.6% comp last year, maintaining our e-commerce mix as a percent of total revenues at 65%.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at a record 43.8%, an 80 basis point expansion over last year, driven primarily by the strength of our merchandise margins where we're able to continue to preserve our pricing integrity without utilizing site-wide promotions. The demand for our full-priced products once again allowed us to more than offset higher product and freight costs while still delivering record margins and strong top line sales.\nOccupancy costs came in at 9.9% of net revenues and leveraged 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy dollars increased 6.1% to approximately $186 million, which includes the incremental costs from our new East Coast distribution center to support our strong customer demand as well as higher depreciation costs primarily from our capital expenditures to support our e-commerce business. All of this was partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization actions. The occupancy benefits we are seeing from our rent renegotiations and the incremental net closure of 37 stores at the end of 2021 has enabled us to minimize occupancy dollar growth and deliver this leverage.\nOur SG&A rate was a first quarter low of 26.7%, leveraging 40 basis points over last year, driven primarily by employment and advertising. This leverage was a function of our strong top line performance and operational efficiencies, holding our payroll costs, advertising and general expense growth below sales growth. We are proud of the disciplined culture we have built, which demands efficiency and returns from our spend.\nThese results led to our most profitable Q1 ever with operating income growth of 16% to $323 million and an operating margin at 17.1%, our highest non-holiday quarter ever, expanding 120 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.50, up 19.5% from last year's record first quarter earnings per share of $2.93.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $325 million and no debt outstanding. Our strong liquidity and operating cash flow of almost $185 million during the quarter allowed us to not only fund the operations of the business but to also invest in the business at higher year-over-year levels in the form of $71 million in capital expenditures to pay incremental dividends increasing to over $58 million in the quarter and to repurchase a record $500 million in shares, a 60% year-over-year first quarter increase off of a prior year high.\nThese decisions reflect our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. And with our strong and disciplined balance sheet, combined with our expected cash flow strength and our remaining over $1 billion share repurchase authorization, this allows us the flexibility to continue to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term shareholder returns.\nMoving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, were $1,396,000,000, increasing 28.4% over depressed levels last year. Inventory on hand increased 17.7% over last year. And our units were only up 1% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the mix shift to higher AUR furniture inventory. And on a 3-year basis, our on-hand inventory was down nearly 7% to 2019 pre-pandemic levels as compared to sales that have grown over 50% over the same time frame.\nAs a result, given our ongoing higher sales volumes, our continued elevated back order levels and the significant macro supply chain disruptions we are still experiencing, we are still below optimal levels, particularly in our best-selling back-ordered items. And we expect this to continue into the back half of 2022.\nNow let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and beyond. We remain optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business. As a result, we are reiterating our financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins relatively in line with 2021. We are confident in our ability to deliver our revenue outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the momentum in our growth initiatives such as B2B and our expected sequential improvement in our in-stock inventory levels, enabling us to fill our significant back orders and recognize net revenue and potentially at a higher comp than demand even if demand were to soften as we move throughout the year.\nFrom a profitability perspective, we remain confident in our ability to hold our operating margins relatively in line with 2021 despite expected ongoing cost pressures. Like everyone else, we are experiencing higher product costs and supply chain-related costs, including higher freight, and incremental distribution center costs for additional space to support our overall growth and our ongoing mix shift to furniture that is a larger cube.\nWe are also experiencing higher costs to best serve our customers to get product to them as timely as possible by shipping product from out-of-market distribution centers. And for multiunit orders, we are shipping multiple times to the same customer, which typically would have all been done in one shipment * and an incremental cost to us.\nHowever, because of the power of our operating model, we believe we are best positioned to mitigate these costs in both the short and long term, whether it is the leverage from our higher sales on our path to $10 billion; the accelerating expansion of our highly accretive growth initiatives such as B2B; the growth of our e-commerce business, which operates at a higher margin profile; our strong merchandise margins from the pricing power our proprietary and vertically integrated products provide; our retail optimization efforts, reducing rents and other efficiencies to drive margins more in line with e-commerce; various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels over time; and our continued emphasis on strong financial discipline.\nWe continue to believe the combination of all of these opportunities provides several levers we can utilize to drive incremental earnings to offset higher costs. And this is what gives us the confidence to hold our operating margins relatively in line with last year.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our outperformance this quarter. These results further validate that our key differentiators, our incremental growth strategies and our proven operational execution, combined with an environment where consumers are investing more in their homes, are shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing value and sustainability in their purchases now more than ever before, leave us uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably in this evolving macro environment.\nAnd this, combined with our strong operating cash flow and liquidity, our operational levers that enable us to help mitigate incremental costs, along with a proven track record of strong financial discipline and a tenured management team with a winning culture, give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 with operating margins relatively in line with last year and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders.\nFinally, I would like to thank our associates for all that they do to make our company great. The commitment, creativity and integrity of our talent is the backbone for the results we continue to deliver.\nAnd now I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Brooks\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal '21 earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22 and our long-term outlook.

This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual filings with the SEC.\nFinally, the call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLaura J. Alber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We're thrilled to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2021, driving record results with a Q4 comp of 10.8% and operating margin expansion of 310 basis points. These results reflect the resilience in our business model as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges within the supply chain, material and labor shortages and capacity limitations from our incredible consumer demand. This resilience, coupled with continued execution in our growth initiatives fueled an annual comp of 22%, operating margin expansion of 350 basis points and EPS growth of 64% to $14.85 per share.\nOur 3 key differentiators are in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values continue to provide the framework for execution, both in our core business and in our growth areas like B2B, Marketplace, cross brands and our global business, which excitingly have all gained traction faster than predicted and demonstrate to us that we are well positioned to continue to take share in this industry.\nFirst, let's spend some time on our top line performance in the fourth quarter. Throughout fiscal 2021, we continued a deliberate reduction in our site-wide promotional cadence in all of our brands. Instead, we shifted our focus on delivering aspirational and inspirational content, and our customers clearly responded. This pricing power is entirely a function of our differentiated and sustainable product offering that our customers know and love. And further, despite the highly promotional environment in the fourth quarter, we made a conscious decision to maintain this pricing integrity and not pursue incremental top line at the cost of our merchandise margins. In fact, we delivered gross margin expansion of 290 basis points in the quarter. Further, this pricing power has allowed us the flexibility to absorb supply chain costs and aggressively fund marketing efforts.\nOur bottom line performance in the fourth quarter speaks for itself. We drove operating margin of 21% and a 37% increase in EPS, both of which demonstrate the durability of our earnings power through execution in our core and growth initiatives, which I'm excited to update you on now. Our B2B business continues to outperform, building its book of business to $753 million in 2021. B2B is an underserved and fractured industry. As we continue to take share in this white space, servicing businesses that need high-quality, sustainable furnishings at good price points. Furthermore, our in-house design capabilities offering the wide breadth of aesthetics across our brands, coupled with our industry-leading global sourcing and supply chain operations allows us to take this service to the next level. Our B2B business has tremendous potential to contribute to our results. Our growth targets continue to climb as we unlock new opportunities. And not only is our B2B business model accretive to our gross margin, but even more accretive to op margin as a result of its fixed operating costs. We continue to exceed our own expectations for this business. And longer term, we believe this is one of our biggest opportunities.\nAnother contributor to our success has been our global strategy. We're franchise first with strong retail and digital execution. During 2021, global achieved record revenue up 23% over last year with strong earnings growth. Core company-owned markets of Canada and U.K. achieved record results for the year and the quarter. Franchise continues to be a growth vehicle with the critical markets of the Middle East, Mexico and India providing a large diverse growth base. With our systems investment in our new digital platform and large cost reductions in warehousing, transportation and delivery, we expect to exceed our record results in 2022.\nMarketing is another component that sets us apart and drove results in FY '21. Customers who shop across our brands generate 3 to 4x more revenue than the single brand customer. And we've seen incredible results this past year due to our continued marketing efforts. In fiscal '21, approximately 60% of our sales came from cross-brand customers, a record high in terms of percent to total. And our cross-brand customer counts grew faster than those of the single-brand customer. While new customer acquisition is always a priority and continues to grow, we believe we have even more upside by increasing our share of wallet with our existing customer base. Core to this strategy are 3 things: first, our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key, we continue to see record levels of customer engagement and an all-time high membership; second, our recently launched cross-brand credit card, this card reached its 6-month anniversary, producing cardholder spend and cross-brand activity that has exceeded our expectations; and third, we are focused on personalization efforts in our digital marketing. We continue to leverage our in-house managed first-party data across our brands, which positions us for the cookie-less future that is rapidly approaching. Remember, our multifaceted loyalty program generates benefits across our portfolio and is a clear competitive advantage a few of our peers offer.\nAs a digital-first company, we are in constant pursuit of incremental improvement to our customers' shopping journey online. We've improved several product finding and purchasing experiences on our website, from improved room styling, native registry applications and the removal of friction in the checkout process. Additionally, we relentlessly focus on continued optimization and automation in our DCs and logistics networks to improve our service time.\nOn the sustainability front, we take great pride in the progress we are making with our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishings industry. Notable accomplishments in this quarter included our second annual inclusion in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index, being recognized as #21 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and receiving an A rating from CDP for leadership in supplier engagement and our work with suppliers on tackling climate change. These commitments are reflected in the high-quality sustainable products that we offer our customers and continue to distinguish our company and our brands.\nOur values are both central in our actions and embedded in our products. We always want to provide our customers with transparency. And each day, we commit ourselves to maintaining the highest level of integrity and ethical standards. We are deeply saddened by the war in Ukraine and we stand with Ukrainians and all people who oppose war and its atrocities on family and the home. Related to product and business with Russia, we have no operations in Russia. And as the situation between Russia and Ukraine escalated, our team identified a handful of products of Russian origin, which we are no longer selling.\nAnd now let's turn to the performance of our brands. West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp in the fourth quarter with all categories driving strong growth. Customers responded well to new products, including bestsellers in bedroom, dining, storage and occasional categories. Additionally, new categories such as bath, kids and kitchen also contributed to incremental growth. On the full year, West Elm delivered a comp of 33.1%, building to a 48.3% on a 2-year basis and continuing to build velocity in its mission to become a $3 billion brand.\nPottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a 16.2% comp, driven by strong core franchises in key categories. Q4 results were enhanced by a strong seasonal decorating business and inspiring seasonal bedding and entertaining. On the full year, Pottery Barn celebrated a record year with a comp of 23.9%, building to a 39.1% on a 2-year basis. Also, we're delighted to report that Pottery Barn has surpassed the halfway mark on its commitment to plant 3 million trees in 3 years to restore vulnerable forests. Our partner, Arbor Foundation, follows the best practices and the latest science to ensure maximum impact and promote biodiversity. And even better, based on the tremendous success of this program, our other brands have joined the effort, doubling our commitment to planting 6 million trees by 2023. We couple this with commitments to responsibly harvest wood and a robust sustainability story.\nNow I'd like to talk about Pottery Barn kids and teen. As we indicated during our third quarter call, we were not entirely immune to the ripple effect from delays resulting from the supply chain disruption around the world. In particular, the shutdown in related backlogs from Vietnam had a larger impact on our children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 6.1 comp for the quarter. Unfortunately, we expect to feel this impact at least through the second quarter of this year. Despite the supply chain pressure, strength in the business includes our baby business, which is delivering growth through our offering of green, guard, gold furniture, along with additional volume from our in-store and online baby registry.\nAlso we delivered record results in our seasonal trim business as customers enjoy the holidays. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen delivered a full year comp of 11.6%, building to a 28.2% on a 2-year basis.\nOur Williams-Sonoma business drove a fourth quarter comp of 4.5% on top of a 26.2% comp last year, with growth driven by demand for entertaining at home and gift giving. We continue to focus our strategy on expanding our exclusive product and Williams-Sonoma branded product to drive growth. We are pleased with improvements in the digital experience on the website that are driving conversion and our store optimization strategy is working. Our high-impact store remodels and our market consolidation efforts are driving improved operating margins. On the full year, Williams-Sonoma delivered a comp of 10.5%, building to a 34.3% on a 2-year basis.\nOne of our key components of growth is our Williams-Sonoma Home business. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is one of our biggest growth opportunities.\nIn summary, we're immensely proud of our accomplishments and record results this fiscal year. I am confident that we will continue to raise the bar and extend this momentum in fiscal 2022. So far, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales and margins. We have a robust lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for this year. And as we look further, we are confident in our long-term outlook, driving at least mid- to high single-digit comps with top line growth to $10 billion by 2024 and operating margins relatively in line with fiscal 2021.\nBefore I pass the call to Julie to go through the financials in more detail, I want to thank our entire team for never slowing down. I'm endlessly grateful for their outstanding work, their creative energy and their relentless focus. I am privileged to work alongside this talented group of people.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie.\n\nJulie P. Whalen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter and fiscal year of outstanding financial results with revenues and profits at the highest levels we have seen. The demand for our proprietary products remains strong. Our growth strategies continue to thrive. Our operating model, which is difficult to replicate, continues to set us apart from the competition. And all of these, plus our proven ability to dynamically operate in a complex macro environment, continues to demonstrate that we are well positioned to succeed long term in this industry.\nMoving to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Net revenues surpassed $2.5 billion with another quarter of double-digit comparable brand revenue growth at 10.8%. These strong top line results were across both channels, including retail at a 20% comp and e-commerce at a 7.2% comp on top of last year's 47.9% for a 55.1% 2-year stack.\nBy brand, West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp on top of 25.2% last year. Pottery Barn accelerated from the third quarter to a 16.2% comp. Williams-Sonoma drove a 4.5% comp on top of last year's 26.2%. And our emerging brands accelerated to a 30.3% comp.\nIn the children's home furnishings businesses, Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, comps were a negative 6.1%. This is below their third quarter year-to-date trend of approximately 20% as these brands were the most impacted during the fourth quarter by the supply chain issues from the COVID-related closure of Vietnam.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at a record 45.0%, a 290 basis point expansion over last year. The strength of our merchandise margins drove almost all or 270 basis points of this expansion. Our strategic decision to preserve our pricing integrity by eliminating site-wide promotions was once again a clear success. This pricing power enabled us to absorb increased freight and product costs, while still delivering strong, profitable merchandise sales.\nOccupancy costs at 7.7% of net revenues leveraged approximately 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy dollars increased 6.7% to approximately $193 million, which includes a full quarter of incremental costs from our new east coast distribution center to further support our customer demand, partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization efforts from additional store closures and reduced rent.\nIn fiscal year '21, we closed an additional 37 stores and are on track to close approximately 25% of our total retail fleet. SG&A, also leveraged 20 basis points, to a historical low of 24% despite absorbing higher year-over-year advertising costs from our reduced spend last year. Leverage was driven by employment and general expenses, which includes lower incentive compensation during the quarter due to timing and the year-over-year benefit from our ongoing retail recovery, various operational efficiencies during the holiday season and overall strong financial discipline throughout. As a result, we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 28% to $525 million, and our highest ever operating margin at 21%, expanding 310 basis points over last year and approximately 500 basis points higher than our last 3 quarters this year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $5.42, up 37% from last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $3.95. These fourth quarter results, combined with our outperformance we have seen throughout 2021, allowed us to deliver another year of substantial growth and outperformance.\nOn the top line, these full year highlights include: an additional $1.5 billion in net revenues, growing to over $8.2 billion, including comparable brand revenue growth of 22% on top of last year's 17% or a 39% 2-year stack. E-commerce growing to a 14.3% comp and a 58.8% 2-year comp with our e-commerce mix at 66% of total revenues.\nRetail growing at a 43.2% comp despite traffic levels at negative 16% to 2019. A second consecutive year of double-digit growth across all brands with significant acceleration across our 2 largest brands, with West Elm at a 33.1% comp, Pottery Barn at a 23.9% comp, Williams-Sonoma at a 10.5% comp on top of last year's 23.8%. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivering another year of accelerating double-digit growth. Our global business growing 23% to over $425 million and our cross-brand initiatives outperforming with our business-to-business division growing 109% to over $750 million in demand and contributing approximately 500 basis points to our total company comp.\nOn the bottom line, this top line strength and strong financial discipline throughout enabled us to grow 2021 operating income to $1.5 billion, over $0.5 billion and 52% higher than last year. Operating margin at 17.7% on the year expanded 350 basis points over last year, and was more than 2x higher than our 2019 and prior operating margin levels. This was driven by gross margins expanding to record levels or 500 basis points above last year to 44%, despite increased costs associated with supply chain disruptions throughout the year. This operating income strength resulted in EPS of $14.85, which was $5.81 or 64% above last year and drove our return on invested capital to an all-time high at 57.9%.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the year with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $850 million and no debt or amounts outstanding on our line of credit. The strength of our business generated operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2021, which has allowed us to fund the operations of the business, to invest over $225 million in capital expenditures, primarily in technology and supply chain and to return nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders in the form of $188 million in dividends and 900 million in share repurchases. These decisions reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our growth and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\nMoving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.246 billion, increasing 24% over last year, which includes inventory in transit. Inventory on hand increased 14.8%, but was still negative 13% on a 2-year basis. Given the significant macro supply chain disruptions throughout the year and the ongoing strong customer demand, we are still below optimal levels. As a result, we expect to see elevated back order levels continue until the back half of 2022.\nNow let me turn to our expectations for the future. As Laura said, we remain very optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business. Our business remains strong as we enter Q1 with momentum in our core businesses and our growth initiatives continuing. As a result, for both fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we are reiterating our previously provided financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit comp growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021. We estimate revenues will reach $10 billion by fiscal year 2024, with our brands accelerating or reaching our prior committed targets faster, including Pottery Barn expanding to $3.5 billion in revenues; West Elm, adding $1 billion in revenues to over $3.3 billion; Williams-Sonoma will reach almost $1.6 billion in revenues, and our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen businesses will grow to $1.4 billion. This expected top line growth will also be fueled by growth across our strategic initiatives, such as our B2B business doubling to $1.5 billion in revenues.\nOur Marketplace business growing 20% annually to nearly $700 million. Our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over $600 million and our global operations continuing to expand in size to $700 million. And we are confident we can drive this top line growth profitably, due to leverage across the P&L from ongoing higher sales growth, additional accretion from our accelerating growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin profile, an accelerating shift online where the operating margin is higher. Strong merchandise margins from the pricing power are proprietary and vertically integrated products provide, continued occupancy leverage from further store closures and reduced rents.\nVarious long-term supply chain efficiencies, such as automation and better in-stock inventory levels and leverage from overall strong financial discipline throughout, keeping expense growth below sales growth. Our capital allocation plans for 2022 will continue to first prioritize investments into the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders.\nWe expect to invest approximately $350 million in the business. with over 80% of the spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives, primarily to support e-commerce, including the addition of a new automated distribution center in Arizona. We also expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and elevated share repurchases.\nFor dividends, we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend, up 10% or $0.07 to $0.78 per share. We also announced our Board has approved a new share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, which will replace the remaining amount outstanding under our prior authorization. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. This new authorization will allow us the flexibility to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term financial returns.\nAs we begin our next fiscal year, our focus remains on executing against our opportunities to drive long-term elevated top and bottom line growth. We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably. Long-term macro trends should continue to favor our business, including a strong housing market driving ongoing investment in the home, an accelerating shift to e-commerce and the increasing importance to the consumer of sustainability and being a values-driven company. And this, combined with our accelerating growth initiatives, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline, give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders.\nI would now like to also thank all of our associates and business partners for all that they do for our company. It is their ongoing commitment that has enabled us to deliver another year of financial outperformance and to reward all of our stakeholders.\nI would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

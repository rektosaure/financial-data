Discovery Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may now begin.\n\nAndrew T. Slabin\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our Q3 earnings call. Joining me today from Warner Bros. Discovery's management is David Zaslav, President and Chief Executive Officer; [indiscernible], Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games.\nThis morning, we issued our Q3 earnings release, shareholder letter and trending schedule, and these materials can be found on our website at www.wbd.com.\nToday's presentation will include forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements may include statements about the benefits of the separation transaction we announced in June, including future financial and operating results; the separate company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations from Warner Bros. Discovery's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For additional information on factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. I will turn the call over to David for some brief remarks, after which we will take your questions.\nThough before doing so, I would kindly request that analysts limit their questions to topics related to our Q3 results in related business and financial topics. As noted in our shareholder letter, management will not be taking questions regarding our recent announcement of the Board's evaluation of strategic alternatives for Warner Bros. discovery. And with that, I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. When we formed Warner Bros. Discovery in April of 2022, 3.5 years ago. Our focus was on taking an incredible foundation of assets, world-class production capabilities, a century's worth of beloved storytelling franchises and IP and a roster of some of the most iconic brands in media and build them back up and transform Warner Bros. Discovery to thrive and win in the modern entertainment business. We built a creative culture that's attracting the best talent and Warner Bros. Discovery is now where creatives want to be.\nTransforming and rebuilding Warner Bros. Discovery has been hard work. It has taken time and investment and the process has not been without setbacks. But as you could see from our third quarter results, we're delivering on our promise and Warner Bros. Discovery is back, global and stronger than ever.\nAs we've said consistently, our transformation and rebuild has been guided by 3 principles: First, returning our studios to industry leadership. When we brought Warner Bros. Discovery together, our Motion Picture Group had half a dozen or fewer movies on its slate and was stuck in last place. We were determined to invest in the motion picture business and to rebuild and regain our place as the leading motion picture studio. 3.5 years later, we're there. Right now, we're leading the 2025 box office domestically, we're leading it internationally, and we're leading it globally. Not only are we in first place, but we are the only film studio to have crossed $4 billion in 2025 box office revenue thus far. And we've done it with a significant amount of original stories.\nThat leadership was on full display in the third quarter. In Q3 alone, we successfully launched a new era for the DC Studios, Superman. We showed our exceptional [indiscernible] genre expertise yet again, with weapons and the conjuring last rights, which have together grossed more than $750 million in ticket sales. And we reinforced our commitment to producing great original works by great filmmakers with Paul Thomas Anderson's 1 battle After Another. As we look ahead, '26 and '27 will be a robust and strong slate of motion pictures. I'm excited to announce that we are adding a new Gremlins film that will be released in theaters on November 19, 2027. Steven Spielberg returns to executive produce or Amblin Entertainment, and Chris Columbus is coming back to both direct and produce.\nWe're also leading the industry in making television. Warner Bros. Television was recently recognized with 14 Emmy awards, including outstanding drama series for the Pit, and 9 Emmy wins for the Penguin. And WBTV remains Hollywood's leading supplier of television to both streaming and network platforms.\nBased on our results to date, we expect our studios to meaningfully exceed $2.4 billion in EBITDA this year, and we are making strong progress towards our $3 billion EBITDA goal. Our second guiding principle has been to scale HBO Max globally. 4 years ago, HBO Max was a subscale streaming service that was primarily available in the U.S. We had a vision for HBO to be a global offering with broader and more local content, including sports in some regions, and that HBO could serve as a long-term profit engine. We are committed to that global vision.\nToday, HBO Max is available in more than 100 countries. We've added more than 30 million new streaming subscribers in 3 years. Our streaming segment will contribute more than $1.3 billion in EBITDA to our bottom line this year versus losing $2.5 billion 3 years ago. And we still have launches in some of the biggest markets in the world, like Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Ireland coming in 2026.\nBy the end of next year, we will have more than 150 million total streaming subscribers. We're delivering those results by investing hard and continuing to distinguish our offering through quality. I said in the beginning of this journey, it's not how much, it's how good. And that belief continues to guide everything we do.\nHBO really embodies that standard. And Casey and the team have done a superb job. Our successes earlier in the year with series like The Pit, Write Lotus and The Last of Us, carried forward into Q3 with shows like TASC and Gilded Age, both of which have averaged more than 10 million viewers per episode. HBO was recognized with 30 Emmy Awards this summer tied for the most of any network or platform. Just recently, HBO debuted It, Welcome to Dairy, to a resounding audience response. The series premiere was the third most watched in HBO history behind only The Last of Us and House of the Dragon, and has been watched by almost 15 million viewers in its first week. This is further evidence that in its long history, HBO has never delivered a steadier, more consistent pipeline of titles that subscribers circle in their calendars to watch.\nIn Q3, we also saw movies like Sinners, Final Destination Bloodlines and Superman arrive on HBO Max and drive strong engagement, with Weapons Now also available and The Conjuring Last Rights and One Battle After Another on their way in Q4, and we will end 2025 with more Warner Bros. Pay1 movies in HBO Max's top 20 titles than ever before.\nAfter years of development, the balance of content we envision for HBO Max with Warner Bros. extensive TV library, HBO Original Series and Warner Bros. Pay 1 movies, a 1, 2, 3 combination that's very powerful. It has finally come into full form. The value proposition for subscribers is only growing stronger. Having rebuilt Warner Bros. to the #1 studio in the world is proving to be a big win, not just in the box office but across HBO Max, where our great films are driving record engagement and growth globally, well after its theatrical window.\nFinally, our third principle has been to optimize our linear networks. The headwinds facing the linear television business are well understood. But for all that's been said about the disruption confronting these businesses, not enough has been said about their resilience. Networks like TNT, TBS, CNN, Discovery, TLC and HGTV, Food Network and many others continue to be indispensable to tens of millions of subscribers worldwide, which is why our networks remain such a powerful cash flow contributor.\nAs our global networks investment is extending their brands digitally, we see a long and profitable runway ahead. Through it all, we've also dramatically reduced our debt, with our net leverage ratio now down to 3.3x our EBITDA, including paying down $1 billion from our bridge loan facility in the third quarter. Thanks to the work we've done, we're on track to create 2 strong, well-capitalized businesses that can each create significant long-term shareholder value. The team is hard at work, both on the separation transaction and on following the Board's direction to evaluate strategic alternatives.\nYou've all seen media reports as to potential interested parties, and I won't comment on anything specific. But it's fair to say that we have an active process underway.\nWhen you look at our films like Superman, Weapons and One Battle After Another, the global reach of HBO Max and the diversity of our networks offerings, we've managed to bring the best, most treasured traditions of Warner Bros. forward into a new era of entertainment and new media landscape. I'm thrilled with our progress in Q3 and welcome your questions.",

Discovery Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. You may now begin.\n\nAndrew T. Slabin\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 earnings call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games.\nToday's presentation will include forward-looking statements that we made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements may include comments regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For additional information on factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this call.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest can be found in our earnings release and in our trending schedules, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. Our top strategic objectives have always been clear to be the premier home for the world's most creative talent both in front of and behind the camera, to operate as the world's largest, highest-quality maker and producer of film and television. And to distribute those stories to audiences worldwide through a globally scaled, profitable streaming service.\nIn the second quarter and in the early weeks of the third quarter, Warner Bros. led with strong momentum in delivering on all 3 of those objectives. We're seeing that momentum at motion pictures, where Warner Bros. became the first studio ever to open 5 consecutive films with more than $45 million in domestic box office. We're seeing that at the Emmys, where Warner Bros. TV led all studios in nominations and HBO set a new record with 142 nominations. We're seeing it in the strong critical and fan response to Superman. Which begins an exciting new era for DC Studios, and we're thrilled to share that James Gun is already writing and preparing to direct the next installment within the Super family.\nAnd we're seeing it at HBO Max, which again added more than 3.4 million subscribers in Q2 as it continues to launch in markets around the world. This pattern of creative success is the result of a 3-plus year attack plan aimed at enhancing every dimension of our creative culture and storytelling business. From HBO to Warner Bros. Television to Warner Bros. Pictures, and from animation to DC Studios, we've invested in our studios creative and operational capabilities. As a result, our Studios business is now on track to deliver at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2025 with our site set on our $3 billion goal.\nWe have transformed HBO Max and have our streaming business on track to exceed $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and reach over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026 and from CNN to TNT Sports, we are bringing innovation to news, sports and unscripted programming as we work to optimize our global networks. All the while, we've dramatically delevered our balance sheet from over 5x net leverage to 3.3x now, the lowest since our merger closed. As we continue to navigate generational disruption and move forward with splitting into 2 independent publicly traded companies in 2026. Our current momentum will help position both future organizations for long-term success. With that, we look forward to your questions.",

Zaslav\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Two years ago, we said it's not how much, it's how good. And today, that focus on quality is really paying off. It's our commitment to high-quality storytelling powered by the most exceptional creative talents in front of and behind the camera, continues to be the engine that powers Warner Bros. Discovery.\nThat engine has never been stronger, more differentiated and more important, both here in the U.S. and around the world. Whether it's the White Lotus, The Pitt, The Last of Us, Minecraft movie, Sinners or the Eastern Gate series internationally, when you look at what's shaping culture today, so much is coming from our studios and reaching audiences on our platforms.\nThese stories aren't just watched, but savored. People immerse themselves in them, share them and return to them. They spark conversation, drive connection and fuel fandom. And that cultural influence and strength is showing up in our bottom line.\nOn streaming, as you saw in our letter, we delivered another exceptionally strong quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have gained more than 22 million subscribers. And in the first quarter, we gained over 5 million subscribers and delivered $339 million in EBITDA. We are firmly on track to deliver at least $1.3 billion of EBITDA in 2025, up 85% versus 2024, and to surpass our 150 million subscriber goal by the end of next year.\nWhat's fueling that success? It's multiple growth levers that provide years of opportunity still ahead. Starting with the best stories from HBO, which is delivering the deepest, most consistent storytelling pipeline in its history. It's local language content and local sports that bolster our relevance in every region in the world. That combination makes us really unique.\nThe impact of our stories is then amplified by our increasingly global footprint that still has almost half the world to go. And it's brought to life by a product that has gotten better at enhancing personalization and engagement, but still has a strong road map of improvements ahead.\nOn Studios, we are also encouraged by the progress in getting back to our $3 billion in EBITDA goal and growing. That's coming from the strength of Warner Bros. Television, the world's leading independent TV studio, which broadens our cultural and commercial impact onto platforms outside of WBD ecosystem with standout shows.\nIt's also coming from Warner Bros. Motion Pictures, where our strategy of a mix of IP-based blockbusters and compelling new originals is gaining traction and delivering results, as demonstrated by the recent big success of a Minecraft movie and Sinners. And Final Destination, which is launching next week, is trending very strong.\nLooking ahead, we are excited about the strong slate across all of our studios, starting with DC Studio's launching Superman in July. We're wrapping on Super Girl and are deep into production on Lanterns, all part of our 10-year plan to reignite the DC brand globally and drive long-term franchise value.\nWhat we have now is a powerful combination of a differentiated, profitable and growing global streaming service with a world-class studio business, both being supplemented by the meaningful continued cash generation from our global linear networks.\nWarner Bros. Discovery's global reach, growth and the demand for our quality content offerings gives us real confidence in our ability to create long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value.\nWith that, we welcome your questions.",

Discovery's Q4 Earnings Call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games.\nEarlier this morning, we released our Q4 earnings results, trending schedule, as well as accompanying shareholder letter. We will begin this morning with some very brief remarks by David and then turn the call right to Q&A.\nToday's presentation will include forward-looking statements that we made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Zaslav\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\n2.5 years ago, when we brought Warner Bros. Discovery together, our vision was to combine Discovery's leading position as a global force in media and entertainment with local content and local sports, alongside the iconic storytelling brands, IP and libraries of Warner Bros. and HBO. This powerful combination is a unique, compelling offering that we believe would resonate with consumers worldwide.\nIt was the strategic guts of our transaction. Our direct-to-consumer business ended 2024 with about 117 million subscribers across more than 70 countries, and we still have nearly half the world to go, with many key markets, like the U.K., Italy, Germany and Australia, launching over the next few years.\nWe added about 6.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter and nearly 20 million subscribers in less than a year. Max continues to grow at a powerful pace, and we expect it to continue throughout 2025 and beyond.\nIn this generational media disruption, only the global streamers will survive and prosper, and Max is just that. With the launch of Max internationally in 2024, we now have a global subscription business that is growing subs, revenue and EBITDA. We have a clear demonstrable path to at least 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026, fueling further revenue and EBITDA growth.\nMax is one of the world's very few global and profitable streaming services. Our direct-to-consumer business contributed almost $700 million in EBITDA, a $3 billion improvement in just 2 years, and we expect direct-to-consumer EBITDA to nearly double in 2025.\nAs I mentioned in our last earnings call, we are laser-focused on getting our Studios back to a place of industry leadership and generating $3 billion or more in EBITDA. We are showing growth and real strength in our Warner Bros. television business, which I believe is the highest quality and largest maker of TV content in the world.\nWe are excited about our Studios' creative and financial outlook this year and beyond, particularly all that's coming from Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Studios, kicking off with the release of Superman this July.\nDespite the headwinds facing linear television, we recently struck a flurry of multiyear renewal agreements with 5 of the 6 largest ATV providers in America, many of which were a year early and all of which commanded overall rate increases. These long-term deals provide real security and stability to our linear business.\nFinally, we have been hard at work and have made real progress implementing the reorganization we announced in December, which went into effect on January 1. This new structure will provide investors with better visibility to the strength of our streaming and Studios business, and will give us real strategic value and optionality into the future.\n2024 marked a year of significant progress in transforming Warner Bros. Discovery, laying the foundation for what's next and positioning us as a global media leader committed to providing shareholders with sustainable future growth. We remain fully focused on enhancing shareholder value and welcome your questions.",

Zaslav\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This has been a busy, productive quarter, albeit against the backdrop of what continues to be tough market conditions. 2-plus years after launching our company, we are still in the midst of a long-term transition marked by many notable progress points as well as some tough challenges.\nOur direct-to-consumer business is doing very, very well, and we see a tremendous amount of upside. At the same time, there were tough conditions in the legacy business. With that as a frame, let me walk you through some of the highlights.\nOn the direct-to-consumer side, at the home of the Olympics in Europe, Max and discovery+ are the only place to watch virtually every minute of the Olympic Games, and it's really worked for us. It's been a multi-platform experience spanning linear, digital, social and streaming with more than 141 million people engaged across our channels and platforms. We purposely timed the launch of Max in Europe to capitalize on the attention around the Olympics. It was a heavy lift and it paid off. We broadcast the games on Max and discovery+ on linear TV and online through our Eurosport channels, to 47 markets in 20 different languages.\nA challenging endeavor by any measure and yet the team at our broadcast center in the heart of Paris has made it look easy. More importantly, the response from consumers since the start of the games has exceeded our highest expectations, both in terms of subscriber growth and viewership. The success of the Olympics and our whole offering reflects an incredible amount of work over the last 2 years, fighting to make our content available outside the U.S. And now we are finally there in Latin America and in Europe.\nWe are now a global streaming service and one of the strongest international media companies in the world. It's an important and strategic advantage. With films, series, local content, local sports and the very best original entertainment in markets around the world, which is an absolute requisite for a successful direct-to-consumer business.\nI am convinced that to be successful, you have to be global. It's a core belief, I had a discovery, and our global attack plan at discovery was what fueled the majority of our shareholder value creation there. And now after 18 months of rebuilding our product and platform at Max, refocusing our proposition and brand, restructuring our cost and reloading our content arsenal. We're beginning to really scale and grow the service worldwide, and momentum is building.\nWe are only just beginning to unlock the global value opportunity that exists. We added 2 million subscribers sequentially in the first quarter and more than 3.6 million subscribers in the second quarter. And it's worth noting that we began launching in Europe in the middle of the quarter with only 2 weeks of House of the Dragon and before the Olympics had even kicked off. And we'll see even greater subscriber growth this quarter.\nMeanwhile, we've scaled the platform while driving increased revenue. We have lots of runway still ahead and real momentum. Our big advantage is our channels, infrastructure and local teams in almost every market that can now all row together to promote our SVOD service. Max is finally in 65 international markets and yet still not present in almost half the global addressable markets, including sizable streaming markets where our content and franchises have significant fan bases like Australia, Japan, the U.K., Germany and Italy. We intend to continue our drumbeat of new market launches over the next 18 to 24 months.\nAt the same time, we've been very active in reimagining our existing partnerships with international distributors of our linear channels, to encourage them to support the distribution of Max in ways that are a true win-win for both parties. These partnerships help get Max on the devices of more consumers, faster and at a fraction of the acquisition cost. We've done more than 150 of these deals to date in Europe and in Latin America, and you'll begin to see them really pay off, and we have more to come.\nWe've also been big proponents of bundling, given the benefits it can provide on lowering the cost of entry for consumers, reducing churn and having an overall more positive consumer experience. And we continue to lead in this space with key players around the world, including a new bundle launched last month with [ Claro ], the biggest cable distributor in Brazil. The bundle offers Max, Netflix and [ Global play ], the largest local streamer in the market and [ Claro TV+ ].\nHere in the U.S. 2 weeks ago, we launched the ultimate bundle in the Disney+ Hulu Max package. We've been extremely pleased with the response from consumers and look forward to tracking and updating you on what we believe is a compelling consumer experience that will provide an even stronger retention profile. And in the fall, we'll roll out venue sports with ESPN and FOX.\nOf course, the most important driver of our direct-to-consumer growth is great content. And we have one of our strongest lineups over the next 2-plus years to support our global expansion. Among the many highlights from the quarter, season two of the hit series, House of the Dragon, and the Hard Knocks franchise, featuring the Giants, which have both done incredibly well.\nLooking ahead, we're excited for the highly anticipated HBO series, The Penguin, written and directed by Matt Reeves, premiering in September. The new [ Doom ] series coming in November. Blockbuster international titles like the new series, City of God: The Fight Rages On, premiering later this month, along with new seasons of hit shows, The White Lotus and The Last of Us coming next year, just to name a few.\nBottom line, the increased momentum we're enjoying underpins our outlook for positive EBITDA in the second half of the year, which will set us up well to deliver on our goal of achieving over $1 billion in EBITDA in 2025.\nOur direct-to-consumer business has also been a meaningful driver for advertising. In fact, ad sales had its biggest streaming quarter ever in Q2, in part driven by greater engagement, increased [ ad lite ] subscribers and early international traction. This contributed to a notable sequential reduction in total company advertising declines to 3% from 7% in Q1. While trends across our advertising business continue to reflect the bifurcation in the broader ad market, we remain encouraged by the healthy momentum and growing scale we see in streaming.\nTurning to the upfront. We performed well relative to the industry. Max volume grew by almost 50% as clients continue to see great value in our upscale and younger skewing audience. As well as in sponsorship opportunities in award-winning content like Season 3 of the hit series, [ The White Lotus ]. And in linear, we did especially well in sports, with strong pricing and double-digit volume growth, led by increased demand for our coverage of March Madness, Major League Baseball, NBA, the NHL, including the Stanley Club finals and new properties like NASCAR and the French Open.\nShifting focus to our studio business. We are still in the midst of what we have said will be a multiyear turnaround. There's been a great response to Twisters, which were 50% partners with Universal Pictures and [ Amblin ]. The film has become a nearly $275 million box office head and one of the year's top 10 highest grossing films worldwide. And we're excited for what's ahead with Beetle Juice 2 coming in September, and Joker, [ Folio Du ] starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga premiering in early October.\nThere's also a lot of great stuff coming from DC Studios across live action and animated film, television, games and experiences. James and Peter are fully focused on delivering on their 10-year plan for DC. If you just look at the next 6 months, the new adult animated series, [ Kite Man ], premiered on Max in July and is doing very well.\nThe incredibly moving documentary Superman, the Chris Reeves story will have a brief run in theaters in September before coming to Max. As I mentioned, the live action series, the Penguin, premiers in September, followed by The Joker in October. Then Creature Commandos, an original animated series from the mind of James Gun kicks off in December. And beyond that, James and [ Crude ] just wrapped on Superman, which is set for release in theaters on July 11. We can't wait to show this amazing film to a whole new generation of moviegoers.\nOn the Warner Bros. TV side, [ Channing ] and her team are currently producing close to 90 live action scripted, unscripted and animated series for nearly 20 different platforms. In fact, Warner Bros. Television Group is the only studio which shows on every major platform industry-wide, including [ presumed innocent ] on Apple [ TV+ ], which is now the #1 drama series in the history of the platform.\nThis is one of our superpowers. We are the most prolific producer of content for ourselves as well as third parties. As I've said many times, I believe the best content wins, and we've been working hard over the last few years to bolster our storytelling capability even further. We have the best talent, the best assets, and we're confident this gives us a strong, maybe even the strongest seat at the table.\nPivoting to sports, we're pleased with the growth and activity we're seeing across the business, both in the U.S. and abroad. I mentioned the Olympic Games, which has been a huge driver of growth for us internationally. We also saw strong momentum leading into the Olympics, with a record-breaking [ Roland Garros ] across all platforms and our best ever streaming performance for Tour de France. We also have a strong sports presence in Latin America, where we achieved record levels of engagement for Max during the knockout stages and finals of UEFA Champions League.\nAlso of note, we rebranded [ BT ] and Eurosport to TNT Sports, which is a leading at scale and growing sports platform in the U.K. The strength and growth of TNT Sports will be helpful as we launch Max in the U.K. in early 2026.\nIn the U.S., we had a big second quarter with especially strong performances by the NCAAs Men's March Madness National Championship on TBS and the NHL Stanley Cup playoffs on TNT. As a part of the growth plan we put in place at TNT Sports, we continue to build our strong portfolio of sports rights.\nIn just the last 12 months, we added NASCAR, Roland Garros Tennis, Big East Men's and Women's basketball, Mountain West Football as well as college football playoff games, all multiyear partnerships. These new rights will add scale and breadth to our existing best-in-class portfolio of Major League Baseball, NBA, NHL, U.S. men's and women's soccer, all spread across TBS, TNT, [ TruTV ] Max, House of Highlights and Bleacher Report. And as a result of all this additional quality live sports, we are now also converting TruTV to TNT Sports and Prime in October. And all of this will help support the upcoming launch of venue sports.\nWhen the service rolls out in the fall, fans will have access to an extensive offering of live games and event coverage of all the major professional sports leagues and top college conferences and popular studio shows and shoulder programming. And as we announced last week, the service will be available at a compelling price point that we're confident will appeal to the cord cutter and cord never fans, not currently served by existing pay TV packages. Needless to say, we're excited for the future of our sports business and the tremendous value we provide to fans and our partners.\nI want to make one final point. As you saw, this quarter, we recorded a noncash impairment of the goodwill attributed to our linear networks. It's fair to say that even 2 years ago, market valuations and prevailing conditions for legacy media companies were quite different than they are today. And this impairment acknowledges this and better aligns our carrying values with our future outlook. Gunnar will have more to say on this in a moment.\nWe recognized early on this was a generational disruption impacting our industry, requiring us to take bold necessary steps and to pursue opportunities we see across the media landscape to best position Warner Bros. Discovery for the future. We are uniquely advantaged with globally scaled businesses and a capital structure that allow us to make these moves in a thoughtful and strategic way.\nWe have finally launched Max globally and are pursuing bundling opportunities domestically and internationally. All to serve customers around the world with our unparalleled storytelling and content. We are positioned to grow, and while there's still lots to do, we are more confident than ever in our global strategy. Local content, local sports, best-in-class library and quality branded storytelling, a unique recipe few can do.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Gunnar.\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to focus my remarks on a few key topics before I briefly run through the quarter. First, I want to highlight the progress we're making on paying down our debt balance.\nDuring the second quarter, we successfully executed a tender for $3.4 billion of debt, utilizing $2.6 billion of cash, capturing $800 million in value from the embedded discount. We funded this debt purchase with free cash flow and an upsized eurobond offering of EUR 1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with $37.8 billion of net debt or around 4x net leverage.\nThe primary use of our free cash flow will continue to be debt pay down. We will maintain a balanced and flexible posture and weighing the benefits of purchasing debt that may be trading at a deeper discount versus the $3.8 billion that we have maturing through the end of 2025, including $800 million through the end of this year.\nWith a weighted average maturity of nearly 14 years, at an average cost of 4.6%, and with our strong free cash flows, significantly greater than our maturities in any given year for the foreseeable future, we have an advantageous capital structure to support our transformation and the growth opportunities ahead. I can't stress this point enough.\nImportantly, we have not wavered in our commitment to achieving our 2.5x to 3x gross leverage target, though admittedly on a longer time frame than initially anticipated. I am also firmly committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.\nSecond, I'd like to build on David's comments regarding the impairment charge for the Network segment. To take a step back first, Warner Bros. Discovery's balance sheet carries significant amounts of goodwill created over a series of past M&A transactions, including the formation of [ WBD ] in 2022. And of course, we regularly monitor the value and use of our assets.\nIn the second quarter, a number of triggering events, including the difference between our current market cap and the book value of the company, the continued softness in the U.S. ad market and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals required us to adjust our planning assumptions and take a $9 billion noncash impairment charge against the carrying values in the Networks segment.\nWhile I am certainly not dismissive of the magnitude of this impairment, I believe it's equally important to recognize that the flip side of this reflects the value shift across business models and our conviction and confidence in the growth and value opportunity across studios and our global direct-to-consumer business have never been stronger.\nThird, and to that point, I am very pleased with the progress we continue to make, taking Max around the globe, most recently with the successful rollout across Latin America and Europe. We have seen great momentum over the past quarter and even more so into the current, with the Olympics serving a fantastic launching pad.\nWe have talked about the substantial investments we've made, the heavy lift and the multiyear journey we're on, and it finally feels like we're beginning to see the fruits of that labor, both operationally and financially. And as David pointed out, with our strong content, both global and local, our global sports, our beloved brands, a state-of-the-art and scalable product platform now available across a rapidly expanding international footprint, and our promotional and operational infrastructure in virtually every territory of the world now fully aligned as one truly global team, we could not be more excited about what lies ahead for our streaming growth story for many years to come.\nTurning briefly to some of the key highlights from our second quarter results, which I will discuss as always on an ex FX basis. Continuing with D2C, subscriber-related revenues grew 6% during Q2, largely due to the strong momentum in advertising revenues, while content revenue declined 70% as we have previously noted, due to the timing of certain large licensing deals in the prior year.\nDomestic net add trends remain similar to the recent quarters. That is continued growth in the retail [ Max ] space, which was slightly more than offset by linear wholesale headwinds. And as we expected, we did see a modest uptick in churn after March Madness and the conclusion of the NBA and NHL seasons.\nWhile we continue to expect the bulk of total subscriber growth to emanate from outside of the U.S., as evidenced by nearly 4 million net adds internationally during Q2, we do expect to see monetization gains from all regions. With perhaps the biggest upside opportunity domestically, at least in the nearer term.\nWe recently raised the domestic ad free price by $1 and saw better-than-expected churn during July when the price increase rolled through the existing subscriber base. Streaming ad revenues doubled year-over-year on continued strong demand for Max inventory and the addition of sports content, which drove healthy engagement. We expect meaningful growth ahead as more subscribers opt for the [ ad lite ] tier, which represented over 40% of global gross [ adds ] last quarter. EBITDA was a negative $107 million, in part impacted by allocation of sports costs and EMEA launch costs.\nAll taken together, D2C is tracking better than our expectations, even with the investment heavy first half of the year. And with key launches behind us, we should begin to pivot towards second half EBITDA profitability driven by improving subscriber-related revenue trends, continued momentum behind our content slate stronger engagement fueled by a more personalized content discovery experience and continued expense discipline. In fact, I expect the D2C segment to be nicely profitable for the full year and with a strong ramp in the second half, which will represent a meaningful step towards our 2025 EBITDA target of at least $1 billion.\nThat said, as I've noted, we will always prioritize investing to secure profitable Max subscribers versus maximizing near-term EBITDA in any given quarter or year.\nTurning to Networks. Distribution revenues decreased 8% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of the AT&T [ SportsNet ], distribution revenues decreased 5% as pay TV subscribers declined 9% domestically, while domestic affiliate rates increased 5%. Network ad revenue decreased 9% as domestic impressions declined 13% during the quarter and were partially offset by strong sports-related pricing. EMEA continued to outperform and was up nicely during the quarter.\nI am also pleased that on a total company basis, we enjoyed significant sequential improvement in advertising trends down 3% in Q2 versus down 7% in Q1. Tying this back to the impairment conversation, this is another great example of how pressure in one segment goes hand-in-hand with tailwinds in another. Finally, on the Olympics, we expect just over $100 million of negative impact to EBITDA, mostly at Networks. Recall, this is the final Olympic games under the agreement we struck in 2015. And we are looking forward to our continued partnership with the IOC as our new Olympics rides agreement will begin with the 2026 winter games in Milano Cortina and which is better aligned to our streaming and pay TV platforms.\nNow turning to Studios. We enjoyed healthy theatrical revenue growth despite underperformance of recent releases and aided by strong carryover from Q1 releases. Experiences in consumer product revenues continued to perform nicely, and we remain very upbeat about the opportunity we see in better coordinating processes around managing franchises. Television was down, particularly as we work through the last of the strike delayed deliveries, which sets us up for a big swing up in the second half.\nWhile as we've called out last quarter, our games are still struggling against last year's Hogwarts Legacy comp and a muted response to Suicide Squad this year. From a modeling standpoint, while the strike impact will present the favorable year-over-year comp on EBITDA during the second half of the year, it will be a headwind to cash content spend.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated nearly $1 billion during the quarter, representing a $750 million decrease year-over-year. This was largely driven by two key factors. First, an increase in net content investment against the modest cash savings with the start of the WGA strike in the prior year. And second, lower operating profits, partially offset by lower cash restructuring costs. Finally, a few puts and takes to consider for free cash flow during the second half of the year.\nNumber one, like in Q1, we will have our normal semiannual cash interest payments during the third quarter. Number two, we will be comping against the most strike impacted quarters last year. And number three, the Olympics will be a meaningful drag on free cash flow during the third quarter, including in part due to working capital dynamics. As such, cash conversion will certainly be lower than the very elevated levels last year. That said, I remain confident in our ability to continue to both generate meaningful free cash flow in the second half and pay down debt. And we expect to finish the year at lower net leverage than at the start of the year.\nI remain very proud of our organization's dedication, resiliency and focus while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability within an industry going through so much change. I feel confident with the path that we're on and I believe we have made the right investments while better aligning our capital allocation with discipline to set the company up for long-term success.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to the operator, and David, JB and I will take your questions.",

Discovery First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAdditionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Slabin\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for Warner Bros. Discovery's Q1 Earnings Call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette; CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games.\nToday's presentation will include forward-looking statements that we made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements may include comments regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nFor additional information on factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Zaslav\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we kicked off the new year, our focus was simple: to continue building this company for the future, recognizing that it's not business as usual and that we are transforming ourselves for what's next in an industry undergoing tremendous disruption largely driven by technological innovation impacting consumer behavior. And we're embracing that innovation here at Warner Bros. Discovery with bold and courageous decision-making.\nTo that end, we've had a productive start of the year. We are pleased to see positive momentum building in several critical areas. Most notably, Max is gaining subscriber traction in all regions, adding 2 million subs this quarter with our total Direct-to-Consumer subscriber count nearing the 100 million mark. And while our U.S. subs will be impacted by some seasonality, particularly related to sports in Q2, we're on track for continued robust international growth this quarter and new subscriber highs through the remainder of the year.\nWe're also gaining ground in ad sales with an acceleration in Direct-to-Consumer and sequential improvement in linear this quarter, helped in part by a record March Madness men's basketball tournament and steadier overall ratings.\nAt the same time, we're taking meaningful steps to rebuild our Studios as the cornerstone of our storytelling engine and we're proud of the recent creative successes that have supported our #1 box office share this year, including Wonka, Dune: Part Two and Godzilla X Kong, and we're excited about the quality and breadth of our future pipeline.\nWe're also leaning into the ways that new technologies like data-driven systems and AI can improve our consumer offerings and enable us to run our businesses more productively and effectively. This is one of our top priorities.\nRegarding the balance sheet, we continued to see tangible results from our focus on transformation and efficiency. Even in our seasonally weakest free cash flow generation quarter, our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year to roughly $400 million in Q1 and $7.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. And we will continue to opportunistically manage our capital structure, evidenced by this morning's debt tender announcement.\nWhile we've accomplished a lot over the last 2 years, we're still just scratching the surface of our long list of to-dos that we see as catalyst for change, and ultimately, levers of growth for Warner Bros. Discovery. The current media landscape is increasingly dynamic, and in response, we've had to make some tough, and at times, unpopular decisions, but we are doing what we believe is necessary to best position the company for the future. And while transformation success is not easily measured in short-term months or even quarters, we're very confident in the strength of our assets and believe we will see both strategic and financial progress in the quarters ahead.\nI'll briefly touch on a few key operational milestones and objectives as we look out over the near-term landscape. On Direct-to-Consumer, this is a pivotal and critical year for Max with an aggressive relaunch and rollout underway that will meaningfully expand our global presence and growth potential. Since the start of the year, we've expanded from a single market in the U.S. to 39 countries and territories with the launch of Latin America. And over the next several weeks, we will roll the service out in over 25 additional markets across Europe, including our first new markets, France and Belgium, with more to follow.\nAnd we're launching it ahead of the Paris Olympics. Max will be the only place where viewers across Europe will be able to watch every part of the Olympic Games.\nOur goal in 2024 is to drive top line improvements and build upon the profitability we have achieved last year while positioning us to achieve our $1 billion EBITDA target for 2025 with further growth beyond. And we're off a strong start with nearly $90 million positive EBITDA generated this quarter despite absorbing some of the launch cost of LatAm. But more importantly, we're laying the critical groundwork and infrastructure from which we expect to build a broader and more profitable Direct-to-Consumer segment.\nThree key metrics underpin our strategic and financial objectives for Direct-to-Consumer. The first is subscriber growth. As I said, we're nearing the 100 million mark and see strong indicators of continued growth in Q2 and the remainder of the year.\nWe're also leveraging our best practices from the U.S. and LatAm rollouts, such as our strongest content slate yet, more partnerships in place to accelerate our rollout and an enhanced subscriber migration experience that reduces onetime churn and more optimized marketing investment.\nSecond, engagement and monetization. Thanks to a combination of stronger content and product enhancements, engagement reached an all-time high and we are taking meaningful steps to grow it further. The team continues to improve the product to deliver more personalized consumer experience, feature set and more impactful content offerings.\nAdditionally, we grew global ARPU 4% in the quarter. This, in part, reflects a greater mix shift of lower ARPU international subscribers as compared to U.S. subscribers. This quarter, U.S. ARPU grew by a healthy 8%.\nWhile we still have lots to do, I am pleased to say the content lineup on Max over the next 12 to 18 months is one of the strongest ever. March was particularly strong with March Madness and Quiet on the Set, a huge hit coming out of our ID networks. And in Q2, we'll benefit from the third season of critically acclaimed series, Hacks; the streaming premiere of Iron Claw and Dune: Part Two; Champions League in LatAm; and the June 16 premiere of season 2 of House of the Dragon, which was one of the most successful series in terms of engagement and subscriber acquisition, just to name a few.\nIn addition to House of the Dragon, over the next 18 months, Max will premiere a robust combination of high-impact global original series, including season 3 of the White Lotus; season 2 of The Last of Us, season 3 of And Just Like That; along with highly anticipated tent-pole original series, including The Penguin; Dune: Prophecy, It: Welcome to Derry; A Night of the Seven Kingdoms, a spinoff of the Game of Thrones franchise, plus an ongoing slate of fresh new Warner Bros. theatrical releases, such as Godzilla X Kong, Furiosa, Beetlejuice, Joker 2 and more.\nThe third metric is churn, which, while still above our longer-term target, continues to trend downwards, and in fact, was at an all-time low in the U.S. at the end of the first quarter. Habituality and diversity of viewing are the most correlated inputs to churn, and we saw continued healthy improvements in both in the first quarter. And with our even stronger content lineup coming over the next few quarters as well as our ongoing user experience enhancements, we feel confident about our trajectory.\nAs you know, I have been a big proponent of bundling. And yesterday, together with Disney, we announced a first-of-its-kind offering that gives U.S. consumers the option of an ad-lite or ad-free package that includes Max, Disney+ and Hulu. The product will go live later this summer and we couldn't be more excited. Two of the world's most storied content companies are joining forces to deliver consumers the best and most diverse offering of entertainment at a very attractive price.\nAnd in addition to the unprecedented consumer value this product will provide, there's real business benefits as well. The modest overlap between the 3 services means we have an opportunity to drive incremental subscriber growth. And also because the consumers will have to retain all three, Disney+, Hulu and Max, to take advantage of the price value in the offering, we expect this product will help increase retention and lower churn and thus support higher customer lifetime values.\nAnd finally, over time, as the bundle gets more traction, we will benefit from increased efficiencies and greater marketing effectiveness.\nThe bundle will go live later this summer and we're excited about what it could mean for our business going forward.\nOf course, the heart and soul of our company is storytelling, and we are using all the formidable assets and the greatest creative minds to tell the best stories in the best ways possible as we strive to return the luster to Warner Bros. Pictures. Clearly, this takes time and it's not something that can be accomplished overnight. And the heavy lifting taking place under Mike and Pam's leadership at Warner Bros. Pictures and under Peter and James at DC isn't something that you see fully reflected yet in our financials. However, we are confident it will become more apparent with time.\nAnd in fact, we are seeing some strong proof points of our bold, more disciplined approach while we continue working through the remainder of the slate that was in place when we took over the business. Warner Bros. generated more than $1.8 billion in global box office since the start of the year, and it was the first studio this year to reach $1 billion in both overseas and worldwide box office.\nAnd they've got a great slate in the works. This morning, I'm excited to announce that the team is now in the early stages of script development for the first of the new Lord of the Rings movies, which we anticipate releasing in 2026 and will explore storylines yet to be told. Peter Jackson and his long-time writing partners, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, are producing and will be involved every step of the way. Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for our theatrical business.\nWarner Bros. Discovery's great storytelling IP, including Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Superman and many other parts of the DC Universe are largely underused. We are hard at work fixing that. It's a core value and a key advantage for us. We have the characters and stories people love and yearn for everywhere in the world in every language.\nUnfortunately, the Studio's Q1 financials were overshadowed by the tough comp at games following the great performance of Hogwarts Legacy last year and the disappointing release of Suicide Squad in Q1 in our gaming group.\nOn the advertising front, while total company ad sales were down 7% in the quarter, we continue to see sequential improvement Q2 to date led by what we anticipate will be our biggest Direct-to-Consumer quarter ever. As we highlighted last quarter and underpinning some of this improvement is the resiliency of international linear advertising, primarily from our free-to-air channels in EMEA, which outperformed in the quarter with positive revenue growth. This was primarily driven by robust revenue growth in Poland, Italy and Germany. These firmly entrenched legacy broadcast assets continue to serve as highly effective platforms for advertisers to reach consumers. And while we just launched our international ad-lite offering in LatAm with EMEA soon to come, these platforms will be critical to enhance our portfolio offerings.\nWhile linear has obvious secular challenges, we continue to see select opportunities. For example, U.S. Networks production hubs can be sourced as a popular high ROI content for both linear and streaming. This is a benefit we will pursue where it makes sense, particularly as a more intelligent Max platform helps to inform how we allocate content budgets across specific genres and verticals.\nFor example, Max's hit, Quiet on the Set, which I mentioned earlier, was created by the team at ID, became the most watched title on streaming in its debut week with a massive 1.2 billion minutes of viewing time. The true crime vertical has great traction on Max. And by leveraging the production scale at ID, we will be able to curate additional series very effectively and efficiently that work across Max and our other distribution platforms.\nI mentioned AI earlier. We recognize that AI is going to have an increasing impact on society and our industry, and we intend to take full advantage to enhance the products and experiences we deliver to consumers and to achieve greater efficiency company-wide. We are focused particularly on improvements to our ad targeting and recommendation algorithms. Our AI-based understanding of our customers and content are being activated in our product, marketing and ad sales, which you'll hear more about at our next week's Upfront.\nSince the initial launch of Max, we've been using AI and machine learning to personalize content discovery. We've continuously innovated to improve our models to present the right content in front of our consumers at the right time, and this is helping us to drive better content diversity on Max.\nWe've also been leveraging AI to more efficiently and swiftly identify and optimize ad-break opportunities in our premium HBO content, which typically does not have natural ad breaks. This has enabled us to offer the premium content on our ad-lite tier and it's also allowed us to create variable ad load for our content as we monetize it using multiple tiers and platforms.\nAnd we have dozens of other experiments across a spectrum of areas ranging from corporate and developer efficiency to marketing optimization and targeting. All this experimentation is guided by clearly defined AI principles. We believe strongly the creativity and the kind of empathy and humanity necessary to create world-class storytelling can only be found in people, not systems. We also believe that AI is another in a long line of technology and tools that will enable creators to innovate and evolve how we tell stories and inspire audiences.\nBefore I close, I want to mention a topic I know is top of mind for everyone and that's the NBA. We've enjoyed a strong partnership with the NBA for almost 4 decades. We're in continuing conversations with them now and we're hopeful that we'll be able to reach an agreement that makes sense for both sides. We've had a lot of time to prepare for this negotiation and we have strategies in place for the various potential outcomes.\nHowever, now is not the time to discuss any of this since we are in active negotiations with the league, and under our current deal with the NBA, we have matching rights that allow us to match third-party offers before the NBA enters into an agreement with them. With that in mind, please understand that this is as much as we're prepared to say about this topic today.\nThese are challenging times for our industry, there's no question. But the reality is, and I tell my team this all the time, there isn't a more exciting moment to be in this business. We continue to do the hard work to transform our company to drive meaningful growth in the future. We are positioning ourselves to take full advantage of opportunities that we see around us. And we're more confident than ever in our assets and our playbook.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gunnar and he'll walk you through the financials for the quarter.\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nChief Financial Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by spending a minute or two on the balance sheet and highlighting the key factors that underpinned the $1.3 billion positive year-over-year swing in Q1 free cash flow in what is our seasonally weakest cash production quarter and where we typically see more cash outflows than inflows.\nNamely, number one, the continued benefit from the many initiatives to improve working capital, which we are still in the early innings of realizing. Number two, the more disciplined and analytical approach to content investment and allocation. Number three, meaningfully lower cash restructuring costs. And number four, lower cash interest expense as a result of the more than $6 billion of debt we repaid over the past 12 months.\nThe primary use of our free cash flow remains delevering the balance sheet. We remain committed to our gross leverage target range of 2.5x to 3x, and I'm confident that we will continue to make progress towards further delevering this year. We paid down over $1 billion of debt during the first quarter, including nearly $400 million from open market purchases at a discount.\nI continue to view our debt stack as an important and valuable resource. Our weighted average maturity is roughly 15 years with very manageable average annual maturities for the foreseeable future with maturities in any given year, significantly less than what our annual free cash flows have been even normalized for the strikes. Our debt is virtually all fixed with an average cost of 4.6%, in line with the yield on comparable U.S. long-dated treasury.\nBased on the difference of current market value to book value reflecting the current rate environment versus when issued, we have a $6 billion asset in our debt stack. And you should expect that we will begin to be more opportunistic in monetizing this asset as evidenced by the debt tender that we announced this morning. We intend to repurchase outstanding debt using up to $1.75 billion of cash.\nTurning to the segment results, I'd like to provide some brief commentary to supplement the discussions in the earnings release. Starting with Studios. The $400 million-plus year-over-year decline in Q1 was primarily due to the very tough comp we faced in games against the success of Hogwart's Legacy last year in the first quarter in conjunction with the disappointing Suicide Squad release this past quarter, which we impaired, leading to a $200 million impact to EBITDA during the first quarter. This overshadowed an otherwise very bright spot from the contributions of recently released theatrical films where we have had excellent traction to start the year.\nI'm excited that we have broken ground on a significant expansion project at our world-class production facility in Leavesden, U.K., a great example of where we are making long-term investments at the heart of our company with an attractive return profile.\nIt's also another example of how our new [ One WBD ] processes are supporting the Studio leadership team and combining creative excellence with overall financial discipline. While the Studio business will always characterize by hits and misses, with these more rigorous processes in place, I have no doubt that we should realize more upside to the bottom line with our hits while reducing the bottom line drag from our misses.\nTurning to D2C. We have successfully migrated the HBO Max subscriber base in Latin America over the past couple of months. To be clear, this was no easy feat with 160 platform integrations that were required to migrate existing subscribers to the new service. This requires significant management time and resources and we transitioned subscribers with better-than-expected migration-related churn in part attributable to the best practices from the U.S. relaunch.\nAn important outcome for LatAm relaunch is the ability to now offer more consumer-friendly pricing and packaging across ad-lite, ad-free and premium tiers with more flexibility in subscription options and additional paths to monetize the base. For example, installment billing for consumers who are unable to pay their full multi-month subscription price upfront. We will apply a similar approach to customer segmentation in EMEA.\nLevers of D2C growth include our significant opportunity to further scale the international subscriber base while improving worldwide monetization. As we push further into this geographic expansion, we are taking a more holistic view of our distribution deals with partners that both distribute our linear content offering as well as wholesale our Max streaming service. Thus far, we have, in many cases, captured greater overall value to WBD while managing the transition from linear to streaming.\nAnd with our strong start in Q1, I expect us to remain profitable in the D2C segment during 2024 despite the heavy launch investments, and I remain fully confident in our path to achieve our $1 billion-plus EBITDA target for 2025 and our growth ambitions thereafter.\nOne final note on D2C. Content revenue was down 46% during Q1. And as a reminder, we will have a more difficult comp in Q2, both of which are the product of timing of output deals renewed last year, the availability of content as well as our content utilization choices.\nTurning now to advertising. We did see sequential improvement, both linear and D2C, in the first quarter. Total company advertising in Q1 was down 7%, a sequential improvement of 300 basis points and was supported by a 70% growth at D2C, which is beginning to scale nicely and where we expect another record quarter in Q2. It also, in part, reflects an increasingly more holistic portfolio approach to monetizing viewership of both linear and Max, supporting our ability to offer our partners incremental reach and more customized ad solutions spanning all platforms, particularly in the U.S.\nThe trend in quarter-to-date linear cash pacings in the U.S. continues to improve modestly even excluding the positive impact of the NCAA Men's Final 4 and the championship game. As a reminder, we will benefit from having these games exclusive to WBD this year, but we do not have the Stanley Cup Finals and the exit of the AT&T SportsNet will continue to be a headwind to revenues with marginal profit impact through the end of Q3.\nInternationally, EMEA continues to be a standout bright spot, particularly in our free-to-air market. Advertising revenue grew nicely in Q1 and we're seeing a continuation of this trend in Q2. Poland, Italy and Germany were notable out-performers among the key EMEA markets. In fact, except for the U.K. and the Nordics, advertising revenues were flat to up in virtually all EMEA market during the first quarter.\nThough materially smaller, Latin America has been and continues to be a different story, particularly given cyclical and secular headwinds in Brazil and Mexico, our 2 largest markets in the region. And unlike in Europe where we are a scale broadcaster in several markets, we are more exposed to the less resilient pay-TV ecosystem that is experiencing a more pronounced secular shift of advertising dollars to streaming.\nWith Max now in the region, we have a growing ad-lite presence and are better positioned to capture a share of this migration. We look forward to updating you on our progress here, which, while early, is exceeding our expectations thus far.\nFinally, I'd like to update you on our continuing transformation efforts where we've made enormous progress on capturing cost efficiency throughout the company over the last few years. We continue to push forward with new initiatives and have added to the pipeline of opportunities. We now see a path to meaningfully exceed the more than $1 billion of remaining cost savings that we had previously guided to, which is on top of the more than $4 billion that we already realized through the end of 2023. I would best characterize these efforts as a continuous improvement mindset, having become muscle memory for the WBD team.\nWe see tangible further benefits from consolidation of real estate facilities and taking advantage of the great talent across our global capability centers. As well, we see meaningful savings from the ongoing consolidation of one dozen global content workflow systems. As noted, identifying opportunities to utilize AI to increase productivity in all facets of business operations remains a top priority that may drive further upside to our updated cost savings target.\nI am proud of the continued progress we are making to best position Warner Bros. Discovery to respond to the changes taking place in the industry. Indeed, this demands us making difficult and bold decisions. We are focused on doing what is right for the long-term health and sustainability of the business to best serve the need of customers and partners while positioning the company to drive long-term shareholder value.\nNow I'd like to return the call back to the operator, and David, JB and I will take your questions.",

Discovery Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Slabin\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Warner Bros. Discovery's Q4 earnings call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games.\nToday's presentation will include forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may include comments regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For additional information on factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, in its reports on Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Zaslav\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Our top priority this year was to get this company on solid footing and on a pathway to growth, and we've done that. We said we would be less than 4x levered, and we are. We paid down $5.4 billion in debt for the year for a total of more than $12.4 billion since the deal closed. We're now at 3.9x and expect to continue to delever in 2024.\nWe've significantly enhanced the efficiency of the organization with a long runway still to go. We said we were going to generate meaningful free cash flow, a key KPI for our leadership and company, and we've exceeded our goal with $6.2 billion for the year. Gunnar will take you through the financials. But I would just highlight that as we look at the start of the first quarter, 2 months in, we are already seeing markedly improved free cash flow for Q1 versus first quarter last year, and inflection sequentially in linear and acceleration in streaming advertising. We are optimistic that the efforts we've undertaken on digital and advanced advertising solutions, much of which you'll hear about leading up to and during the upfront, will enable us to achieve a more competitive profile.\nBottom line, we're a far healthier company now and we're building real momentum. And we expect 2024 will be a year to drive that momentum forward even further. That said, this business is not without its challenges. Among them, we continue to face the impacts of ongoing disruption in the pay-TV ecosystem and a dislocated linear advertising ecosystem. We are challenging our leaders to find innovative solutions. For example, our U.S. networks and sports teams have been collaborating on a number of initiatives aimed at expanding audience reach and impact through cross-promotion. And I do believe we are getting smarter at determining what's working and what's not, which is helping to drive healthy traction in ratings and an improved near-term outlook in advertising revenue.\nInternationally, Gerhard Zeiler and his regional teams are doing an outstanding job as international networks are performing strongly and gaining momentum, particularly in EMEA. Of note, linear advertising in EMEA was positive in Q4, with standout markets in Poland, Germany and Italy, the latter of which is enjoying a truly material upswing in ratings behind some of the incredibly successful programming moves at flagship Nova, which had its best quarter ever in Q4.\nI was just in Italy 2 weeks ago and spent some time with the team. Their ratings this quarter are tracking up over 20%. It's a terrific creative team, and they have some real momentum. In fact, EMEA enjoyed its largest quarterly year-over-year share growth since the outset of the pandemic in 2020, despite some sluggishness in the U.K. and in certain Nordic markets. This next chapter for Warner Bros. Discovery is about putting us on a pathway to growth.\nAnd we've got a lot of drivers of that growth, which, at its core, is underpinned by great storytelling. We are a creative storytelling company powered by 100 years of arguably the best franchises, brands, libraries and content in the business, and we are on offense. Our studios are back and firing on nearly all cylinders after the strikes. We're one of the biggest makers and sellers of content in the world.\nOn the theatrical and gaming side, while we did have some real misses this year, we also had some really big wins, including Barbie, the #1 movie globally and the most successful movie in the history of Warner Bros; and Hogwarts Legacy, the biggest game of 2023. Also in 2023, we relaunched our theatrical animation division with a commitment to have 2 features a year on our slate beginning in 2026. Bill Domanski is leading our animation division after spending 2 decades at DreamWorks, and he's hard at work here with us on the lot.\nNow with the addition of animation, DC and our existing Warner Bros. and Newline cinema labels, we have created a home for every kind of film and story to be told, and we are excited about what's ahead for moviegoing audiences.\nWe've had a challenging couple of years, but we are now very excited about our slate in the year ahead. Starting with Dune Part 2, which arrives in theaters a week from today and a strong tracking, 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is rare for a sequel. We also have Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire, a follow-up to the hugely successful 2021 film opening next month.\nWhen we launched this company almost 2 years ago, we made it clear. We believe in this business, we're a pure storytelling company, and we're going to bring the best people in front of and behind the camera back to Warner Bros., and we have been laser focused on doing just that.\nFirst, Warner Bros. is back in business with Tom Cruise. Our partnership with Tom is off and running. Mike and Pam spent a couple of days hard at work with Tom in London earlier this month. As you saw yesterday, we are in negotiations for a new film by Academy Award winner, Alejandro Inarritu, starring Tom. This will be the first of many films with us and Tom, and we look forward to a long future together.\nPaul Thomas Anderson is also at Warner hard at work on his new film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Regina Hall. Maggie Gyllenhaal's new movie is set to begin shooting soon, starting Christian Bale, Jessie Buckley, Penelope Cruz and Annette Bening. Black Panther's director, Ryan Coogler and star, Michael B. Jordan, are coming together for a new original genre film that will go in front of cameras later this spring. George Clooney is back with Warner Bros. and working on a number of exciting projects.\nOn the TV side, we just announced another season of the hit show True Detective, with creator and showrunner, Issa Lopez. Juggernaut series, The White Lotus, from creator and showrunner, Mike White, is currently in production. And Craig Mazin has started filming the new season of the hit show The Last of Us.\nIt's really encouraging to see so many incredibly talented creatives here at Warner Bros. And most importantly, they share our vision: To be a home to great storytelling. Stories that entertain, inform, and when we are at our best, inspire. This is the Warner Brothers we are building together. This is the Warner Bros. of the future.\nA real strategic advantage we have as a company, and I've talked about it often, is the strength and depth of our franchises, which I believe will be a meaningful driver of asset value and growth for us. We intend to deliver on our commitment to reinvigorate the best of them. And as I've said, our major franchises have been underused and underleveraged. We are hard at work to begin to get full value.\nSuperman, we haven't made a Superman movie in over a decade. James Gunn's Superman starts filming next week. I've had a glimpse into what James and Peter are doing and it really does serve as an exciting indicator of where the new DC is headed under their leadership, and there'll be more that you'll hear from them in the months ahead. Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin is in preproduction for the new spin-off, A Night of the 7 Kingdoms, which will premiere in late 2025 on Max.\nHarry Potter. We've not been shy about our excitement around Harry Potter. The last film was made more than a dozen years ago. I was in London a few weeks ago with KC and Channing, and we spent some real time with JK and her team. Both sides are thrilled to be reigniting this franchise. Our conversations were great, and we couldn't be more excited about what's ahead. We can't wait to share a decade of new stories with fans around the world on Max. We're aiming for a debut in 2026. The top priority for us has been building Max our streaming service. We fought hard to get Max to be profitable last year. We are now committed to driving profitable top line growth. And while it's still early innings, we feel good about the trajectory we're on and are on track to achieve our guidance of $1 billion in EBITDA in 2025.\nWe're especially excited about the next 24 months. We have a number of meaningful growth levers ahead, including the rollout of Max in key international regions and markets, starting with Latin America next week. With markets in EMEA and APAC to follow later in the year, including new markets, France and Belgium to coincide with the Paris Olympics this summer. Keep in mind, we are only available in less than half the addressable households and markets as compared to our larger peers, so we still have a huge opportunity for growth from globalization over the next 2 years, including many critical markets around the globe, such as the U.K., Germany, Italy, Australia and Japan, all of which we have a substantial amount of local content, and in many, we have sports as well.\nWe're also driving better segmentation and monetization by launching the new ad-supported offering, which is currently only available here in the U.S. And by the end of this year will be available in over 40 markets globally as well. We also have a number of lucrative partnership deals internationally that will help us scale in more efficient and accelerated fashion.\nIt's worth noting that Q4 saw the lowest U.S. churn rates in HBO Max and Max's history. And the personalization and product improvements planned for this year should continue to have positive impact on churn. And finally, we're excited to be refreshing and reigniting our content pipeline at Max. The fact is, the strikes really slowed down production and we didn't have as much content as we wanted for Max. And we're now moving forward with a great slate.\nOur most recent series, True Detective: Night Country, starring Jodie Foster, was a real success, averaging over 12.5 million viewers, the highest season ever for the series. Looking ahead, we've got one of the best lineups in the history of HBO. This next quarter will have Hacks and House of the Dragon, followed by DCs The Penguin and the new Dune series. Then in 2025, we'll kick off the year with the new season of The White Lotus, followed by The Last of Us and Euphoria, just to name a few.\nAlso coming to Max from Warner Bros. Motion Pictures are Aquaman and the Last Kingdom on February 27. Wonka will join the service on March 8. Followed by Dune Part 2 in the spring. We also inked a multiyear deal with A24 in December to bring A24's theatrical releases exclusively to Max. They've already started being carried.\nI want to mention one other area of our business before turning it over to Gunnar to talk through the quarter. As you heard last week, we're entering a new joint venture with Disney and Fox focused on sports. We believe this will provide a terrific consumer experience and will be a great business. We couldn't be more excited about it.\nWe'll also be able to bundle this product with Max, so we see this new joint venture as another potential driver of incremental growth for our business going forward.\nOne more point on our sports business. Last weekend, we saw a great coverage and strong ratings at the NBA All-Star Game and All-Star Weekend. We have a strong, positive 40-year relationship with the NBA. And in terms of our NBA rights, we are now full engaged in renewal discussions and they are constructive and productive.\nOur global sports portfolio continues to provide real meaningful value to all of our platforms. We're proud to be the home of one of the most coveted collections of premium sports content in the industry, along with the best-in-class talent roster and exceptional production values. We're excited for our expansive coverage of the Paris Summer Olympics throughout all of Europe as well.\nThe hard work we've done over the last nearly 2 years has positioned us well, financially and creatively. And as we look towards the future, we will continue to make the tough calls and do what is necessary to get this business on a clear pathway to growth and to drive increased shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gunnar, and he'll walk you through the financials for the quarter.\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nChief Financial Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. 2023 was indeed a year marked by the accomplishment of several key objectives, and I'm very pleased with the effort across the organization to evolve our company as our industry continues to change. We come into 2024 well positioned and, once again, with an ambitious agenda to further enhance our financial and strategic profile, and to drive meaningful long-term shareholder value. .\nThough we grew EBITDA 12% for the year on a pro forma basis, more than $1 billion year-over-year, the enormous financial benefits of our many important and successful transformative efforts have been somewhat mitigated by sustained headwinds across the industry, yet we made strong progress against this backdrop this year, and I'd like to highlight a few notable accomplishments.\nFirst, our post-merger integration is substantively complete as of the end of 2023. We have now achieved total combined merger and transformation savings of $4 billion, not including the significant savings realized on content as well. As David has laid out before, while we talked about synergies, we're really applying a fundamentally different management approach to the combined company, data-driven and rational with shareholder value at the center.\nThere are substantial improvement opportunities left for us to capture, particularly in areas such as enterprise systems, production flow, global centers of excellence, to name a few, and we expect to see this reflected in our near- and long-term free cash flow generation. This is an entire organization buying into and operating with a one team, one company mindset.\nSecond, our streaming team has made the turn. The D2C segment generated approximately $100 million of positive EBITDA, a $2.2 billion improvement year-over-year on a pro forma basis, well ahead of our targets. This was accomplished with a tremendous level of rigor and discipline across every aspect of the business from programming to marketing to technology. And as expected, we've begun to see an inflection in subscriber-related revenues, both distribution and advertising, which accelerated to over 6% during the second half of the year versus very modest growth in the first, helped by price increases, growth in the Ultimate tier and scaling of the Ad Light subscriber base.\n2024 will indeed be a pivotal year for Max. Relaunches and rebranding in existing Latin American and European markets over the next few months will be critical to bringing consumers an improved product experience and a more robust content offering, which will put us on better competitive footing. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to investing in subscriber growth, mindful of lifetime value to subscriber acquisition cost ratios as we proceed into this next phase.\nD2C advertising growth should layer in nicely throughout the year, and the business is gaining momentum as it scales. With a more high-profile slate of shows from HBO scheduled for release throughout the year as compared to the second half of 2023, we're very well positioned to offer a greater share of highly coveted premium streaming inventory.\nThird, you have heard us talk about the free cash flow opportunity since we first announced the deal. In 2023, we generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, a 60% conversion of our EBITDA to free cash flow. The impact of the strikes contributed roughly $1 billion to free cash flow, while negatively impacting our EBITDA by a few hundred million dollars. We made great strides in realizing capital efficiencies throughout the year, and it was particularly evident in Q4 with over $3.3 billion of free cash flow generated this quarter alone.\nI am very pleased with the momentum here as the focus of the entire team continues to shift towards a deeper understanding of capital returns and shareholder value. We have laid a very solid foundation in 2023, and I expect 2024 to be another strong free cash flow year.\nFinally, all of this has helped support $5.4 billion of debt paydown during the year, including all of our more expensive variable rate term loans, enabling us to finish 2023 with less than $40 billion of net debt and resulting in net leverage of 3.9x EBITDA, in line with our guidance from last February despite all the headwinds mentioned earlier.\nI am very pleased and comfortable with our current capital structure, given the tremendous progress we have made. The entirety of our outstanding debt is now fixed with an average cost of 4.6% and average duration of 15 years. Importantly, we have only very manageable amounts of debt coming due over the next 3 years: $1.8 billion this year, $3.1 billion next year and $2.3 billion in 2026, providing us with real flexibility in how exactly we delever the company.\nWe remain committed to our long-term gross leverage target of 2.5 to 3x. And while we do not expect to hit that target by the end of this year, as we noted on our last earnings call, we do expect to continue delevering in 2024 as we stay focused on debt repayment with our free cash flows and any proceeds from noncore asset sales, like the All3Media sale announced last week.\nTurning briefly to the quarter, which I will discuss on a constant currency basis. I'd like to call out a few items and offer some additional puts and takes to consider for each of the segments. Starting with Studios. The primary callouts were, number one, the impact of the strikes, as I noted, which halted the production and delivery of TV content during the fourth quarter, which also informed some of our decisions about retaining or licensing content externally in the second half of the year.\nAnd two, what can best be characterized as an inconsistent performance of the theatrical slate. Wonka, the cofinancing partnership has had great success at the global box office and performed well above expectations, while Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom and The Color Purple, unfortunately did not. This was evident in our lower-than-expected financial results across revenue and EBITDA.\nA couple of items to consider for the Studios segment during the coming quarter. We are lapping the release of Hogwarts Legacy in February last year, which saw the largest portion of its very positive financial impact in the first quarter. This year, Suicide Squad, one of our key video game releases in 2024, has fallen short of our expectations since its release in the quarter, setting our games business up for a tough year-over-year comp in Q1.\nOn the film side, Q1 will be burdened with the marketing campaigns for Dune 2 and Godzilla versus Kong, which opens at the very end of the quarter.\nTurning to Networks. Revenues decreased 8% as advertising decreased 14% due to continuing softness in the U.S. linear advertising market. Note the disposition of the AT&T SportsNet negatively advertising revenues by approximately 100 basis points during the quarter. While still not back to where we'd like it to be, we are seeing a nice improvement thus far in Q1. Domestic ad sales are pacing meaningfully better quarter-to-date as we are beginning to capture the benefits of our strong upfront deals struck last year.\nInternational ad sales, which accounts for over 20% of total network ad sales, continue to be firm overall, particularly in EMEA, which represents over 3/4 of International ad revenues, and where we saw modest growth year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Like the U.S., we're seeing acceleration through the beginning of the first quarter so far in EMEA overall, while we continue to face a challenging market environment in LatAm as ad dollars more steadily migrate to streaming, which ultimately presents a nice opportunity for Max as we relaunch in these markets.\nNetworks distribution revenues were effectively flat in the quarter after adjusting for the 400 basis point headwind from exiting the AT&T SportsNet and transferring the TNT Sports Chile business to the B2C segment. On a reported basis, revenue decreased 3% as U.S. pay-TV subscriber declines outpaced U.S. affiliate rate increases. While inflationary impacts, supported by inflation-linked pricing agreements in Argentina also benefited results.\nOverall, Networks EBITDA decreased 11% as the decline in high-margin advertising revenues was only partially offset by a 3% decrease in operating expenses, excluding the AT&T SportsNet and TNT Sports Chile impact.\nTurning now to D2C. We finished the quarter with nearly 98 million subscribers, a modest sequential increase after accounting for the full consolidation following our acquisition of the outstanding shares of BluTV, as well as transferring our TNT Sports Chile subs to the D2C segment as part of our premium sports streaming strategy.\nInternational remains the most important driver of our D2C subscriber growth with over 1 million subscribers gained in Q4. This more than offset domestic declines, where we continue to feel the impact of the partly strike-driven lack of fresh tentpole content through the second half of the year. And as discussed before, remember that linear wholesale losses continue to mask underlying retail D2C traction.\nContent revenue in the segment declined 30% due to the intra-year timing of third-party licensing deals that we laid out in detail earlier in the year. Keep this in mind as we comp this in Q2 of 2024. Among the D2C subscriber-related revenues, which were up over 6% in the quarter, distribution revenues increased 4% and benefited from price increases in the U.S. and certain international markets, as well as the Amazon Prime partnership in the U.S. which we lapped in December.\nAdvertising revenues accelerated nicely versus Q3 to over 50%, helped by the '23, '24 upfront deals, higher engagement on Max and Ad Light subscriber growth. We currently see the pace of D2C advertising revenue accelerating off this pace in Q1 and expect this to be an impactful segment driver for 2024 overall.\nWith regional relaunches and key new market launches heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, we expect D2C EBITDA to be modestly negative in the first half and then profitable again in the second half. Net-net, we currently expect the D2C segment to be profitable for the year as we continue to pivot our focus on profitable top line growth. We remain focused on our target of $1 billion in D2C segment EBITDA in 2025, and 2024 will certainly lay important foundations for achieving this goal.\nTurning to our outlook for Q1 free cash flow. We're off to an outstanding start. Remember, Q1 is traditionally our seasonally weakest quarter, yet we see continued strong momentum so far and expect a very meaningful improvement year-over-year versus the negative $930 million we incurred last year. We continue to capture our cash opportunities, and I believe we have many more bites at the apple for years to come.\nLet me mention additional puts and takes to consider as you think about free cash flow for the year. Number one, the net cash benefit from the strikes, which will reverse this year as content production resumes to normalized levels, will naturally be a negative to free cash flow. We incurred roughly $1 billion in integration-related cash costs, a little lower than what we had anticipated for 2023 due to the timing of certain initiatives. As we continue to execute on our transformation journey, we will likely incur some additional cash restructuring costs, but we expect this to be at a significantly lower level.\nNumber three, the Olympics will be a drag to free cash flow this year, given its working capital dynamic. Number four, interest expense will certainly be lower in 2024 as we continue to delever and CapEx will likely be slightly lower as well. And finally, of course, EBITDA will be the biggest determinant of free cash flow.\nBefore I turn it back for Q&A, I'd like to finish with the final remark on the magnitude of change that's taken place at WBD, it really is night and day versus where we started. Of course, we still have additional work to do and more opportunity to capture, but the heavy lifting we've done helped pave the way for ongoing transformation and our ability to embrace the 3 pillars of our strategy, which reflect our strong commitment to quality storytelling, achieving maximum value through broad distribution and monetization, and operating professionally with one company mindset.\nWe are significantly closer to our longer-term leverage targets with more than $12 billion of debt paid down in less than 2 years. Certainly, having a more flexible financial profile doesn't insulate us, or anyone else for that matter, from having creative wins and losses. But it most certainly will help us take the necessary steps required to further achieve our growth objectives and to more intently focus on driving shareholder value.\nNow David, JB and I will take your questions.",

A copy of our Q3 earnings release, trending schedule and accompanying slide deck will be available on our website at ir.wbd.com.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Zaslav\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying that we are hopeful we will reach a resolution to the SAG-AFTRA strike soon. We made a last and final offer, which met virtually all of the union's goals and includes the highest wage increase in 40 years and believe it provides for a positive outcome for all involved. We recognize that we need our creative partners to feel valued and rewarded, and look forward to both sides getting back to the business of telling great stories.\nAs the strikes underscored, these are challenging times. Our industry is facing accelerated disruption and a rapidly changing marketplace. And to succeed long term, we must be flexible and adaptable and have a strong arsenal of assets that will enable us to maintain momentum amidst ever-evolving consumer behavior. And at Warner Bros. Discovery, we are and we do.\nFor the last 19 months, we have been relentlessly focused on reinventing this company, repositioning it as a more stable, efficient free cash flow-generating business. While we are and always will be a work in progress and while we are thoughtfully navigating industry-wide challenges like a strained advertising market, our teams continue to execute on our strategy.\nMore broadly, we generated over $2 billion in free flow in Q3 and are on track to meaningfully exceed $5 billion for the year. This has made it possible for us to aggressively pay down our debt, which we've reduced by nearly $12 billion since launching the company last year. And as we've said, by the end of the fourth quarter, we will be meaningfully below 4x net levered.\nWhile paying down debt and delevering will remain a top priority for us, we're also now in a position to allocate more capital toward growth opportunities. Our asset mix, one of the most complete and diversified in the industry, positions us as well as any to drive long-term value. We possess the full slate of production and distribution capabilities as one of the preeminent makers and sellers of content in the world. And as you know, we are home to many of the most iconic brands and franchises in the history of entertainment.\nOf course, we believe the real power lies not just in the storytelling IP, brands and franchises, as formidable as they are, but in the opportunities we create as one company to maximize their impact, reach and, ultimately, their value. As I said previously, a lot of our most popular IP has been underused. There are great new stories waiting to be told and exciting new ways to bring those stories and characters to life across screens, consumer products, experiences and more.\nWe recognize that we can do a better job of managing and maximizing the value of our blue-chip franchises like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and Superman. Each represents an ecosystem of storytelling possibilities, and we intend to capitalize on their potential with a more focused franchise management approach and look forward to bringing in a new Global Head of Franchise, as we discussed 2 weeks ago. This person will work closely with the leaders of our businesses to identify opportunities to expand the reach and impact our storytelling IP across the full range of consumer touch points. More on this soon.\nOne of the big advantages we have at Warner Bros. Discovery is that we own and control all of our content and storytelling IP, and that allows us to distribute it in ways that maximize reach and profitability. Of course, the top priority for us is our streaming service, Max. We continue to be very pleased with the strong foundation that JB, Casey and the team have put in place to first stabilize and now grow the business.\nIn Q3, we generated another quarter of positive EBITDA behind both distribution and advertising revenue growth. And we recently layered in live programming, underpinning a broad content offering that appeals to a wider spectrum of consumers and is showing increased engagement and lower churn.\nAnd while the third quarter subscriber numbers were impacted by one of our lightest original content schedules in years, in part due to the strike constraints that compelled us to delay some releases, as well as a further decline in the overlapping discovery+ subscriber base, which we expected and discussed with you, we are very excited about our more robust content slate as we head into the strong 2024 and beyond.\nWe've got a fantastic lineup planned, including the new season of True Detective: Night Country with Oscar winner, Jodie Foster, which will premiere on January 14; followed in the spring by the new limited series, The Regime, starring Oscar winner, Kate Winslet.\nLater in the year, we'll see The Sympathizer, an espionage thriller based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by the same name and produced and co-starring Robert Downey Jr.; The Franchise, a half-hour comedy about superhero moviemaking created by Armando Iannucci and Sam Mendes; The Penguin, a limited series based on the DC comics character set in the Matt Reeves Batverse and starring Colin Farrell.\nAnd we're also looking forward to new seasons of award-winning series such as House of the Dragon and Curb Your Enthusiasm, just to name a few. And in 2025, we'll have brand-new seasons of The Last of Us, Euphoria, White Lotus and more. We're confident this great new content will further fuel Max' popularity, both domestically and around the world. Coupled with our new live programming, it really does provide an exceptional offering for consumers.\nIn October, we launched CNN Max, a 24/7 streaming offering with live news, analysis and original programming from the most recognizable news brand in the world. And while CNN is a strong linear asset, we also appreciate there's a segment of the population, mostly young people, who don't subscribe to cable. And this new streaming product appeals to them as well, as evidenced by CNN Max viewers being nearly 20 years younger than traditional linear viewers and the vast majority of our CNN Max viewers being non-pay TV subs.\nWe're analyzing everything we're learning in these early stages, and we'll continue to iterate and improve the offering. But the key takeaway here is that we saw an opportunity and we were able to pivot quickly, seamlessly and decisively. And by providing CNN Max on the service, we're expanding our audience and our impact. The fact is what CNN does has never been more important or more impactful, and no one does it better.\nIn my view, we have the very best journalists in the business. Right now, we have over 70 people on the ground across Israel, Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon. And we've also got teams in Ukraine. They're in harm's way, working around the clock, reporting on these conflicts. And our teams bring not only their news reporting skills, but their deep knowledge of the regions, the geopolitical actors and the conflicts to bear in a way that really benefits the audience.\nIf you go to the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, Congress, Embassy Row, CNN is on. And it's on in homes across the U.S. and everywhere across the globe. Our new Chairman and CEO of CNN Worldwide, Mark Thompson, is in the seat now. He's visited nearly all of the offices and has already spent considerable time with leaders and employees. We couldn't be more thrilled to have Mark at the helm.\nCNN is coming off a strong month in October with our new prime-time programming lineup off to a very strong start and audience levels for the U.S. network up double digits year-over-year in key demos, while also outpacing the competition on both linear and digital platforms where CNN remains the #1 digital news outlet in the world. We're excited to build on this momentum.\nWe also launched sports on Max last month with the Bleacher Report Add-On Sports tier, which will include over 300 live sporting events annually, starting with the Major League Baseball postseason games, which were incredible, and now NHL and the NBA through the playoffs as well as NCAA Men's March Madness, U.S. soccer and more.\nIt's a huge advantage for us to have live sports and news, together with our bouquet of scripted entertainment, nonfiction and one of the best TV and motion picture libraries in the world. Not only does this make for an even better offering for consumers, as evidenced by the millions of subscribers who have enjoyed our sports and news offering in only the first few weeks, but it is also helping habituality, which is the most strongly correlated influence on churn. Similar to news, sports is bringing in an incremental and younger audience with Max viewers, on average, 12 years younger than traditional linear.\nWe'll be launching Max in Latin America in the first quarter of 2024, followed by the Nordics, Iberia, Netherlands and Central and Eastern Europe starting in the spring. The service will launch in France and Belgium in 2024 as well, our first entirely new markets. And in markets where Max will not yet be available, discovery+ and Max will be the only place where fans can get every minute of the Olympics in Paris next summer. Lots to look forward to.\nI also want to remind people that Max and HBO Max are still only available in markets that reach 45% of the world's broadband households, even excluding China, Russia and India. And while we will stay financially disciplined in our decision-making, we have significantly more growth to come over the next 2 to 3 years as we expand to over half of the world where we are not yet available.\nLooking across our full portfolio. Another area where we see particular opportunity is in gaming, where we have 11 world-class studios and are unique amongst our media peers as both a developer and publisher of games. Research has shown that Gen Z and Gen Alpha preferred gaming to any other form of entertainment, more than social media, more than watching television or listening to music, more than going to the movie theater. Games will be even more important to our fans in the future. And so having this asset in our arsenal is a critical differentiator and a real growth opportunity.\nAs a developer and publisher, we control quality and enjoy the full economic benefits of the games we produce as well as capturing the broader franchise benefits across the company. In 2023, we've released 2 of the industry's top 10 console games, including the #1 game released this year, Hogwarts Legacy, and we still have the Switch version to come launching next week. Our Harry Potter fans have immersed themselves in Hogwarts Legacy, playing more than 700 million hours to date. That engagement helps not only our games business, but also helps build and revitalize the entire Harry Potter franchise. And we know our fans want even more.\nWe've worked really hard on our games business for the last 1.5 years. And it's also a business where we have had a strong track record. Games has been a very successful and steady segment for Warner Bros. for over a decade. We've been profitable in each of the last 15 years, averaging more than $400 million in EBITDA the last 3 years alone. We believe games is a critical and very valuable asset for the company with a great deal of potential for growth.\nGames has consistently enjoyed among the highest ROIs of any of our businesses. And while we're smaller than some of the leading pure-play gaming companies, our operating margins are comparable to the best of the public companies. We're clearly punching above our weight, and we're just getting started.\nAnd similar to the leaders in the industry, we've led with multiple key franchises, each of which is a $1 billion gaming property: Harry Potter; Game of Thrones; DC, which is mainly Batman today; and Mortal Kombat whose most recent release, Mortal Kombat 1, has sold nearly 3 million copies since its launch in mid-September. So we've got the proven IP and franchises, the world-class studios and publishing talent, and we intend to continue to invest more capital and more resources into the business.\nOur focus is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console- and PC-based with 3 4-year release schedules to include more always-on game play through live services, multi-platform and free-to-play extensions with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms. Ultimately, we want to drive engagement and monetization of our longer cycles and at higher levels where for specific capabilities, we are currently under-scaled and see significant opportunity to generate greater post-purchase revenue.\nBottom line, we've come a long way in 19 months and have built a very solid foundation for growth. I'm energized by what we've done in such a short period of time and even more so in where we are headed as a company. As I said at the outset, our industry is undergoing great disruption. And while there are some key factors that are out of our control like the economy and the impacts of the strike, we do have a very strong handle on those areas of our businesses that we can directly influence.\nClearly, there is still much more to be done, and our sleeves are rolled up and we're hard at work. I'm as confident as ever that we have the greatest assets, the strongest creative team and the absolute resolve to make Warner Bros. Discovery the very best it could be.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gunnar, and he'll walk you through the financials. Gunnar?\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nChief Financial Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm very pleased with the strong progress that WBD continues to make across a number of fronts, particularly in light of the obstacles we and the industry have had to navigate, namely geopolitical and economic uncertainty and strike-related constraints. We are operating with both greater precision and focus as well as increased flexibility and adaptability.\nTo that point, we've turned in another solid set of operating results as demonstrated by 22% ex-FX EBITDA growth, a year-on-year increase of over $500 million and very substantial free cash flow of nearly $2.1 billion. As a reminder, this is after our roughly $900 million of semiannual cash interest payment. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have now delivered $5.3 billion of free cash flow, a remarkable improvement in only 19 months as Warner Bros. Discovery, particularly in the light of where we started.\nThis quarter, we repaid another $2.4 billion of debt, enabling us to address nearly all floating rate debt that was issued to finance the transaction. In October, we further repaid an additional $600 million of the term loan, leaving only $550 million of this [ variable ] and lately higher interest rate debt and bringing total debt repayments since closing of the transaction to nearly $12 billion.\nWe will continue to reduce debt as we generate cash, and net leverage will be comfortably below 4x at year-end, as previously guided. I am proud that WBD will exit this year with a fundamentally improved financial profile as compared to the beginning of this year regarding command and control, cost structure, profitability and cash flow generation and the balance sheet.\nBriefly on our Q3 segment results, which I will, as usual, discuss on an ex-FX basis. Overall Studios revenues increased 3%. Barbie, the highest grossing movie of 2023 thus far and the highest grossing movie in Warner Bros. history, was the primary driver of segment revenue. Games was also a contributor, which benefited from the release of Mortal Kombat 1 in September.\nOf course, weighing on this was the impact of the strikes on the production and delivery of TV content as TV revenues declined significantly, offsetting strong films and games performance. We also faced tough comparisons against certain content licensing deals last year. Finally, segment EBITDA decreased 6%, in part also due to greater marketing support behind film and game releases.\nAt Networks, total revenue and EBITDA were impacted by a modest decline in distribution revenue and the continued challenging advertising marketplace, predominantly here in the U.S., where the market has continued to be weaker than we had hoped, while international markets on balance remain more stable in comparison.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we will be helped by the strong deals we secured for the upfront year 2023-'24 and improving ratings trends on some of our core networks. Taken together, while the market environment continues to be soft, we are expecting an incremental improvement of our Networks segment ad sales in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to D2C. We ended Q3 with over 95 million subscribers, representing a modest sequential loss, largely as a result of an extraordinarily light content slate and some expected decline in the overlapping Discovery and Max subscribers. Revenues increased 5% as our core subscriber-related revenues, distribution and advertising grew 5% and 29%, respectively, while content decreased 17%.\nDistribution growth was primarily due to price increases in the U.S. and certain international markets as well as a more favorable subscriber mix. As noted previously, wholesale subscribers, which have been declining, tend to have lower ARPUs than retail subscribers.\nD2C adjusted EBITDA was positive $111 million, representing a $745 million year-over-year improvement, helped by both revenue growth and OpEx improvements with costs down 21%. Our D2C team has done a remarkable job improving the quality and financial profile of our streaming business.\nOnly 19 months into the combined operation as Warner Bros. Discovery and a few months after the launch of Max, we are now on track to at least breakeven or even profitable across the D2C segment, a swing of approximately $2 billion versus last year and very well ahead of our own plan. This is an incredibly valuable asset and provides a strong vantage point for our path to long-term sustainable growth.\nTurning briefly to consolidated results. Revenues increased 1% to nearly $10 billion, while adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to $2.97 billion. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA has improved by nearly $1.2 billion year-over-year on a pro forma basis even with pro forma Networks advertising revenue now down nearly $1 billion in the first 9 months of this year and the headwind from the ongoing work stoppage in Hollywood. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA for the full year will be in the $10.5 billion to $11 billion range.\nFactors impacting where within that range we end naturally include the tone of the scatter market in the U.S., the performance of our 3 remaining feature film releases in December as well as the timing of content licensing.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was a positive $2.1 billion versus a negative $200 million in the prior year quarter, which recall was the first full quarter of the combined company. The nearly $2.3 billion positive swing year-over-year in this quarter alone illustrates the meaningful strides that we have made on all fronts. Admittedly, this swing also includes some benefits from the strikes, though the vast majority of the improvement has been the result of our transformation efforts and relentless focus on efficiencies across the enterprise.\nFrom finding deeper cost synergies with more than $3 billion of incremental cost synergies flowing through this year to driving working capital improvements and far greater discipline on capital allocation, I continue to believe we're still very much in the early stages of realizing the full benefit of many of these initiatives.\nI expect full year free cash flow to be similar to the trailing 12 months at the end of Q3, i.e., in this $5.3 billion range, give or take, with some further strike-related benefits balanced against the tough comp in Q4 free cash flow last year when we converted nearly 100% of our EBITDA to free cash flow.\nLooking ahead to 2024 and with some preliminary thoughts from early-stage budgeting, I'd like to provide an initial perspective on a couple of points. On the positive side, I continue to be confident in our ability to further drive and maintain cost discipline. By the end of this year, we will have realized over $4 billion of cost synergies, and we will have already implemented initiatives to deliver more than $5 billion through 2024 and beyond, as I have detailed in the past.\nSecond, with our strong cash generation, significantly reduced leverage, the outstanding results our games business has delivered, the turn to profitability of our streaming business and the clear value in our ability to drive franchise returns across the company, we see more and more opportunity for investing in sustainable profitable growth.\nAs David alluded to and as we shared with you over the last quarter, as we are planning for 2024, we are examining ways to reinvest at a slightly faster pace into these growth avenues. This will be most relevant in areas such as marketing support for Max in the U.S. and in conjunction with launches in Latin America and EMEA, including new markets, particularly given the high-profile release schedule Casey has assembled and the Olympic Games in Paris next summer.\nOur disciplined framework centered on rigorous analysis of subscriber acquisition costs, customer lifetime value and return on investment will firmly guide this process and support continued traction in revenue growth while maintaining our focus on longer-term segment profitability [ targets ].\nOn the challenging side, it is becoming increasingly clear now that much like 2023, 2024 will have its share of complexity, particularly as it relates to the possibility of continued sluggish advertising trends. To that point, while streaming advertising remains robust, the state of the overall linear ad market during the second half of this year has been disappointing. And looking ahead, while it is early, the timing of an ad recovery is currently difficult for any of us to predict with any conviction.\nAnd finally, as we begin to formulate the initial framework of our TV production business getting back to work into 2024, there's simply a lot we don't know yet. While we have every confidence that this will eventually ride itself throughout the next year, and there should be an eventual tailwind from the end of the work stoppage, this is an evolving process, and there is a real risk at this point that some negative financial impact of the strike will extend into 2024 to some extent.\nHere's what these factors mean as we look ahead. We will exit 2023 with great momentum and leverage reduction. We have taken significant financial and operating risk off the table over the last year. And we are fully committed to our gross leverage target range of 2.5 to 3x adjusted EBITDA. That said, taking together the factors just mentioned for an early view on 2024, it is unlikely from today's perspective that we will hit our target leverage range by the end of 2024 without a meaningful recovery of the TV ad market.\nWe remain hopeful. Indeed, we expect to continue to generate very meaningful free cash flow. Key building blocks to consider for 2024 free cash flow remain: number one, around $1 billion tailwind of cash costs to achieve largely going away; number two, lower cash interest expense; and number three, further progress in AR- and AP-driven working capital initiatives, offset by the potential headwinds I've noted, most importantly, a potential further decline in U.S. advertising and, of course, the return to a normal content capital spend as well as the incremental growth investments I noted earlier.\nI remain very comfortable with our leverage and our delevering path, as underpinned by the strength of our free cash flow conversion. Looking at our maturities over the next 5 years, the average amount of debt coming due is below $3 billion per year. Our debt stack is long-dated and low cost with a nearly 15-year average maturity and a weighted average coupon of a little over 4.6%. With the vast majority of our remaining debt being fixed, we will be largely insulated from rising rates and, in fact, will have increasing opportunity to retire debt at a significant discount.\nAs I stated at the beginning of my remarks, in a very compressed time frame, we have made very significant progress as an organization in what remains a very complex and disruptive period in the industry. And our transformative efforts have better positioned us to compete, to respond to industry dynamics and to participate with strong operating leverage when the macroeconomic and ad market backdrop eventually turn positive.\nAnd with the initial phase of integration work largely behind us and the free cash flow engine continuing to fire on all cylinders, we are more focused than ever on driving sustainable and profitable growth that will enhance the financial and competitive profile of the company over the next several years with real upside to shareholder value.\nThank you again for your time this morning. And now David, JB and I are happy to take your questions.",

Discovery Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may now begin.\n\nAndrew T. Slabin\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 Earnings Call. With me today is David Zaslav, President and CEO; Gunnar Wiedenfels, our CFO; and JB Perrette, CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will include forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private is Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements include comments regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nIn providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. A copy of our Q2 earnings release, trending schedule and accompanying slide deck will be available on our website at ir.wbd.com.\nAnd with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Discovery, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. When we merged the 2 legacy companies and formed Warner Bros. Discovery 16 months ago, we did so with the ambition to be the greatest media and entertainment company in the world. And we continue to carry out our attack plan in all areas of the business.\nWhen you look back at what we said we would do, we're doing it. We said we were going to reimagine the company for the future and focus on free cash flow and delevering the balance sheet, and we are. This quarter alone, we generated over $1.7 billion in free cash flow, and we're anticipating about the same in Q3. This is the result of the hard work of our teams,who have been bold, decisive and disciplined. We've restructured our businesses for the future to position them to drive both profitability and long-term growth. And the results have been significant.\nAnd as a further sign of our confidence in our free cash flow capability, this morning we announced a tender for up to $2.7 billion of our short-dated debt. We paid down $1.6 billion in debt in Q2, bringing our total debt retirement, before today's tender, to $9 billion since the merger. And as we've said, we expect to be comfortably below 4x levered by the end of the year, firmly within the investment-grade rating by midpoint next year,and at our target of 2.5 to 3x gross leverage by the close of 2024.\nWith our free cash flow and leverage targets in sight, we are better positioned to lean into top line growth opportunities across the company, and that's increasingly been our focus, starting with direct consumer. We said we were going to build a strong, sustainable direct-to-consumer strategy focused on profitable growth as opposed to chasing subs at any cost. And we are. In fact, we continue to track way ahead of our own financial projections. And as we told you last quarter, we expect our U.S. direct-to-consumer business to be profitable for the year 2023, this year, a year ahead of our prior guidance.\nIn fact, our global direct-to-consumer business was roughly breakeven in Q2 and modestly EBITDA positive for the first half of this year. And our U.S. direct-to-consumer business is generating healthy EBITDA, which is helping to offset international losses, even with the product development costs and sizable marketing campaign associated with the launch of Max. The migration to Max has gone exceedingly well with the overwhelming majority of subscribers in the U.S. successfully transferred.\nWhile we have seen some expected subscriber disruption, we have experienced lower-than-expected churn throughout this process. And by all measures, the third-party metrics, the consumer experience is top notch. The most important metric at this stage, only 2 months into our launch, is the amount of time people are spending watching our content. And we're seeing early and encouraging signs of stronger engagement.\nAnd they're not only watching for longer, also exploring new genres, adventure and discovery, true crime, home improvement and other nonfiction content. The mix of blockbuster originals from HBO, together with the nourishment and great personalities found on discovery+ content, makes for a very compelling content proposition. Truly something for everyone. We're preparing to launch Max in markets around the globe over the next year plus.\nThere is significant opportunity internationally in markets we have yet to attack. And importantly, the platform now has full capability to deliver live programming. We'll have more to say about that soon. While Max will be a cornerstone of our company's growth, we also see great potential across a number of our other businesses.\nOne is gaming. We're the only company among our peers scaled in gaming. Next up is Mortal Combat 1, the highly anticipated new title in the acclaimed 30-year franchise set for release next month. This comes on the heels of the success of Hogwarts Legacy, which is still the biggest game of 2023. And there's more planned, including the one of Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch in November, just in time for the holidays. More broadly, we are positioning our gaming business to be a much more strategic piece of our IP and consumer engagement puzzle, and we're investing accordingly.\nAt Warner Bros. Discovery, we're one of the largest makers and sellers of content in the world. And it's quality content people want to watch. We had an industry-leading 181 Emmy nominations, including 127 for HBO and Max, the most of any network for platform. As a critical supplier of some of the most highly resonant television series, we are adding incremental asset value to our world-class portfolio. And as we window that content around the globe, we expect to continue to see a tailwind of growth in our production business.\nLikewise, we have real ambition for the future of our motion picture business in the wake of the creative tour de force and global cultural phenomenon that is Barbie. While the studio's performance has been challenged in recent years and they've clearly under-earned their potential, we are taking meaningful steps with respect to the creative direction of both Warner Bros. Pictures Group and DC. And a key facet of this strategy will be to lean into some of our great underutilized storytelling IP. It's been 10 years since we made a stand-alone Superman movie, and 9 years since the last Lord of the Rings, for example.\nFor many years, the secret to Warner Bros. profitability was tenpole films. They'd make 2 to 3 of them together with a slate of new original content, and that was the winning formula. We too believe in the power of tentpoles, featuring great IP recognized by people everywhere in the world. our core strength, and we intend to get back to doing what we know works. While we've still got lots to do, we're very optimistic about the growth potential of this business.\nThe culmination of what we're winning at both our film and television studios is further bolstering what is already among the industry's biggest film and TV libraries. And this asset offers a wealth opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms as well as others. It's a mainstay of our business to create great content and window it through, creating value in each window. And as you would expect, a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we'll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don't lose anything by growing the pie.\nThe fact is licensing some library content to other SVOD platforms, like Netflix or Amazon, as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business. We're expanding our audience while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, To optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.\nWe're also a global leader in sports, including great sports rights from many of the top leagues in the U.S. that, in many cases, run through 2028 and beyond. We have the best digital and social sports platform for younger fans in Bleacher Report, and we have significant digital rights in the U.S. that we're not currently deploying but plan to in the future, and that has a real chance to create meaningful strategic value.\nWe've had some good success in Europe and Latin America with layering sports into streaming with various business models. And this experience is informing our view on how to best deploy these sports rights here in the U.S. Our recent venture with BT in the U.K. is a great example, having merged BT Sport with Eurosport U.K. What is now called TNT Sports is available on both linear and streaming, and bundled with discovery+, our current streaming entertainment product in that market. We believe there's significant opportunity in the streaming space for sports, and we look forward to leaning into this incremental growth avenue.\nUnderpinning all of the work we are doing is our strong commitment to operating Warner Bros. Discovery as one company. Consider Barbie, early this year we created an attack plan for the summer of Barbie in anticipation of the launch of the movie, which broke records and is now approaching $1 billion in global box office. Over the last 6 months, every area of the company has played a part in promoting this great film. From the 4-part series, Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge on HGTV, which premiered in the U.S. to 4 million viewers, and was then broadcast across 146 countries to Food Networks' Barbie-themed Summer Baking Championship, to Turner Sports' sneak peek of the film during the NBA Eastern Conference finals, it has truly been a one-company effort.\nThis is one of the big differentiators and super strengths of Warner Bros. Discovery, where a property or a title can benefit from eventizing it across our global platforms. We're able to put the full weight and power of all of our diverse media assets, domestically and globally, behind it to drive awareness and excitement. And the result is truly unmatched.\nOf course, in light of the cyclical and secular headwinds facing the industry, we are working through some challenges. With respect to linear, the fact is we have a uniquely different hand, one that we believe makes us more resilient. On any given night, we reach an average of 1/3 of all cable viewers. And it's a great platform for driving our brands and products as we saw with promotions from Max, Barbie and Shark Week. Our ability to make unscripted content quickly inexpensively and tailored to viewers' preferences is also a key differentiator. And we believe this optionality provides us with greater longevity and sustainability.\nAt the same time, we've worked really hard on driving efficiency and productivity, enhancing our margins recognizing that we need to do that because the overall business is facing secular decline. That said, it's still generating real meaningful free cash flow that we are able to use to fund growth.\nWhile the linear business is being further challenged by the soft ad sales market, we do see cause for optimism. We've nearly completed the U.S. upfront, and our volume is up and our price levels are consistent with prior year, a very good result in a tough market.\nOne more thing before turning it over to Gunnar. At Warner Bros. Discovery, we're in the business of storytelling. Our goal is to tell great stories, stories with the power to entertain and when, we're at our best, inspire, with stories that come to life on screens big and small. And we cannot do any of that without the entirety of the creative community, the great creative community.\nWithout the writers, directors, editors, producers, actors, the whole line crew, our job is to enable and empower them to do their best work. We're hopeful that all sides will get back to the negotiating room soon and that these strikes get resolved in a way that the writers and actors feel they are fairly compensated and their efforts and contributions are fully valued.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gunnar, and he'll take you through the specifics of the quarter. Gunnar?\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We have been hard at work at WBD, and much of our focus over the past 15 months has been on driving thoughtful efficiencies, merger-related and otherwise, and on implementing a cash flow mindset across the whole company.\nOur second quarter results demonstrate the fruits of that labor. Our disciplined transformation efforts have not only been a key factor in our ability to drive financial outcomes but they have also made us ever more confident in the strategic vision we presented early on following our merger. Simply put, we have begun to conduct our business fundamentally differently. And some of what we identified very early on as a near and long-term potential, we are beginning to realize. These are durable performance improvements borne out of true change, and we see a lot more opportunity.\nTo that end, adjusted EBITDA grew 23% in Q2, marking the second consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is now up more than $600 million despite a persistently challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We have accelerated the delivery of our transformation initiatives, where appropriate, and have already delivered more than $2 billion in incremental cost synergies thus far this year. This has allowed us to offset the impact of the market challenges and grow profits, while at the same time, funding many foundational investment opportunities.\nOur transformation team is still very much focused on generating new initiatives and, based on the successful implementation I am seeing and the size of the funnel, I am confident that we'll achieve $4 billion in total synergies much sooner than previously thought and now see a clear path to achieving $5 billion or more through 2024 and beyond.\nOur second quarter free cash flow of over $1.7 billion is strong proof of these efforts. Clearly, it was a healthy number and nicely ahead of our expectations. I am incredibly proud of this result, not only because it allows us to continue to quickly delever, but perhaps, more importantly, I'm excited because this outperformance is coming through across a number of components of our cash flow statement, and I view this as true cash focus becoming evident across the company.\nKey factors of the outperformance were, number one, slightly better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA. Number two, improvements across virtually all elements of our working capital and other below-the-line items, part of a very long runway of opportunity that we are beginning to chip away at. Number three, the closing of the gap between cash spend and amortization, partly due to shifts in the timing of production and partly as a result of implementing our new content strategy initiated last year.\nNumber four, modest cash savings from the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, which we estimate were in the low $100 million range during the quarter. We also absorbed $200 million of cash restructuring and integration-related expense during the quarter, in line with our expectations. We repaid over $1.6 billion of debt, $1.1 billion of the term loan and over $500 million of notes. As you saw, we launched a tender offer this morning for up to $2.7 billion of notes that are maturing through the first half of 2024.\nOur net leverage came down significantly this quarter and is now at 4.6x. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we remain focused on debt pay down and have a clear path to net leverage nicely below 4x at the end of the year, and reiterate our expectation to achieve target leverage of 2.5x growth by the end of 2024.\nTurning now briefly to the segments, which I will discuss as always on a constant currency basis. Starting with D2C. I'm very encouraged with the results that effectively breakeven EBITDA and quite a bit better than we expected, notwithstanding the significant investments in the development and marketing of our new Max platform in the U.S. Q2 nicely demonstrates the underlying traction and efficiency from the integration of legacy D2C operations and organization.\nI do want to call out, while we saw growth across all 3 revenue streams, content was the standout, helped by the timing of license deals. And while selling content to third parties has been and will be a core element of our company-wide operating model, we would expect some smoothing out of content licensing in the second half of the year. We saw a sequential net subscriber loss of $1.8 million in Q2.\nAs expected, trends were impacted by overlapping subscriber bases between Max and discovery+, expected churn from the end of some key tentpole series, such as The Last of Us and Succession; and wholesale declines, including the unwinding of some very low ARPU international wholesale distribution deals that were struck under the prior strategy that prioritized subscribers over ARPU, profitability and value.\nAnd with respect to the overlapping subscriber base, we did see several hundred thousand subs churn off during the quarter, meaningfully less than we had anticipated. And while we do expect to see some more elevated churn on discovery+, we also see engagement patterns consistent with what we saw prior to Max launch, making us optimistic that our strategy to keep offering these 2 products was the right one for customers and for our business. Our streaming team really did an outstanding job with this transition.\nWe continue to see traction on the streaming advertising opportunity, supported by gains in ad-light subscribers, early initiatives on HBO and Max Originals and increased engagement. While the overall advertising market remains soft, we see the streaming and advertising opportunity well positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds over the long term. This is particularly true against the backdrop of the enormous value of some of our iconic shows for advertisers who, in the past, have no access to this inventory.\nWe remain focused on further scaling this segment of our offering, and the relaunch of Max will certainly be a driver, both here in the U.S. and later abroad. I am proud of the meaningful strides we made in the first half of the year and see D2C as an important contributor to total company profit growth year-over-year in the second half.\nTurning to studios. The studios' performance has clearly been inconsistent. Our box office results in Q2 underperformed our expectations, which weighed on financial results. And it's ironic to have to say that given how incredibly successful Barbie has been impacting Q3, of course, not Q2. Unpacking this a bit, overall content revenues declined 25% due to, number one, the slate, as I mentioned. As well as the timing of production of certain TV series and fewer CW Series orders following the Nexstar transaction.\nNumber two, lower internal sales to networks and D2C, in part resulting from the more disciplined content investment and programming approach we've implemented, such as exiting direct to Max movies or certain scripted series on linear, for which we felt ratings did not justify the investments. Please note, these lower revenues are offset in lower eliminations on the group level but impacted segment level revenue.\nAnd number three, finally, in gaming, The LEGO Star Wars game was released in the second quarter last year, which created a tough comp for this year. Looking ahead, we're naturally delighted with the performance of Barbie thus far, which is now approaching $1 billion in global box office, and we're excited about its prospects through its remaining monetization window.\nFor the remainder of our feature films this year as well as Warner Bros. television inductions, release dates and performance expectations are naturally fluid given the ongoing strikes, and we will evaluate our options and update the market accordingly. But it is possible we will see greater variability against our forecast.\nTurning to networks. Advertising decreased 13%. As we called out last quarter, we faced tough comparisons as we did not have the NCAA Final 4 and championship games this year. And although we did have the Stanley Cup finals for the first time, the net impact of these 2 sporting events was an approximate 200 basis point headwind. Adjusting for this, we did see underlying sequential improvement.\nI would characterize the broader tone of the marketplace thus far in Q3 as similar to that in Q2, certainly here in the U.S., while international markets are broadly a touch stronger. That said, as David mentioned earlier, we are making strong progress on our upfront deals. Key callouts from my perspective are, number one, linear volume expected to be up, with pricing on balance pretty consistent with the prior year. Number two, D2C volume is up more than 50% in the marketplace in which CPMs were positioned to drive scale, for us as much as for the broader market.\nWhile visibility overall remains limited and the scatter market inconsistent, we expect continued modest sequential improvement through the end of the year and forecast global networks advertising revenues will decrease in the high single-digit range during the second half of the year, with Q4 sequentially better than Q3, which is overall meaningfully worse than our forecast from earlier in the year.\nDistribution revenues decreased 1% with a modest improvement versus last quarter as we continue to be pleased with the pricing and tiering of our networks and renewals, represented by their importance to both traditional and virtual bundles. Before wrapping up the segment discussion, I'd like to offer an update on the AT&T Sports Nets.\nI am very pleased to say that we have been working diligently with the respective leagues and teams to formulate a plan to exit the RSN business in a manner that minimizes the disruption to teams and their fans. We expect each of the networks will be sold or operation seized by the end of the year. While we've positioned these to operate at adjusted EBITDA breakeven, this business generated nearly $400 million of revenues in 2022 and skewed heavily towards distribution revenues.\nAs these networks are sold or wound down over the next few months, we expect a modest impact to Q3 distribution and advertising revenues, with a more meaningful impact in Q4 and into 2024.\nTurning to guidance and our outlook for the year. Let me start with our most important financial metric, free cash flow. For Q3, I expect us to again generate free cash flow in the $1.7 billion ballpark, reflecting similar underlying trends as in Q2, with sequentially larger savings from the strikes as well as the success of Barbie, notwithstanding the roughly $900 million of semiannual interest payments.\nAnd based on this outlook, the health of the underlying free cash flow drivers and further opportunities in the pipeline, I see full year free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. This also assumes cash restructuring and integration-related costs for this year of roughly $1.2 billion, which is a couple of hundred million more than our prior expectations.\nFor adjusted EBITDA, I am now assuming we'll settle towards the low end of our target range of $11 billion to $11.5 billion. The key drivers for the final outcome will be centered around ad sales, D2C profit growth and contributions from the Studio segment. Let me provide some puts and takes.\nFirst, the timing and magnitude of a potential ad market recovery continued to be the most important driver of upside and downside to our results. Second, the D2C segment has been a driver of our year-over-year EBITDA improvement, and we expect that to continue, helped by efficiency gains and top line benefits. We see segment EBITDA losses of no more than a couple of hundred million dollars for the full year 2023.\nThird, uncertainty in the studio segment has increased with the dual strikes. This may have implications for the timing and performance of the remainder of the film slate as well as our ability to produce and deliver content. And while we are hoping for a fast resolution, our modeling assumes a return to work date in early September. Through the strikes run through the end of the year, I would expect several hundred million dollars of incremental upside to our free cash flow guidance, and some incremental downside for adjusted EBITDA.\nWhen I take a step back, notwithstanding the factors influencing the broader landscape, I am more and more convinced that the dedicated work of the leadership team and efforts throughout the company, marked by a meaningful shift in mindset about how to manage this company, is starting to pay dividends. I believe our financial results this quarter speak volumes about this change.\nI am very confident in the trajectory of our delevering and debt pay down, the benefits of which will increasingly allow us to turn our dedication and focus to support further growth initiatives to ensure long-term, sustainable and profitable growth ahead.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator and take your questions.",

BD dot com and with that I am pleased to turn the call over to David.\n\nHello, everyone and thank you for joining us.\n\nWe've had a very busy and productive year, thus far.\n\nWhile we have lots more to do and more to attack.\n\nWe're aggressively doing just that the diversified nature of our company continues to provide a strong foundation that enables us to weather challenging environments like the one we're in.\n\nAnd still generate meaningful free cash flow.\n\nWe expected the marketplace to be challenged.\n\nAnd with clear eyes, we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to generate free cash flow.\n\nAnd this year below four times Levered.\n\nWith our streaming service as a tailwind.\n\nGunnar will take you through the specifics.\n\nBut for some perspective.\n\nOn a trailing 12 month basis, we generated $2 1 billion in free cash flow.\n\nEven after absorbing $1 2 billion in cash restructuring and merger related costs.\n\nOkay.\n\nTurning to the quarter.\n\nWhile Q1 is seasonally our weakest and we saw a challenging revenue headwinds mainly on the linear TV studio sides. We are on track to achieve this year's financial targets and.\n\nAnd we see a number of positive proof points emerging across our businesses with direct to consumer perhaps the most prominent.\n\nWe have a strong command and control of our DTC business, we made a meaningful turn this quarter generating $50 million in EBITDA.\n\nAnd adding $1 6 million new subscribers and we feel really good about the trajectory we're on.\n\nWe now expect our U S DTC business to not only break even ahead of schedule.\n\nBut to be profitable for the year 2023 this year.\n\nA year ahead of our guidance.\n\nAnd it's worth, noting HBO, Max and discovery plus are still only available to less than half of the global screaming market.\n\nSo there were significant runway ahead of us and we are attacking this opportunity.\n\nMax launches here in the U S on may 23rd.\n\nWith Latin America to follow later, this year and markets in EMEA and APAC in 2024.\n\nService looks terrific.\n\nAnd as a broad and compelling offering for everyone in the family.\n\nWe anticipate having a healthy pipeline of our new content added to Max monthly.\n\nAnd recognizing that one of the real advantages we have as a company.\n\nThe strength and depth of our franchises, including Harry Potter for a decade game of Thrones and DC.\n\nWe are delivering on our commitment to reinvigorate the best of them with new exciting stories for fans around the world.\n\nWhile it launched the Max offering and will feature the full range of entertainment.\n\nThis is really just the beginning.\n\nWe are actively working on options to expand our lineup to include news and sports.\n\nAcknowledging that this live programming has the power to keep consumers coming back for more and staying longer.\n\nWe look forward to sharing further details with you in the months ahead.\n\nAs part of our marketing campaign.\n\nUnder our one company strategy, we are taking full advantage of the range of available media assets companywide.\n\nTo include our U S cable networks and our popular digital outlets like Bleacher report CNN Dot com.\n\nWe're planning to rollout Max in most key markets around the world.\n\nIn an effort to reach the broadest possible audience and in keeping with our second strategic pillar .\n\nTo monetize our content in the most financially advantageous ways.\n\nWe are also going to continue pursuing other licensing and output deals in markets, where either that makes better strategic and financial sense.\n\nAll where HBO Max isn't currently available.\n\nOften with paths to eventually launch Max when we're ready.\n\nOur recent deals in Canada, and India for example, a very lucrative with no expenses against them.\n\nWe already own that content.\n\nHow we serve consumers is important.\n\nThe wealth of our media assets brands, and IP and our ability to deliver diverse high quality content that viewers want to watch and we will pay for is what truly differentiates us and makes the opportunity we have to drive real value so compelling.\n\nIt's the reason we brought these two companies together.\n\nThis year, we celebrate Warner brothers 100th anniversary.\n\nThis studio has historically been the crown jewel of the industry and we are working hard to rebuild it to its former glory.\n\nWe're driving meaningful creative momentum with more and more of the most talented storytellers in the business choosing to partner with us.\n\nOn the film side after a very challenging year at the box office.\n\nWe're excited and optimistic about the slate of movies coming including June two.\n\nBarbie and Dcs blue beetle and the flash.\n\nWe screen the flash its cinema Con last week and early reactions have been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nWe are committed not just to expanding the size of our film slate next year, but even more important we are committed to making great high quality films that have an impact.\n\nAs I've said, many times and we believe it.\n\nIt's not about how much it's about how good.\n\nOne of the real strengths of our company is the diversity of our storytelling.\n\nAnd it means centennial year, we're especially excited to be reinvigorating, our feature animation business, which has a long history and a wealth of great IP.\n\n, the former head of Dreamworks animation.\n\nhas taken the helm of our film animation group.\n\nHard at work together with Mike and Pam developing a new slate while at Dreamworks Bill all of them saw hip productions, including Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, how to train your dragon and the crudes.\n\nHe is a great addition to our all star team.\n\nOn the interactive side, we're also seeing continuing momentum in our gaming business.\n\nlegacy has amassed more than $1 billion retail sales.\n\nOver 15 million units sold worldwide to date.\n\nAnd today the team is launching the game on the Playstation four and Xbox One platforms. This is our fifth $1 billion plus gaming franchise alongside mortal combat game of Thrones, a Lego games in D C.\n\nAnd there's lots more games coming including Hogwash legacy on switch later this year.\n\nAnother area, we're very focused on is AD sales.\n\nWhile our results for Q1 continue to reflect the current soft ad market.\n\nWe are optimistic for a gradual improvement and an eventual upturn in the second half of the year.\n\nAnd a couple of weeks, we'll host our upfront.\n\nLast year's upfront was right on the heels of closing of our merger and.\n\nAnd since then we've refined our sales organization and our approach.\n\nAnd the team is executing against what we believe is a strong strategy.\n\nWe're also advantaged by the diversity and strength of our AD supported platforms in particular sports and streaming are two key areas for this year's market.\n\nWe are extremely well positioned in both.\n\nLooking ahead to the next couple of months, we'll host the MBA Eastern Conference finals in a few weeks given the four teams in the mix. It is shaping up to be a great series.\n\nAnd in June we've got the Stanley Cup finals on TNT.\n\nThe first time ever that one of the four major professional team sports will air its final series solely on a cable network, we're very excited about that.\n\nOn the direct to consumer side, we now have more than 15 foundational advertising partners purely on HBO originals, something you couldn't buy just three months ago and a truly unique offering for brands. The Mercedes Benz title sponsorship of succession is a good example.\n\nAnd our first of its kind opportunity.\n\nThe combination of impactful campaigns and.\n\nIn a limited AD watching experience for consumers.\n\nOn average AD supported subscribers, we will see one to two minutes of ads per hour.\n\nAh represents a real win win for all involved.\n\nWhen you consider the quality of the service the attractive price point and the limited amount of advertising, it's simply can't be beat.\n\nWe're also providing huge value to advertisers by creating these Sunday night Buzzy shows like Euphoria game of Thrones, the last of US and of course succession.\n\nThese shared experiences enable advertisers to build the desired reach quickly.\n\nThis is expected to be a big year for news as well with the presidential cycle kicking off soon.\n\nWe anticipate real growth out of C. N N, who will be selling heavily into the upfront for town halls primaries and conventions.\n\nNeedless to say, we've got a lot of irons in the fire in this busy year is looking to get even busier.\n\nWe are driving leverage down generating free cash flow and continuing to build a sustainable business for the long term.\n\nAnd as the macro environment begins to improve we believe given the efficiencies we've put in place command and control and our diversified portfolio of media assets storytelling IP and talent.\n\nWe are strongly positioned to achieve even higher free cash flow and EBITDA heights, and ultimately meaningfully grow shareholder value.\n\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Gunnar and he'll take you through the financials and the specifics of the quarter and whats ahead Gunnar.\n\nThank you David and good morning on.\n\nOn balance I'm very pleased with where we are and very encouraged by the progress of our priority initiatives, which are all moving forward as planned.\n\nWe generated 12% constant currency EBITDA growth this quarter, a strong starting point for the year and also the first quarter of EBITDAR growth since closing the merger.\n\nI remain confident in our guidance of adjusted EBITDA in the range of low to mid $11 billion.\n\nAnd one third to one half conversion to free cash flow.\n\nWith net leverage at the end of 2023 comfortably below four times.\n\nAs always there are a number of moving pieces in this quarter is no exception, so I'd like to address the key puts and takes impacting our results and outlook.\n\nStarting with D to C.\n\nAs we enter this next leg of the journey kicking off with the launch of Max on May 23rd we're already very pleased with the traction we are seeing having generated $50 million of EBITDA this quarter.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, we're continuing to see improvements across key operating kpis.\n\nSuch as in our retention metrics. We also added $1 6 million subscribers globally in part due to the strong creative success off the last of us.\n\nWe've driven a healthy amount of lasting efficiency improvement across this business through the initial phase of D to C integration in fact, DTC operating expenses were down over $760 million or 24%, excluding FX on a pro forma basis in the first quarter.\n\nAll of this now provides much greater clarity on the path forward to establishing a sustainable platform setup for dynamic and profitable growth for years to come.\n\nAs we relaunch here in the U S and.\n\nAnd plan additional launches later in 'twenty, three and into 'twenty. Four we will continue to be guided by a focus on prudent and rational investment.\n\nAdditionally, we benefited from greater insight into the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing efforts over the last 12 months.\n\nAnd we've seen that we can do more with less as.\n\nAs JP noted during our precedent we will undertake the largest marketing campaign in the company's history to support the launch of Max. This was of course anticipated in our internal budget and guidance.\n\nWe will continue to focus on driving efficiencies throughout our D to C. Non content cost structure as we launched around the world and get more and more of our digital products on a common platform as such we expect the DTC segment to continue to show improvement with peak EBITDA losses for the year in the second quarter and when I say peak.\n\nI'm talking around $300 million in yourself.\n\nIn fact, we are tracking ahead of our profitability target and now expect to be profitable in the U S. On a full year basis. This year that is a full year ahead of our original plan of breakeven in 2024.\n\nAnd I remain ever confident in our outlook of generating $1 billion or more of profitability in 2025 globally.\n\nFinally, I'd like to remind you about the approximately 4 million overlapping subscribers between HBO, Max and discovery plus consistent with what we outlined for you last summer.\n\nWhile we intend to keep discovery plus going as a standalone product. We expect a large portion of these 4 million subscribers will likely turn off discovery plus the exact cadence of course being unclear at this time, while we do expect a fair amount of it to happen in the first few months after launch.\n\nTurning briefly to the other segments of our portfolio starting with the advertising market.\n\nAs expected we did see a modest sequential improvement in Q1, when adjusting for the Olympics.\n\nWe do see this underlying trend continuing into Q2 on a like for like basis that.\n\nThat is after accounting for the NCAA men's final four last year and the Stanley Cup finals. This year, which combined will account for a net 200 basis points headwind the global networks advertising revenue.\n\nWhile we see this as encouraging visibility remains limited and the improvement is gradual.\n\nThough the market remains challenged we are cautiously optimistic, particularly coming into the upfront, which will take place over the next couple of months with discussions ongoing we will soon have a much better handle on Q4, and the 2023 2024 season.\n\nWe see a particularly strong advertising opportunity on Max both with respect to the more traditional ads on shows like friends and Big Bang theory, as well as the very impactful in high profile.\n\n.\n\nMax originals.\n\nYou will hear lots more about this at our upfront presentation in a few weeks.\n\nRecall this really only kicked off in February and were moving slowly and deliberately destroying a high quality rich advertising experience and we see significant further upside for this product line, particularly when the advertising market.\n\nBriefly on our international markets on the whole they continue to perform relatively better led by key markets like Poland, The Nordics and Italy, with the UK, Germany, and Brazil on the weaker side, though as in the U S. There is limited visibility.\n\nIn the studio segment.\n\nThere are a number of moving pieces that will be helpful to unpack, obviously hardware as legacy was the key driver here, having performed amazingly well. It is thus far the best selling game across the industry with over $1 billion in retail sales and it is on track to be a top game for all of 2023.\n\nStudios results were however negatively impacted by disappointing box office performance and this was exacerbated by a very difficult comparison against the success of the Batman last year.\n\nTV licensing revenues declined year over year against certain large deal in Q1 of 2022.\n\nAs David mentioned, we're coming up on the 2023 summers light and early reviews and tracking for the Flash premiering June 16, and Barbie on July 21st look very promising both titles have enjoyed major buzz and we are leaning in.\n\nKeep that in mind for the second quarter when the studio segment will see the expense associated with these marketing campaigns or the revenue opportunity largely impacts Q3 and beyond.\n\nNow let me provide some color on free cash flow, our financial North Star as you know as a reminder, free cash flow of negative $930 million in Q1 of this year is not comparable to the positive 238 million reported last year as the latter represented discovery as a Standalone company.\n\nAnd while our first quarter free cash flow was negative as guided to on our fourth quarter earnings call. We have made significant progress with strong improvement versus the underlying trends in the prior year when Warner media had heavily negative free cash flow.\n\nA few additional key factors to keep in mind first Q1 for both legacy companies has always been the seasonally weakest quarter in part due to the cadence of the production schedule over the year and the timing of certain payments such as for sports rights.\n\nIn Q1, and Q3 carry the additional burden of the semiannual coupon payments in large part for our merger of bonds and impact of over $800 million included in our Q1 free cash flow.\n\nLastly, Q1 also contains significant and expected cash out from restructuring and integration costs close to $500 million during the quarter.\n\nGiven the quarterly puts and takes I'd like to point to the trailing 12 months free cash flow to give you a better sense of the true run rate.\n\nOur trailing 12 month free cash flow is now at $2 $1 billion with a very clear path to our guidance range. The key drivers for the balance of the year. Our number one expected adjusted EBITDA growth backend loaded this year as transformation initiatives continue to unfold and hopefully with a little help from the AD .\n\nBackdrop, even though I should say I have confidence in our guidance range, even if AD sales don't fully recover and age two against the much easier prior year comp.\n\nSecond seasonally positive change in working capital versus the drag in Q1.\n\nThird a significantly narrowing gap between cash content spend in amortization as our D to C business absorbed sequentially higher amortization expenses and redeploy content cash with a more and more rigorous focus on ROI.\n\nFinally, the cash benefit from key transformation initiatives will be backend loaded over the year, while cash out for restructuring and integration will be more frontloaded. In fact, our trailing 12 month free cash flow number at the end of Q1 contains $1 $2 billion of restructuring and merger related cash costs in this line item.\n\nWe expect that these factors will contribute to a higher conversion rate in the second half of the year and slightly again with a disproportionate amount in Q4, not unlike our nearly 100% conversion rate in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we are expecting to see a significant positive swing from negative $900 million in Q1, two around positive $900 million for a roughly cash neutral maybe positive H, one free cash flow overall.\n\nThis will support further debt reduction this quarter on our way to sub four times leverage.\n\nSeparately as you will see in our 10-Q, we temporarily drew down $750 million on our revolver in April to accommodate the intra quarter timing of certain sports rights payments I expect this to be fully paid down by the end of this month.\n\nTo sum up my discussion of free cash flow the level of transparency into and focus on free cash flow and its drivers has changed dramatically over the past 12 months and we are in a strong position to capture this tremendous value opportunity over the course of 2023 and beyond.\n\nIn closing as we lapped the one year Mark since closing the merger candidly it feels like three .\n\nI do come back to the statement I made a few months ago that we've turned the corner at W. BD I continue to view the structural heavy lift is more behind us than in front of us and I see more and more opportunity with everyday I am spending with the iconic brands and a massive global footprint of the combined company.\n\nWith billions in efficiency gains already in implementation, we really are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential of Warner Brothers discovery, we remain as well positioned as any to lean into the many avenues of growth in front of us.\n\nWith that I'd like to turn the call back to the operator, and David JB and I will take your questions.\n\nThank you we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question. Please press star one on your telephone keypad, if you wish to remove yourself from the queue simply press star one again.\n\nYour first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\n\nOh, thanks, so much for taking the question.\n\nDavid and J B I think most interesting how would you define success for the launch of Max or the relaunch of Max as you want to define it I think.\n\nThere's a lot of discussion in terms of choosing as a brand and the need to build out a rebuild that David you mentioned actively trying to include news and sports in the lineup.\n\nSo I'm just curious whether its engagement whether its subscribers whether its ultimate profitability.\n\nHow should investors think about what to expect for Max in the coming quarters and and good or.\n\nI think you've made some strong statements in your prepared remarks, but obviously a lot of investor focus on free cash flow generation and balance sheet here.\n\nYes. The general question is what's your level of confidence in our balance sheet targets over the next couple of years.\n\nWhat gives you that confidence, especially with the euro being backend weighted thanks, so much.\n\nThanks, Doug.\n\nSo we're excited about the 20 .\n\nOkay.\n\nWe've turned the corner on Australian business, we had a different view of it we've we've focused on it very hard and we built what we think will be a very strong independent business and it starts with profitability.\n\nAnd so we made $50 million this quarter, our U S streaming business will be profitable for the year and we have real scale.\n\nAnd so.\n\nWhen you run a business you are looking for growth, which we're going to get in the streaming business and we're driving to get throughout the company and there are a number of areas, where we think that where.\n\nWe know that as the economy improves we will see real growth, but the key here is.\n\nAre you a stream business is no longer a bleeder.\n\nIt's hard to run a business when you have a big bleeder and so getting this business under control focusing on what people love to watch how do we create content that people love and now as we launch Max we'll be able to nourish and delight subscribers with the greatness of Av.\n\nH B O, which on Sunday nights is really a cultural moment, whether it's white Lotus houses dragon the last of us succession.\n\nAnd then put it together with discovery, which is the discovery the discovery content, which has been really strong for us. So.\n\nNumber one we want an easy smooth transition.\n\nWhy we're not doing anything with pricing, we focused very hard on letting everybody know how to make that transition. We have a right now we have a really good hand, and so let's make the transition we got technology, that's far superior in terms of delivering the platform itself and how it can work again.\n\nAll this great content, but let's do a smooth transition and then have people discover the quality content that diversity of content and the quality of the platform itself, which will only accelerate growth Jamie.\n\nI think Doug just to add onto David I think in the very near term migration success as sort of one key metric are you getting the customers who are on HBO. Max today successfully migrated over to Max and then over time there'll be three other metrics and a fourth that will come the three would be brand awareness, obviously where bill.\n\na brand with Max now that is new that is a different proposition a broader proposition for something for everybody in the family some are to customer satisfaction.\n\nNumber three engagement.\n\nYou talked about on the April 12th event, a lot of it is around seeing all of this content coming together and the breadth of the proposition driving higher utilization and therefore, helping retention. Those I think are the core ones and the initial few months and then over time, obviously as that flywheel continues.\n\nContinues we obviously want to see subscriber growth and scale.\n\nThe additional metrics. So those are the ways that we'll look at success.\n\nAlright.\n\nDoug on the on the free cash flow question as you.\n\nYou just heard me say in the prepared remarks, I have I have a high level of confidence in our guidance and our ability to deliver here and taking a step back there is no doubt the environment continues to be challenging.\n\nWe're working against.\n\nSignificant reductions in that sale.\n\nAs I laid out we see a gradual improvement for the second quarter, but it's gradual so so there's that.\n\nWhat you're also seeing in our results is what we've referred to as the built in hedge right. We've got a great game hardwoods legacy box office was a little weaker but across the entire footprint of the company managing as one integrated company, we have enormous opportunity and.\n\nSo we don't want to be in the business of predicting at market developments in the second half as I said I have confidence in our guidance without assuming a complete turnaround here because we're focusing on what we know and what we know is the control that we have over the initiatives that we've put in place over the past 12 months and they are we're knocking them out.\n\nMonth after month quarter after quarter, we've got systems coming online. We've got individual workflows that are going from from 10 to 12 hours of pop to three three minutes I mean, theres a lot thats happening and we have clear milestone scheduled out for the rest of the year.\n\nAnd looking at that.\n\nI have great confidence that we're going to continue to deliver these these improvements and as I pointed out earlier on the cash flow side, it's even more exacerbated.\n\nAnd then on the P&L side with the seasonality of our free cash flow.\n\nThe $930 million in Q1 was pretty pretty exactly in line actually a little bit better than what we had budgeted for and.\n\nWith that I have full confidence we're going to deliver for you guys.\n\nThank you all.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Fishman with Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, Good morning, I have one for David and one for David Gunnar.\n\nDavid can you expand on this strategy you mentioned in your prepared remarks, and maybe the financial benefit of licensing your HBO and Warner Brothers Library content internationally.\n\nUnder the deal as you discussed and how do you balance those licensing deals with your ambitions to scale Max outside the U S. If and when you choose to launch in those markets.\n\nAnd then for J P and good there on DTC.\n\nAnything you can share about the DTC retail versus wholesale trends.\n\nNoticed that wholesale revenue dragged down overall DTC revenues and just whether that wholesale Patrick should continue throughout the year. Thank you.\n\nThanks Robert.\n\nWe are we're focused on taking HBO around the world. The fact that we have.\n\nReal scale.\n\nAround the world that we have content in every language we have channels in every country to promote it is a real advantage for us.\n\nWere really driven by free cash flow and long term free cash flow growth.\n\nAnd so if theres a market like India, where we could we could structure a deal where we can make a lot more money.\n\nBye bye.\n\nBy licensing of our great content in that market.\n\nWith an option at the which we always have at the end of that deal to take another look at that country with our platform. That's already built we're not building a new platform for each country and see if we can go in ourselves can we generate more long term profit and free cash flow and so it's really an economic analysis.\n\nYou will see in most markets it will be us building asset value owning it driving it for long term.\n\nValue and growth you saw us do it at discovery, we will the first outside the U S. We were in 200 countries and it generated a long tail of free cash flow and real.\n\nEBITDA growth for us so I'm very optimistic we're in less than 50% of the countries.\n\nVery hard to have a business that's profitable just in the U S.\n\nI've always thought that you really need to be above the globe and that's the advantage that was the value creation of the Fang companies that they had that scale, we own all of our content and the idea that we're starting off by having.\n\nOur business is profitable this year.\n\nIn the U S. And then we go on this journey of driving it outside the U S with a strong platform that's already built.\n\nThink is.\n\nIt was very well for us.\n\nRobert I would just add to what David said is two two filters as we look at it there is the strategic filter and financial filter that David just talked about which obviously is pretty limited which is a market like India. If we don't believe we can be profitable as a streaming service within a three to five year time horizon at the end of the day right now that's not going to be our priority focus and so if there's opportunities to license that take a bun.\n\nFor money off the table to help support our growth initiatives in other markets, where we think we can scale more profitably and more effectively we do that number one number two there's just a practical reality that some of these licensing deals are done in markets, where we're just not going to be ready to launch from a platform perspective as you talk to as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've got a timetable to Roe.\n\nAll out.\n\nOur new product and convert and migrate our existing HBO Max customers over the next 12 months plus.\n\nAnd some of these things are going to take.\n\nInto 'twenty, five and even beyond to launch in new markets for our platform to be ready and so in the meantime, it just makes perfect sense for us to take as much money off the table as possible.\n\nAnd so.\n\nYes, that's the thinking.\n\nThe added advantages in these markets there is still seeding our brands in those markets. So we're getting value.\n\nThe brand itself is being driven as quality curated.\n\nAnd then we have the handoff when we think that market can be profitable and we have I'm sorry, one other thing I'd say is in all of these deals oftentimes, what we've done which is better than what we have an existing licensing deals is ensuring that when those deals expire we have stronger cliff for the content to come back. So we can actually when we're ready to launch if we assume we're going to launch in those markets at the end.\n\nThose deals we get more of our content back immediately Robert the only thing I would add is on Europe .\n\nRevenue growth in wholesale question too.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind number one Q.\n\nQ1 had a bit of an overlay with content sales revenues and as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, obviously the AD market also on the digital side isn't the greatest right now.\n\nSee a lot of upside opportunity here as that market comes back and specifically for wholesale remember.\n\nRemember that our subscriber base contains the linear HBO subscribers that are obviously showing similar trends to what we're seeing in other parts of the linear ecosystem Needless to say, we expect the total to be a growing business.\n\nWe'll see how the launch goes in May we're looking forward to getting that product out I pointed out some of those them.\n\nOverlapping subscribers, we will see how those wash out, but we're definitely looking for for revenue growth for the .\n\nHalf of the year, and then and then many years to come.\n\nGreat next question.\n\nYeah.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nOkay.\n\nGood morning, maybe first David in JV on DTC profits that are tracking ahead, just curious what's performing ahead of your expectations. There is it the subscribers and revenue is it more about the cost reduction.\n\nAnd I know, you're new into the Max launch domestically, but I'm just curious if youre seeing legacy HBO subscribers, which I think David you were talking about on CNBC. This morning, if youre seeing those folks engaged with the discovery content, it's kind of different genres, but I know thats. The hope so just wondering what kind of early trends you might be seeing there and then.\n\nGunnar on the adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year I think it still implies low $11 billion from your comments it sounds like the macro is still a little tough, but youre bullish with the incremental U S. DTC profit. So I'm, just wondering with DTC performing better and no change to that guidance is there anything thats performing worse or is that better.\n\nKind of in the range as we think about all those different components. Thank you.\n\nHi.\n\nI'll start with the second with the guidance quickly because youre right, obviously, the DTC point.\n\nThe big Big positive driver here, the most important point as I laid out we have very clear visibility into our transformation initiatives.\n\nThe impact that's going to have on the cost base also for the studio definitely.\n\nA support here for the second half of the year very strong.\n\nSummer slate that we're really looking forward to launching and the revenues of those are going to hit from from Q3 onwards, again don't want to speculate about the linear business, but remember that the comp in the second half is going to be much more beneficial because especially the fourth quarter last year was pretty anemic.\n\nIn the scatter market.\n\nBut at the end of the day, we still have a lot of shots on goal here and it's a hit driven business, especially on the studio side. That's why we're giving you a range and I feel comfortable with that range.\n\nWith what I know today.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhen we think about Max as we launch.\n\nWe have real scale.\n\nQuality content.\n\nOur broader aperture.\n\nThe real challenge.\n\nAs the chart.\n\nVery difficult to build a strong business with churn the churn on discovery plus is quite low.\n\nChurn on.\n\nOn HBO Max is high.\n\nAnd so driving that churn.\n\nIs.\n\nAs or maybe more important.\n\nAnd then driving the growth if we can drive down the churn the growth will be very substantial and so we have a series of attacks in order to do that the primary one is how do you nourish more people in the family and the more people use that we've seen that we've been at this in Europe for more than eight years, the more people that use it in the family good morning.\n\nThe more engaged people are the lower the broader of the offering.\n\nThe lower the churn we also have a technology advantage now in terms of catching people that want to buy the product that warranty that we werent able to reach out to.\n\nAnd this is a business of artillery, we're adding a lot of artillery here to the offering in order to get more.\n\nTo get more viewers in the family engaged and excited.\n\nAbout the amazing quality content.\n\nThat we have but we have all weapons.\n\nAnd we have sports and we have news and those are on the sidelines right now we have a great product we're going to.\n\nThat's now going to be profitable for the year, let's drive that.\n\nLet's drive the brand.\n\nAnd know that we have we can move to the left to the right with sports and news, which we've done in markets in Europe , which has been additionally, advantageous JV.\n\nTo Echo what David said, we've seen it across multiple metrics, we've seen it across retention as David rightly pointed out we've had in the first few months of this year record low churn on HBO Max with the churn is still it's still hiring it's still high but we've been with the unacceptable range in order to build the kind of .\n\n.\n\nWe will build and as we've talked about at the April 12th event that was all done through a kind of what I'd call. It slightly more analog attack plan, we're now getting to a tool and a platform as we launch Max that we think has a lot more ammo to be able to actually attack churn and more aggressive fashion. So we think we're just at the beginning of that up.\n\nSwing. The second is we obviously had price rises in the U S as well as a few of the Latin American markets and the reality is the great news. There is we've seen much better reaction and much better retention as well on .\n\nIncreases in those markets and so that's been a positive we've seen efficiencies.\n\nAnd.\n\nAcross the board.\n\nIn some of the items that talked about.\n\nAnd then obviously over time, we've sort of seen some scaling but we've been measured in our scaling.\n\nAnd so that's been a great and as it relates to the content.\n\nCross pollination realities, we've done very little so far, but we have done stuff with Magnolia for example, and as you've heard US I think to hopefully talk about before it was a top 10 performer on the service at once and even a top five.\n\nIn the initial week of launch and so we feel very.\n\nPositive about what that means and as we've cross pollinated content outside of the U S. We've seen similar trends of great reaction and reception from HBO Max consumers to the discovery plus content.\n\nSo when we go full throttle with it when the Max comes together, we feel very optimistic.\n\nSteve If I can just add one thing from the perspective of a longer term outlook here again.\n\nWe gave guidance a year ago.\n\nAround how we see this PVC business developing as I said earlier today many of the operating Kpis are tracking much better than what we assumed again the big thing is getting this product launched and then we will learn so much about.\n\nAssumptions that are now assumptions and hypotheses.\n\nTwo or three months.\n\nThose will be backed up by a lot more actual data. So this is going to be super important period, but needless to say with the U S breakeven.\n\nAnd actually hitting profitability for the full year happening this year a full year ahead.\n\nNow remember as we said before we are obviously, losing money in the business internationally as we are launching market and as we are earlier in the.\n\nThe maturity curve in many of the international markets and Thats going to continue but as I said earlier, we've got that one $1 billion plus guidance for 2025 for the entire combined the business and we'll update that.\n\nOn the basis of what we're learning.\n\nOnce the once the product is in the market.\n\nGreat. Thanks for your question.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Zaffino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you.\n\nThe subject of free cash flow.\n\nAdjusted for one time charges, you mentioned that the last 12 months. The company had produced a little over $3 billion of free cash, adding that one plus of onetime charges to the two plus of underlying.\n\nIf your expectation is that synergies will contribute $2 billion in 'twenty three.\n\nIt seems like you are.\n\nFree cash flow it.\n\nIt has an easy path to $4 billion, which is within your guidance range I'm wondering if you'd add any significant puts or takes to that analysis and specifically is the DTC upside that you described today the idea that.\n\nEBITDA will be 1 billion better than previously expected in 'twenty three incremental to the math I just laid out thank you.\n\nBoth Peter again.\n\nIn the current environment I wouldn't characterize anything as easy but.\n\nI have very very high confidence in the range that we laid out.\n\nWe have confidence in the ability to generate these these synergies youre right on the on the trailing 12 month number but.\n\nIt's a lot of work we have we have line of sight.\n\nAnd.\n\nWe'll take it from there I don't want you to take this isn't an upgrade to our cash flow guidance.\n\nI think we will.\n\nWere among the first to say that the advertising market was basic was starting to be challenging.\n\nAnd so.\n\nWe have been.\n\nPretty careful.\n\nIn.\n\nProjecting because you can't have an advertising market is going to turn and when it's going to turn and so for purposes of how we looked at this year the.\n\nMarket is quite challenging.\n\nIt's improved a little bit, but it still remains a really challenging environment.\n\nBut the good news for us as we built that.\n\nInto our projections for the year and into how we talk to you about what this what we'll face this year and how we'll perform.\n\nGreat next question.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, Good morning, I wanted to ask you about Hogwarts legacy sales have obviously been extremely strong to date can you talk about what you expect for sales of the PS four and Xbox one versions, which I think become available today.\n\nMaybe just relative to sales to date, how much of a lift could you get and also I wanted to ask.\n\nHow the next say X hundreds of millions of dollars of sales would be would look from a margin perspective relative to that first $1 billion because I would assume that there is a lot less marketing and amortization running through in the second quarter and beyond so just wanted to ask about that as we think about profitability for the studio going forward. Thank you.\n\nThanks, Brian .\n\nWe have a very.\n\nVery good.\n\nOur gaming business with 11 different studios.\n\nA real talented capability.\n\nBut the real differentiator for us as a company is.\n\nWe own our IP.\n\nAnd that IP belongs to us and we're developing it in some cases, we may decide to develop it with a third party game.\n\nTechnology company.\n\n.\n\nWe may be the only media company that owns whether it's the DC universe, Harry Potter all of the content that we own game of Thrones, that's for us to deploy and I think that's particularly strategically important because if you look at Hogwarts legacy a big piece of the success of that game as you go into it if Europe .\n\nPlayer you go into that game and you're in that world.\n\nThat's kind of a new concept before it was really.\n\nIt was gaming and it was storytelling.\n\nAnd now it's very difficult to figure out what anyone's definition for the meta versus but when we launch a product as a motion picture of long form story on unmatched .\n\nAnd then we have a game.\n\nGain belongs to us, but now there's this tweener, which is it may be in the next couple of years that we launched our Superman movie and then.\n\nPeople spend more time and Theres more economics.\n\nPeople just hanging out in the Superman World and universe, and the fact that we own all of that.\n\nIs something that I think is going to be really important as we look for is whether as technology develops and given the amount of time people spend on gaming.\n\nWe don't want to be in the motion picture and story and long form storytelling business and have somebody else in the business of hanging out in those worlds because those worlds I think theyre going to be quite profitable in the years ahead.\n\nAnd Brian to the horse legacy.\n\nObviously, the Gen eight releases going out and you are right today.\n\nIs is important.\n\nI would say obviously those consoles are a much smaller base than the current generation consoles that we released back in February . So, it's obviously a much smaller portion of the hole.\n\nBut nonetheless important I think the other big call out is obviously, the Nintendo switch released which will come later this year.\n\nWe see that as probably a much bigger.\n\nInstall base and a fan base that is.\n\nAs it relates to the franchise of Harry Potter, which obviously appeals to a very big audience globally, and a more than in markets like Japan, where Nintendo has a big footprint in Harry Potter skews very strongly in terms of popularity, we see a much bigger upside probably from that release certainly than the gen. Eight.\n\nSo that's kind of how we see the rollout over the next few months.\n\nYes.\n\nThe margin profile.\n\nProfile, Brian is not going to change materially.\n\nWe'll be a little lighter on marketing, obviously retail price points are a little lower so maybe from a gross margin perspective, a little bit of a headwind, but no material change.\n\nThanks, very much I appreciate it.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nTwo questions.\n\nSo David if you step back and.\n\nThink about the last year.\n\nHeavy lifting is done integration restructuring and now the focus is on operating and building your businesses, where do you see that.\n\nMost opportunity and maybe you can touch on timing beyond the existing business you touched on games, but this I'm.\n\nSure.\n\nOur business plan fast you've mentioned in the past you've talking about driving your franchises deeper in animation you. Just mentioned you hired ahead of animation so.\n\nIt's a huge driver for universal So maybe if you could maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nAnd then secondly on sports.\n\nYou've kind of alluded to it coming to Max and if you can say anything more about that and maybe touch on the NBA. What do you think the timing is and ways to slate are there ways to slice and dice the rates among the various players. So that you ensure it's a profitable contract in the next round.\n\nThanks Jessica.\n\nThere is.\n\nWhen we look at this business.\n\nright, we reset the business for the future by looking at each company and saying what should this how should we be structured to have the best chance to sustainable growth in the world today.\n\nWe took out a lot of layers, we built a new leadership team, but we still have a lot of the benefits that will be flowing through this year and next year and we're still finding it we're still opening up some closets and stuff folks out there.\n\nWhich I think is a good thing more opportunity and we've got some businesses that are doing well.\n\nWarner Brothers turns 100, and they've had two of the worst years.\n\nIf you look back at Warner Brothers.\n\nReally just very.\n\nDifficult.\n\nVery difficult on every level in terms of.\n\nWhat was turned out and so we think we've turned the corner on that we've got a very strong leadership team in place now we got James gone and Peter working very hard on DC, which is going to be a very big growth driver for this company.\n\nSo very bullish on DC.\n\nWe the Superman script first draft is done.\n\nIs he is he is on a mission from God.\n\nAnd I think it's a really good moment for us to prove out on D. C. What we got and how strong it is globally for long term sustainable growth.\n\nWe got some more movies coming up that are better we've been working hard on fixing and enhancing them and investing we said no moving before its time.\n\nWith Barbie and flash we have two very good movies doing two very strong.\n\nAnd so I think the slate coming up now that will make a big difference we've lost a lot of money in the motion picture business.\n\n.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd making that turn is important.\n\nto build on.\n\nMax.\n\nAnd we haven't done much with animation at this company, we own Hanna Barbera Looney tunes.\n\n.\n\nIf you take a look at it animation. It's a critical we have we have three animation studios.\n\nAnd we don't have a lot of.\n\nUh huh.\n\nProduction in terms of it's not productive in terms of free cash flow, it's not productive in terms of market share it's not productive.\n\nIn terms of growth and so driving that and we now have a really strong leader our leadership team is in place.\n\nIf this was a if this was formula one and we're dealing with a very difficult environment and it's.\n\nIt's raining in the track is wet and it is a challenge.\n\nWe've got a leadership team of race car drivers here.\n\nIn every case.\n\nAnd so we've got a lot of confidence in Mike and Pam on the Warner Brothers side and.\n\nThe games business is just getting started.\n\nI think it's something that people didn't really pay a lot of a lot of attention to and maybe the most important portion is.\n\nThe fact that.\n\nWe have this great diversity of assets, it's hard to predict what's going to go on but we've restructured this company now we're really tight.\n\nWe're really tight and we're continuing to figure out how do we drive productivity. So we can invest more in storytelling. That's all we do and.\n\nRight now it's sort of.\n\nThe environment is challenged challenge challenge, but as things start to pick up and they will go in different areas and we can't predict exactly when you're going to see a very quick turn at this company. So the idea that we can end this year drive toward.\n\nLess than four times levered with a very tight cost structure.\n\nWith command and control of this business with strong brands that people love around the World and then.\n\nAll of a sudden thing.\n\nThings improve a little bit and you'll see an acceleration.\n\nYes.\n\nLook.\n\nI was just so atom two days ago at the Knick game go next ignited the guidance.\n\nbeen waiting a long time for that one.\n\nAnd but.\n\nWell.\n\nWe're doing a terrific job with the NBA when you look at Berkeley and Ernie.\n\nThat team and shaq.\n\nProgramming, we're putting on we're setting records with the NBA was setting records with.\n\nWith hockey.",
    "content2": "We also have March madness, where we did very well, we couldnt do as well with the with the marketplace because.\n\nSports is relatively strong but sports used to be strong enough that it was also able to help you with the rest of the business and that was happening for a long time and the market was just quite soft and so we're able to take advantage of the sport, but we werent able to take advantage of the piggyback Halo and I think thats true in the industry. It just got.\n\nMore difficult but between.\n\nBaseball playoffs March Madness hockey, we have we have long term deals that are quite favorable to us we like the NBA the deal.\n\nDeals coming up in 'twenty five.\n\nThere's lots of lots of ways it could be re conjugated.\n\nWe did a very favorable deal in the UK with our BT Eurosport business, where we ended up with 90% of the football soccer games, and Amazon got less than 10% of the of the .\n\nChampions League games, we produce that content for four Andy Jaffe.\n\nAnd they promote the us we promote to them and the economics of that deal were.\n\nVery favorable for us and so there is lots of ways to re conjugate it.\n\nWe like the NBA, we hope we can get there, but we're going to be very disciplined we work very hard to build this company to drive profitability to have a strong balance sheet to provide real growth and real free cash flow. That's the long term sustainable nature of this great company and we're not going to jeopardize that for any piece of IP.\n\nI would like to add one.\n\nStrategic.\n\nOperational point, Nonetheless, I think it's super important Jessica and that is our.\n\nFor the sake of the argument we are spending $20 billion of content a lot of that still goes through.\n\nSiloed systems.\n\nStill imperfect processes and in many cases still.\n\nMindset Thats very business unit oriented so I have no doubt we are in the very early innings of looking at this.\n\nAs one Warner brothers discovery content that we talked a lot about the stuff that we discontinued because it didn't make sense financially I think the opposite is true as well I think the company also passed on very very interesting and attractive investment opportunities just because some of the intercompany budget wasn't in place. There. So all of that is going to change will get much better in .\n\ncapital as a company and we will get much better.\n\nThe day to day operational management of spending of that cash.\n\nWe just harmonize those processes.\n\nCentralize those teams that were all fragmented so looking at that the ROI on our capital in the ballpark of 2000 20 billion hopefully growing over the next.\n\nFew years.\n\nIs set to improve and I have full conviction in that.\n\nWhen we talk about our marketing campaigns.\n\nOne of the things to bear in mind is.\n\nWe're using our platforms now that wasn't happening.\n\nWe are really hyper focused.\n\nAs I've said on many nights now we're getting $48 45 close to 50% of all viewership broadcast cable on any given night, we have 25% to 30% of viewership on the platform and using that using bleach or in house of highlights, which is a very young demo using CNN dot com.\n\nSo yes, yes were the campaigns are bigger, but we're one company and so the ability to promote on HBO on our own platforms is it big savings, it's a big savings for us internationally and we're deploying it.\n\nGreat. Let's go to the last question. Please.\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with curious Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question maybe a couple on Max if I could.\n\nCould you update us just how you're thinking about migration.\n\nThis market is in terms of any friction as folks go from one app to the Mac just latest thoughts on on any potential friction there and how youre managing that.\n\nSecondly, you talked about the overlap of discovery plus users, but also have HBO Max what about those that don't and how youre attacking and trying to up sell those to the more the higher price point.\n\nMax service any color there and then just a final one I think this was mentioned on a prior question, but any thoughts around.\n\nA fast here I'm just trying to think about the fact here around Max helped drive top of funnel will help drive advertising helped monetize deep library any any incremental updated color there would be great as well. Thanks so much.\n\nYes, Thanks, Matthew just on the migration 0.1st a couple of a couple of things number. One is remember there has been no change in the billing process. So as it relates to revenue. There is no change and there is no migration as it relates to billing so revenue and billing contains continues to be exactly the same irrespective of whether somebody has actually clinical migraine.\n\nI accepted the new app or downloaded the new app, if they need to and number two is as we said at the April 12th event. There is a large portion of the base that will have to do absolutely nothing.\n\nThe app will automatically convert and upon streaming again, you'll have accepted the terms of use and youll be often running for the portion of the base that actually has to download redownload. We've done everything we can to make it as seamless as possible including.\n\nNot having to input youll basically two clicks to get to the streaming again your video content.\n\nNo need to your user name password will all be migrated your watch list.\n\nAll your history will be migrated and so we tried to make everything is possible now inevitably in these processes youre going to find some friction, but we think it's fairly limited in terms of the subscriber risk associated to the migration.\n\nAnd so we feel very good going into it we've tested it we're all ready for the migration.\n\nAnd.\n\nThe flip side is on then switching to the discovery pluses as Gunnar said, we do see about 4 million subs.\n\nLargely in the U S. But there is some of that internationally as well that overlap between the two services.\n\nAnd obviously, we're going to be doing everything we can.\n\nTo upsell those that are not subscribers, but as we said again.\n\nThe flip side is we're not going to be.\n\nTwo in their face about it at the end of the day, if people want to stay subscribed to discovery, plus and Thats the environment they prefer.\n\nThat business by itself is profitable and we will continue to maintain it and serve them there, but we will over time initially through marketing efforts try and see if we can get them to come in and sample. It will have offers that incentivize them to sample. It for some period of time at favorable economics.\n\nAnd we will see how successful we can be and upgrading them.\n\nThanks Al.\n\nYes.\n\nOh on fast.\n\nSo look on fast we always believed in a hybrid what we call a hybrid strategy, which is ultimately first and foremost kind of what we call channel syndication, which is ultimately we realize that the platforms and the.\n\nDistributors out there.\n\nMany who have the scale and the size that we want to get our channel portfolio out there and viewed as an audience aggregation and advertising business, we've already gotten out with Roku and and we've been very pleased with the initial success with a very small, but a handful of channels that we have out there already we will continue to look to see if we can increase that volume.\n\nTo your point for a second third fourth monetization windows for certain content.\n\nAnd then we're continuing to explore the owned and.\n\nOperated strategy.\n\nAnd at some point in time longer term, we do see this opportunity for this WB TV.\n\nBrand and platform to exist in an owned and operated environment I think at some point that'll be dovetailed with the state of the advertising business and we want to make sure we come to market at the right time when the demand is sufficient.\n\nWe will continue to execute this hybrid strategy of syndicated channels initially and then over time at the right time.\n\nOur own service.\n\nGreat I think that's it thank you very much for joining in.\n\nWe will speak with you soon.\n\nLadies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call you may now disconnect your lines.\n\nOkay."

Discovery, Inc. Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may now begin.\n\nAndrew T. Slabin\n\nEVP of Global Investor Strategy, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Warner Bros. Discovery's Q3 earnings call.

A copy of our Q3 earnings release, trending schedule and accompanying slide deck is available on our website at ir.wbd.com.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Discovery, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying I am pleased with all that we have accomplished in just our first 6 months as a combined company. We have had to work through a number of really tough issues, some anticipated, some unexpected. And we continue to make the difficult decisions that we know are necessary to position our company for long-term growth and success.\nAs you would expect with a deal of this magnitude, in a dynamic and changing industry and amidst a more challenging economic environment, a significant amount of change is required. In fact, we see this as presenting a meaningful opportunity, one that we have seized wholeheartedly. This is an opportunity to look inside each one of our businesses and really determine what's working, what's not working. Is it structured properly? Does it have the right assets, people and resources to be effective and the best of class in the environment we face today? None of this is easy, and nothing happens overnight.\nThat said, we are fully committed and laser-focused. I believe we have the strongest hand in the industry in terms of the completeness and quality of our portfolio of assets and IP across sports, news, nonfiction and entertainment in virtually every region of the globe and in every language.\n6 months in, we now have a full, strong and energized leadership team in place. And we are confident we have the right strategy and are making the structural and strategic changes to successfully achieve our goal of becoming the greatest media and entertainment company in the world, capable of generating significantly higher earnings and free cash flow than we are today and creating real long-term sustainable shareholder value.\nLast quarter, we laid out 3 strategic priorities that serve as our guiding principles and influence our decision-making strategically, operationally and financially.\nStarting with content. Content is the heart of everything we do, and we are investing at historic levels in the highest quality storytelling, sports and news. All of the hard work we are doing now will allow us to continue making meaningful investments in content to support our plans going forward. Our best-in-class portfolio is led by the strongest content and creative executives in the business. And one of the things that differentiates these leaders is that they do more than just pick shows and write checks. They support and nurture our creatives and talent and help them to bring their bold visions to life on screens large and small. They are doers who have spent time in the control room developing films and TV shows, writing scripts, working closely with talent and creatives. They know their crafts inside and out, what it takes to create compelling, unforgettable experiences for fans worldwide. And they know how to replicate that success and storytelling over and over.\nNo one embodies this creative commitment more than our new heads of DC Studios, James Gunn and Peter Safran, who have said that running DC Studios is a passion project, not just a job. James is a brilliant storyteller who has the distinction of being the first and only filmmaker to direct a movie for both Marvel and DC. Peter is a prolific producer whose credits include DC's highest grossing movie, Aquaman, as well as the entire Conjuring universe, the most successful horror franchise of all time. We could not be more thrilled to have them join our leadership team, and I'm excited for what is to come.\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few months with James and Peter, talking about our strategy and long-term plans for the future of DC across TV, animation and film. They have a powerful vision in blueprint that will drive a more unified creative approach. It will enable us to realize the full value of one of the world's most iconic franchises. They're hard at work right now.\nOur teams company-wide are working hard every day to ensure that Warner Bros. Discovery is the place creatives choose to come and tell their stories. We have a huge advantage: Warner Bros. with its 100-year legacy and ability to launch films in every corner of the globe, tied together with Warner Bros. TV, the biggest maker of television in the world, and HBO, 2 of the most prolific storytelling studios in the world. Together, it creates an unparalleled full-service entertainment ecosystem.\nTo that end, we recently signed a long-term deal with Matt Reeves, who cowrote and directed The Batman and created the upcoming new series, The Penguin, for HBO Max. Todd Phillips will begin filming the highly anticipated Joker sequel next month. We signed an overall deal with Quinta Brunson, a trailblazer who brought us the hugely popular Emmy-winning TV series Abbott Elementary. And our longtime partner, the prolific Chuck Lorre, is producing his first series for HBO Max, the upcoming comedy How to Be a Bookie with Sebastian Maniscalco, just to name a few.\nWe're very excited about our robust film slate for next year. We are back in business with a lineup of features that is truly supportive of a distinct theatrical window. The slate includes The Flash; Shazam; Dune 2; Aquaman; Wonka, a prequel to the classic film; The Color Purple produced by Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones; and Blue Beetle, DC's first superhero, will be starting a Latino character directed by Angel Manuel Soto; as well as exciting new series for HBO and HBO Max, including The Idol from the brilliant Sam Levinson, who created Euphoria, and starring The Weeknd; The Last of Us, based on the postapocalyptic video game; along with new scripted original series for TV such as Lazarus Project set to air on TNT next year.\nWe also have projects underway with incredible on-screen talent, including Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga for Joker 2. Ryan Gosling has joined Margot Robbie for Ocean's Eleven prequel. Robert Pattinson will return as Batman. Robin Thede's Emmy-winning HBO comedy series, A Black Lady Sketch Show, has begun production on its fourth season. The award-winning cast of Succession will return next spring for its fourth season also. And the list goes on and on.\nOur unparalleled IP also allows us to grow our consumer products business and extend our characters into games, one of the fastest-growing media segments with titles such as the much-anticipated Hogwarts Legacy game built around the amazing world of Harry Potter and launching in the first quarter next year, and leveraging incredible IP such as Mortal Kombat, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year and still going strong.\nOn the sports side, we just re-signed Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith for multiyear deals. We've also got a long-term deal in place with Shaq. We're thrilled to have the 4 of them continue to host TNT's flagship studio show, Inside the NBA, I believe the best show in all of sports. And this further reflects our deep commitment to sports and providing fans with the programming they can't live without.\nCNN's new show, CNN This Morning with hosts Don Lemon, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, kicked off this week with great buzz. No one knows morning television like Chris Licht, and the show is one of the many building blocks he and his team are putting in place as Chris leads CNN into the future with great courage and strategic vision.\nOur second strategic priority is maximizing the overall value of our content through an omnichannel distribution and monetization strategy. The fact is we cover more surface area than any other media company, and that optionality allows us to distribute our content in multiple ways. No matter where consumers go or what their preferences are, premium, pay-TV, free-to-air, theatrical, streaming, gaming, we are there around the globe and able to monetize our content and IP in ways that maximize audience and profitability. Optionality has never been more important, and we continue to refine what the right windowing and distribution model is so that we can reach even more consumers and maximize profitability.\nAs we said last quarter, we will be aggressively attacking the AVOD market with our own FAST offering in 2023. As the company with the largest film and TV library in the industry, we have a unique opportunity to increase our addressable market and drive real value, and we plan to move quickly. Stay tuned.\nFinally, our third strategic priority is operating as one company. One plus one does equal more than 2 when it comes to working collaboratively and supporting individual efforts across our many businesses. In many respects, this is a significant departure from the previous norm. We've already had some real success with our cross-promotional initiatives such as with Shark Week, Elvis, House of the Dragon and Black Adam. The fact is with our huge viewership share in the U.S., our broad portfolio of networks and global platforms around the world, we have an amazing ability to efficiently cross-promote across our lineup.\nOur one team philosophy is a core tenet to the critical work we continue to do to transform the organization for the future. And nowhere is this more evident than with our ongoing commitment to driving synergy enterprise-wide. Success requires all hands on deck, and we're seeing it. In fact, I'm pleased to share that we have increased our synergy target to at least $3.5 billion from $3 billion.\nGunnar will take you through the details, but the key point is this is more than just a dollar tally of what we've saved on an expense line. It is more than just a number. We are fundamentally rethinking and reimagining how this organization is structured, and we are empowering our business unit leadership to transform their organizations with an owner's mindset and a view on quality and accountability. And you see this reflected in our numbers and some of the strategic decisions we are making.\nWe're making real progress, and we're driving toward the endgame. Like everyone in our industry, we are managing through some cyclical headwinds and secular challenges, including lower-than-expected ad sales and faster pay-TV subscriber declines. Gunnar will say more, but I do want to make a couple of quick points.\nFirst, regarding our advertising sales, which have been impacted by a number of factors that include the macroeconomic downturn and the strength of the NFL and college football on other networks. The good news is on Turner, we just had Major League Baseball's American League Division and Championship Series on TBS. Both saw substantial double-digit growth in viewership compared to last year, though a shortened Championship Series wasn't ideal.\nThe NBA is off to a great start on TNT, delivering its most watched regular season coverage since 2017 with viewership up 29% season to date. And with March Madness in the spring, along with our first ever coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals, from now through the summer, we have a large share of professional sports, both here in the U.S. and internationally.\nOn the advertising side, we had a great upfront where we outperformed the market, and we spent the last 4 months reorganizing the ad sales team. We had a broad restructuring, including having sports and news be organized and sold with entertainment and nonfiction as one full-service offering. It was an awful lot of work, and we're glad to have it behind us. The team is led by the superb Jon Steinlauf, who has a great track record of outperforming the market and did so for us in the 5 years following the Scripps acquisition as he led our team at Discovery.\nSo the team is now in place, attacking the market with the full suite of tools every way a brand wants to engage with consumers, whether through traditional commercials, product placement or dynamic targeting. We will offer those touch points.\nWith respect to direct-to-consumer, we added nearly 3 million net global direct-to-consumer subs this quarter, and we expect a healthy inflection with the launch of our combined service and expanded global footprint. With that, we are excited to announce that we have moved up our U.S. launch date from summer of 2023 to spring. We've been very hard at work. We can't wait to make the service available to consumers around the globe and get the business running on all cylinders.\nWhile our team is hard at work preparing for the launch of our combined offering, we're also actively experimenting and testing our hypotheses about the future product, in large part to address some of the deficiencies of the existing platform. And we're seeing some positive signals.\nA few quick examples. One is related to the product user experience. Previously, when a series concluded on HBO Max, there was no end card that would then recommend additional programs for the user to enjoy, an obvious way to drive greater consumer engagement. We've started rolling this out and are already seeing very promising engagement uplift.\nA second example, around content. We've begun experimenting with bringing d+ content on to HBO Max, starting with select Magnolia Network shows such as Fixer Upper: The Castle, which was a top 5 show after only its first few days on the service. These early green shoots bolster our strategic thesis that the 2 content offerings work well together, and when combined, should drive greater engagement, lower churn and higher customer lifetime value.\nAnd lastly, on churn. We've implemented a number of initiatives to improve customer retention, and these have helped drive our voluntary churn rates to record lows in the last few weeks. We've still got a long way to go, but these early signs are certainly encouraging.\nAs we said, we plan to roll out the new service here in the U.S., followed by Latin America in 2023, then in Europe and APAC thereafter. We see significant opportunity across the globe, and we're excited to resume expanding our distribution in countries where we are currently not represented. As you would expect, we made the strategic decision to hold off on active expansion until our new offering is set to launch.\nBefore I turn it over to Gunnar, I was recently asked if I thought the golden age of content was over. And I said absolutely not. There's nothing more important than content. People are consuming more content than they ever have, but it has to be great content. It's no longer about how much. It's about how good. And ultimately, it is the consumer who tells us what is good. And the consumer is telling us right now, with House of the Dragon, Euphoria, Batman, Harry Potter, Friends, Big Bang Theory, you take a look at the portfolio of tentpole assets across Warner Bros. Discovery, and the breadth is large, and the opportunity is real. No one has a better or more recognizable hand of content, IP, brands, franchises and personalities than we do.\nThat said, I believe the grand experiment, chasing subs at any cost, is over. Let's face it. The strategy to collapse all windows, starve linear and theatrical and spend money with abandon while making a fraction in return, all in the service of growing sub numbers, has ultimately proven, in our view, to be deeply flawed. We believe there is a real opportunity to do things differently, to deliver the content consumers want and will pay for while getting the full value of our offering. As we said last quarter, our focus is on delivering $1 billion of EBITDA in streaming by 2025, and we expect to make significant progress toward this goal next year. Profitability, not purely sub count, is our benchmark for success.\nWhile we've got lots more work to do and some difficult decisions still ahead, we have total conviction in the opportunity before us. At Warner Bros. Discovery, we've got the best assets in the industry, reach that extends from premium, basic pay-TV and free-to-air to theatrical, streaming, consumer products and gaming, exceptionally talented people across this great company and the right strategy and financial framework to set us up for long-term success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gunnar, and he'll walk you through the financials for the quarter.\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Discovery Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to start out by building upon what David said earlier. We are very pleased with our overall synergy program and the broad canvas on which we are transforming this company.\nTo that extent, I'm now confident to commit to a $3.5 billion synergy number as we have had an opportunity to further assess our operations in more detail and refine our work stream plans. That means we are now adding $500 million of incremental potential beyond the target of $3 billion, and we are still working on detailing out the financial impact of the list of further initiatives beyond what has already been quantified. As always, I will keep you updated as these plans reach the level of detail and certainty we require for them to be included in our total synergy estimate.\nRegarding the actual execution of our transformation program, we expect to have realized approximately $750 million in synergies by the end of this year and an incremental year-over-year $2 billion in 2023. From a high level, and as David said, the opportunity at hand goes well beyond just the synergy capture dollar value. This is a fundamental transformation across and throughout the organization, a refocusing on how WBD is organized, how it's managed, how the teams are incentivized and evaluated, all of which results in an ability to pivot and evolve in this dynamic media ecosystem.\nAnd we are starting to see the financial impact materialize. The 11% SG&A reduction ex FX in Q3 is an important early proof point, and we are on track for around 20% SG&A reduction in Q4.\nWe've seen great traction on a number of fronts early on. First, in global marketing efforts such as with television and theatrical releases, House of the Dragon, Elvis and Black Adam most recently leveraging the broad footprint of our owned and operated media assets like never before, helping to drive global awareness in a very cost-efficient and effective way.\nSecond, in content workflows, where across WBD, there are numerous teams facilitating the important processes of content customization, languaging, administration of rights, participations and residuals, et cetera. Following substantive analysis, we have made the decision to centralize many of these critical functions and to harmonize the processes across the organization. In some cases, we'll collapse 10 to 12 versions of essentially the same process across the company into one best practice, unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars in efficiency gains.\nThird, on the streaming side, the previous strategy was to build largely duplicative organizations between HBO Max and the traditional international business. We have now embraced the powerful combination of global capabilities from our streaming team in areas like product, engineering, data and analytics and marketing, married with local expertise from our international team in areas like distribution, content creation and ad sales. This has already led to a clearer strategic direction, streamlined processes and decision-making while at the same time reducing significant duplicative cost.\nFourth, procurement is another great example of how professional management will impact our financial performance. For the first time, there is a full mandate across all of WBD to leverage the outstanding capabilities, experience and expertise of our global procurement team, and we are on track to deliver hundreds of millions of P&L impact. And finally, we've begun the process of streamlining virtually every corporate and supporting function with a lot more to work through into next year and beyond.\nOur focus is on the hard work and the tough decisions in the spirit of repositioning this company operationally and strategically so that in a more constructive market environment, we're better positioned to capture upside revenue opportunities, which, after having restructured our cost base, should result in an amplified impact to our bottom line and in an ultimate earnings power of the company significantly above current levels with real upside for long-term shareholder value.\nTurning quickly to the results for the quarter. Given we're still in the first year following the closing of our acquisition, I will discuss all P&L elements on a pro forma combined ex FX basis.\nStarting with the studios segment. Studios revenues decreased by 5% due to lower home entertainment revenues and last year benefited from COVID-driven demand, and fewer new releases year-to-date resulted in less theatrical revenues and less titles hitting the home entertainment and pay-one window during the quarter. This was partially offset by a 34% increase in other revenue, thanks to the reopening of our studio tours. The revenue decline was more than offset by lower content expense for theatrical and TV as well as lower marketing expenses from fewer theatrical releases, leading to studios adjusted EBITDA growth of 43%.\nNetworks revenues decreased 8%. Specifically, advertising revenues decreased 11% globally, primarily given the softening demand amid well-noted global macro headwinds. We have been quite transparent about the risk in the environment since the summer. Obviously, this is something impacting all players across not only the advertising industry, but the broader economy, which has more or less continued thus far into the fourth quarter. Worth noting are a few items impacting comparability with Q3 last year, namely the Olympics and the NBA playoff schedule creating a few hundred basis points of additional headwind in the third quarter.\nGiven the strong value proposition of our platforms and reach, tailwinds in digital advertising solutions from products such as dynamic ad insertion and continued pricing opportunities, we feel very well positioned and stand ready for when the market environment improves.\nDistribution revenues declined 2%, primarily due to pay-TV subscriber declines in the U.S. and lower affiliate rates in certain European markets, partially offset by higher affiliate rates in the U.S. and premium sports packages in Lat Am. Content revenues declined 37% against the prior year comp from sublicensing the Olympics broadcast rights in 2021.\nNetworks adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% as lower content expense primarily due to the Olympics last year as well as lower personnel and marketing costs partially offset the revenue decline.\nDTC revenues decreased 6%, predominantly due to the expiration of the Amazon wholesale deal, which we have now fully lapped, partially offset by retail gains. Advertising revenues more than doubled during the quarter driven by subscriber growth on our DTC ad-supported tiers.\nCost of revenues increased 22% due to growing programming costs, while SG&A decreased 18% as we continued to take a more measured approach to marketing as well as better coordinating the utilization of the invaluable promotional firepower of our O&O platforms. Adjusted EBITDA losses were $634 million during the quarter, and we continue to expect that 2022 will be the peak year for adjusted EBITDA losses in the segment with healthy improvement next year on the back of cost synergy initiatives and positive inflection in revenue trends following the launch of the newly combined product.\nTurning to consolidated results and free cash flow. Both revenues and adjusted EBITDA decreased 8% during the quarter. And while still down, our year-over-year EBITDA trend saw significant sequential improvement over Q2, and I expect further sequential improvements in Q4 and into 2023.\nReported free cash flow was negative $192 million, and let me provide some more detail here. Cash flow from operations decreased nearly $700 million, primarily due to seasonality from the semiannual cash interest payment on a large portion of the acquisition debt as well as merger and integration-related costs, which totaled nearly $400 million during the quarter, including payout of retention bonuses to legacy WarnerMedia employees put in place prior to the closing of the transaction. This brings the year-to-date total to approximately $650 million.\nFurthermore, we reduced the balance outstanding on the securitization facility by $500 million from $5.7 billion to $5.2 billion, which also negatively impacted Q3 free cash flow, managing the program in line with the seasonal cadence of collections and revenue.\nAs previously mentioned, we repaid $2.5 billion of debt during Q3, bringing the total debt repaid since the closing of the transaction to $6 billion. We ended the quarter with $50.4 billion of gross debt and $2.5 billion of cash on hand.\nTurning to guidance. Now with 2 months left in the year, we see adjusted EBITDA for 2022 landing towards the middle of our guidance range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion or about $9.2 billion. This is notwithstanding the incremental drag from currency and continued and greater than originally anticipated headwinds in the advertising market across much of the globe. It also includes the additional amortization of HBO content we have implemented following the detailed assessment of our content assets.\nWe continue to see reported free cash flow for the year at $3 billion and now see net leverage at the end of the year at approximately 5x. Building off of this projected baseline and looking to 2023, we continue to target, and our teams are working towards, $12 billion in adjusted EBITDA. And in a more normal advertising environment, we believe that target should be achievable. That said, the lack of visibility on advertising globally creates a more challenging path towards achieving our target, given advertising is, by far, the greatest variable impacting our financial performance for 2023.\nI'd also like to offer a couple of other puts and takes to bridge from this year to 2023. First, synergy will be a healthy tailwind, and we expect $2 billion of incremental EBITDA impact year-over-year, as I detailed earlier. Second, the first half of 2023 should see an additional tailwind of a couple of hundred million dollars from the impact of our course correction measures implemented over the last several months, for example, CNN+. And third, FX trends and overall pay-TV trends are naturally outside of our control and difficult to predict.\nWe continue to expect our free cash flow conversion rate to be in the 33% to 50% range. In addition to the factors described above, free cash flow will depend on the timing and size of the cash restructuring costs to be realized from 2023 as well as on content and working capital dynamics.\nTo close, I'd like to reiterate that the future and mid- to long-term earnings power of this new combined company is as vibrant as ever, and we're decisively taking the necessary steps to enhance our operating structure and emerge as a leaner and stronger global media company, which will position us to take advantage of the eventual market recovery. We continue to focus on and invest in high-quality content and platforms with a flexible approach to monetization to drive growing and sustainable free cash flows, which we believe will ultimately maximize long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator. And David, JB and I will take your questions.",

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Warner Bros. Discovery Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions) Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may now begin.\n\nAndrew T. Slabin\n\nEVP of Global Investor Strategy, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 earnings call.

We released a trending schedule with pro forma results and additional financial information, which also can be found on our website. And lastly, our discussion today will include an accompanying slide presentation, which following the call, will be available on our website.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Discovery, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nWe've had a very busy and productive 4 months since launching Warner Bros. Discovery. And today, we want to provide you with an update on where we are and where we're headed. Among our top priorities have been combining the rich legacies of these 2 great organizations, building out our senior management team and beginning to integrate the cultures into one global operating company.\nWe've made significant progress on all fronts. Nearly our entire senior leadership team is in place, and I could not be more excited to continue locking arms with the exceptionally talented group of individuals that we've assembled from both legacy companies. Plus more recent additions like esteemed filmmakers, Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, now at the helm of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, and a uniquely talented media operator, Luis Silberwasser, driving our leading global sports strategy. And just last week, we announced our new Chief of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Asef Sadek. Asef previously served as Head of Diversity Equity and Inclusion International for WarnerMedia and is one of the most dynamic leaders in the diversity space.\nSince the close of the deal, the entire leadership team has been moving as quickly as possible to integrate key elements of our business, assess growth opportunities and make important progress in our synergy capture and strategic planning. We've been able to dig deeper into the financials and have gained a much better, more complete picture of where we are and the path forward including identifying some additional and unexpected challenges that have and will continue to require our focus and attention.\nThe upside is that there is even more room for improvement in cost savings. At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the many cross currents and headwinds at play in the macroeconomic environment, both here in the U.S. and globally, including inflation, the threat of recession and the complexities of today's geopolitical environment.\nIn light of all these factors, we've had to make some additional adjustments, which we'll talk about. Gunnar will walk you through our financials and the path forward in a few moments.\nSuffice to say, we are more confident than ever in the strength of our position and believe we are on the right path to meet our strategic goals and really excel, both creatively and financially. Our long-term investment thesis is truly compelling, and we have great conviction in the opportunity ahead. Warner Bros. Discovery has the most powerful creative engine and bouquet of owned content in the world, as highlighted by our recent 193 Emmy nominations, more than any other media company.\nThe fact is there are only a handful of companies globally that can do what we do. And putting it all together, we believe no one does it better than us, spanning HBO, Warner Bros. Film and Television studios, CNN, our world-class sports business and category-defining lifestyle and nonfiction content engines.\nOur asset mix, one of the most complete and diversified in the industry, uniquely positions us to drive a balanced approach to creating long-term value for shareholders. It represents the full entertainment ecosystem and an ability to serve consumers across the entire spectrum of offerings from premium pay to linear and free-to-air, theatrical to streaming. This was the driving force to create this company over a year ago. Our objective was not only to be one of the top global streaming companies, but also a media company able to drive financial returns by distributing our content on every platform, and our conviction has not changed.\nWhile we're still in the very early stages, and helped by the first wave of our synergy initiatives, we will have repaid $6 billion in debt by the end of August, and we have implemented initiatives leading to $1 billion in run rate synergy over the next 12 months with at least an additional $2 billion in the works as part of our cost synergy plan.\nWe did very well at the upfront and believe we have meaningfully outperformed our peers. As I said in our presentation, we see ourselves as essentially the fifth broadcast network due to our unparalleled portfolio and our low to mid-teen CPM increases or nearly $6 billion in commitments clearly demonstrates that advertisers now view us exactly that way.\nWe offer our partners the most complete portfolio of live sports and news, lifestyle and entertainment and our average share of viewership outside of the football season exceeds 25%. On some nights, we're bigger than NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox combined. While there's a lot of uncertainty in the economic backdrop, this is a strong proof point for the value we bring to the table, and our ability to improve monetization over time.\nIn many ways, we're just getting started and have really only begun to scratch the surface with respect to the potential upside. And believe we'll make even more headway in the next 2 to 3 years.\nAt every stage of this endeavor, as we pursue opportunities and tackle challenges, build and grow our business, we will be guided by 3 strategic priorities that will inform all of our planning and decision making. First, we will seek to attract the best storytellers and use our unparalleled creative engine, franchises and brands to produce the most compelling and diverse content offering in the world.\nWe are home to many of the most iconic brands and franchises in the history of entertainment: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, Game of Thrones, CNN, HBO, HGTV, Discovery, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Television and many, many more. The opportunity this presents is truly unmatched.\nWe're also the preeminent maker and seller of content in the world. And going forward, we will continue to invest smartly in content in ways that will help us to grow, achieve greater market share and have a bigger impact. Some of the content we create will be distributed on our platforms like the highly anticipated House of the Dragon premiering on HBO Max later this month. And some will lay on other platforms such as Ted Lasso and Abbot Elementary. Our focus is on making great content, content that people want to watch and will pay for.\nAs I've said, it's not about how much, it's about how good. Owning the content that really resonates with people is much more important than just having lots of content. In other words, at a time when almost every piece of content ever made is available to consumers across any number of free and pay services, duration, quality and brands have never been more important. And that is what we do best. When the measure is who's got the best stuff, no one has a better hand than we do.\nSecond, we will maximize the reach, engagement and overall value of our content through a broad distribution and monetization strategy. Our job is to tell great stories and to bring them to as wide ranging in audience as possible in as many ways as possible and to deliver the greatest viewing experience possible. Certainly, technology plays a big role in this, and we still have a lot to learn, but it's equally important that we be flexible and agile, able to respond to ever-changing consumer preferences.\nAs the maker and owner of the largest and most complete library of content in the world, we cover more surface area than almost any other media company, theatrical, streaming, linear, cable, free-to-air, gaming, consumer products and experiences, our own platforms, other's platforms. And we have no intention of being beholden to any one in particular or to a specific business model. Simply put, we are open for business.\nThere's been a lot of experimentation in our industry, and we are all smarter for it. At Warner Bros. Discovery, we believe strongly in the importance of preserving optionality and driving returns through a strategic mix of distribution and windowing options. For example, we will fully embrace theatrical as we believe it creates interest and demand, provides a great marketing tailwind and generates word-of-mouth buzz as films transition to streaming and beyond.\nWhen you're in theaters, the value of the content and the overall viewing experience is elevated. Then when the same content moves to PVOD and then streaming, it is elevated again. As films move from one window to the next, their overall value is elevated, elevated, elevated. We saw this clearly demonstrated with the Batman and Elvis.\nWe have a different view on the wisdom of releasing direct-to-streaming films, and we have taken some aggressive steps to course correct the previous strategy. With respect to streaming, our main priority right now is launching an integrated SVOD service. And in a few moments, JB will talk more about the strategy and some of the key building blocks and milestones as we bring HBO Max and discovery+ together under one offering.\nOur streaming strategy has evolved over the past year and really reflects the importance of, rather than the dependence on, this segment of our global content monetization plans. I am pleased with the work to date and the progress we continue to make on this front.\nAnd in the spirit of optimization, once our SVOD service is firmly established in the market, we see real potential and are exploring the opportunity for a fast or free ad-supported streaming offering that would give consumers who do not want to pay a subscription fee access to great library content. While at the same time, serving as an entry point to our premium service. We will talk to you more about our potential plans at our Investor Day, which is planned for the end of the year.\nI'm also pleased to announce today that we have extended our relationship with AT&T, making them a trusted partner in the distribution of HBO Max as part of their service offerings. This is great news for our business as it ensures that even more people will have access to our world-class and award-winning content.\nThis leads to our third strategic priority, and that is to operate as one company with one mission, to be the premier media and entertainment leader globally. We believe the best way to maximize the value of our company is by operating our businesses as a combined enterprise rather than as a series of separate siloed and unconnected business units. HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Television, CNN, our U.S. Networks, Sports, we are stronger together, and we'll make meaningful progress in operating our businesses as one team.\nWe also have a great ability to promote, advertise and introduce new products and services enterprise-wide, and we intend to take full advantage of these capabilities. You saw this with the successful rollout of Elvis across all of our platforms. And you're seeing it now ahead of the launch of House of the Dragon. We're employing every capability at our disposal. It is the biggest campaign in HBO's history, and it's already paying dividends. Rewatching of the original Game of Thrones is up dramatically on HBO Max.\nWe're also going to be opportunistic about the way we grow our business in the future, whether by improving existing products or services to enhance and personalize the consumer experience, introducing new ones or expanding into new markets globally, with particular focus on how to scale smartly with an eye on sustainable free cash flow even during periods of incremental reinvestment. We see ample opportunity to drive significant efficiencies from further integration and transformation, which Gunnar will take you through.\nIt's a foundational tenet of how we will operate and manage, the byproduct of which will be significant free cash flow generation and growth. So our 3 strategic priorities are to create the most compelling and diverse content offering in the world; maximize its reach, engagement and value through a broad distribution and monetization strategy; and operate as one company with one mission, to be the premier media and entertainment leader globally.\nIn an industry as dynamic as ours, we are best positioned for success. We have everything we need to thrive creatively and financially, including the greatest and most popular franchises and IP, the most diverse collection of global media brands and assets, the ability to generate awareness and excitement for our products across our own various platforms, a strong leadership team and the most talented creatives. While we're still in the early innings, I couldn't be more excited about where we're headed as a company. As I said, we're open for business. And if you're in this business, this is the place to be.\nWe look forward to sharing lots more with you at our Investor Day at the end of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to JB, and he'll walk you through the details of our SVOD strategy.\n\nJean-Briac Perrette\n\nPresident & CEO of Discovery International, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and hello, everyone. Over the last almost 120 days, I've had a chance to spend time with this incredibly talented team, take a closer look at both products and their technology, better understand our proficiencies as well as areas where there's need for further development and dig in on what consumers are saying about the 2 services. We have a lot of work to do, but these first few months have only strengthened our belief in the significant opportunity ahead of us. And I'm excited to share with you some initial thoughts on our strategy and road map.\nFirst, a bit of context. For decades, our industry has embraced changing technology and consumer demand by evolving a very successful windowing approach to exploiting content. However, in recent years, a strategy has emerged that suggests the video business will be better off collapsing all windows into streaming, overpaying for and overinvesting in content and offering it all at the same time for a low price.\nWe don't believe in this strategy. While we intend for streaming to be a critical part of our company and a key driver of our growth as consumers continue to shift their viewing habits from linear to nonlinear, it's only one part of our diversified approach. The focus of our streaming strategy is consumer choice. We believe there are multiple global consumer segments in streaming, just like there have been for decades in traditional television. Some who are willing to pay a premium for an ad-free experience, others who are more price-conscious and prefer to pay less with limited advertising, and a sizable third group who will not pay a subscription fee and only want to enjoy ad-supported entertainment.\nWarner Bros. Discovery's unmatched depth and breadth of content provides us the opportunity to offer something for everyone. Providing consumers with a range of entertainment options will maximize our reach and financial returns. Currently, we're focused on launching our combined SVOD product with both an ad-light and an ad-free version in many markets. But as you heard, we've also begun to explore options of how best to reach consumers in the free ad-supported streaming space. We currently license our library to others, but we'll assess how best to play in this growing business as the model evolves from free-to-air linear to free-to-view streaming.\nNow focusing on our ad-free and ad-light SVOD offering. The great news is the combination of HBO Max and discovery+ could not come at a better time as both are enjoying strong momentum. HBO Max has emerged as the most acclaimed streaming service among consumers and discovery+ remains one of the top-rated apps and the dominant leader in real-life entertainment.\nThere are also 2 very unique and complementary streaming services, distinct in their content appeal ranging from premium scripted series like Succession and the much anticipated House of the Dragon to leading unscripted programming such as 90 Day Fiance and Fixer Upper. The 2 services are also different in terms of how subscribers engage with the content. Some of it being more appointment viewing driving subscriber acquisition, other content being more comfort viewing, driving subscriber retention with people watching hours on end.\nThese are 2 critical and powerful components of a strong and sustainable subscription business. Couple this with our world-class collection of globally recognized brands, franchises series and characters, it is truly an unprecedented combination.\nIn an already crowded market, consumers know these brands, and they trust them to deliver quality. The quality of our content engine speaks for itself as evidenced by the 193 Emmy nominations this year, more than any other media company. From drama to comedy, documentaries, the factual, lifestyle, the reality, local series from around the world, the sports in Europe and Latin America, and of course, movies.\nAhead of the launch of our new combined service, we're introducing a number of exciting interim initiatives. First, content sharing. As we announced earlier today, discovery+ will add a CNN Originals Hub on August 19, making it the home of the award-winning CNN series and films, including the Anthony Bourdain collection and featuring series such as This Is Life with Lisa Ling and Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy. And starting later this fall, HBO Max will begin hosting some of the Magnolia content from the incomparable Joanna and Chip Gaines, including their latest series Fixer Upper: The Castle arriving in October.\nSecond, as David mentioned, we are leveraging the marketing power of our combined portfolio with the biggest TV audience many nights in the U.S., the second largest broadcast group in Europe, the #1 pay-TV portfolio in Lat Am and leading pay-TV lineup in APAC. We will drive significant awareness for our content and streaming products, much at no cost given the creative use of unsold or noncommercial inventory.\nShark Week is just one recent example of the marketing benefits and financial synergies we see from strategic cross-promotion across our company.\nNow more about the product and technology. We will roll out our new combined offering under a single brand, and we'll have more to share closer to launch. On the product side, we recognize that both of our existing products have shortcomings. HBO Max has a competitive feature set, but has had performance and customer issues. discovery+ has best-in-class performance and consumer ratings, but more limited features. Our combined service will focus on delivering the best of both, market-leading features with world-class performance.\nTo deliver this, our team has developed a clear road map to migrate onto one tech stack, leveraging much of the core infrastructure of the highly rated discovery+ service with significant and important feature enhancements from the more established HBO Max.\nOur product design and feature set will enable better content discovery and more personalized choices. All of this, coupled with the unparalleled breadth of quality content, will help drive our leading objective, which is growing engagement.\nThis will, in turn, enable us to meaningfully reduce churn, support gross adds and increased monetization, particularly with our ad-light offering. There's much work to be done over the coming months from retooling the tech platform to enabling proper content and metadata ingest around the world and ensuring a seamless customer migration for launch. There's lots to do, and we're determined to get it right, which will take a bit of time.\nOur primary focus for the rollout will be in the markets where HBO Max has already launched. Given its broader international footprint, we plan to launch the service sequentially starting in the U.S. next summer. Latin America will follow later in the year, European markets with HBO Max will follow in early '24, with additional launches in key Asia Pacific territories and some new European markets coming later in 2024. Of course, as we get more of the development work and testing under our belt, we will explore ways to accelerate the rollout, if and where it makes sense.\nIn addition, there will still be significant opportunity for expansion beyond this as these 70-plus countries represent less than 60% of broadband homes globally, excluding Russia and China. And many of the biggest markets, such as the U.K., Germany and Italy do not fall within this 2025 plan. But we want to remain disciplined and prove out the strength of our product and profitability first.\nAll of this culminates in developing a strong, financially attractive business over the next 3 years. Our focus is on shaping a real business with significant global ambition but not one that solely chase the subscribers at any cost or blindly seeks to win the content spending was. Instead, one that scales smartly.\nSo now what does this all mean for the streaming business? Our financial North Star will be EBITDA driven by solid top line growth and greater cost efficiency from the combination of these 2 products. We expect peak EBITDA losses for the D2C segment will occur this year in 2022 as we do the heavy lifting around technology, personnel and integration ahead of the planned relaunch starting next summer.\nWe're targeting the U.S. streaming business to be profitable in 2024 and for the global streaming segment to generate $1 billion in EBITDA by 2025. Embedded within this target result for 2025 is an EBITDA drag from less mature markets and new market launches. We believe that we can achieve these milestones with a total subscriber base of around 130 million global subs.\nToday, our total subscriber number for HBO Max and discovery+ is 92 million, an increase of 1.7 million over first quarter. This number now excludes other streaming products in the portfolio and synchronizes our subscriber definitions, which Gunnar will get into more later. The goal of this is to provide you with a clear and transparent number of true paying subscribers to our core service. You should also note that we estimate an additional overlap of around 4 million subscribers between the 2 services today. So we anticipate adding more than 40 million incremental sales by 2025.\nTurning to ARPU. As we just reported, our current ARPU is almost $8 globally, comprised of nearly $11 domestically and almost $4 internationally. We expect healthy ARPU growth off this base due to a few factors. First, a new pricing strategy. Consistent with our profitability focus, we will shift away from heavily discounted promotions that were part of the gross ads focused strategy of the past to a more balanced approach that optimizes revenue as well as subscribers.\nSecond, and related to this, price increases, particularly in certain international regions where we are well below market. We will also plan for periodic increases as accepted in the marketplace. Third, scale benefits from broader distribution of our ad-light offering. And as our reach and engagement grow, we will also drive CPMs, leveraging technology enhanced products and targeted advertising. We've clearly started seeing the benefits of this at discovery+.\nOn the cost side, we see meaningful synergies from 2 particular non-content areas. Marketing, which is over 60% of SG&A, we'll see benefits by moving to a single branded product leveraging the power of our owned networks as well as more optimized spend. In technology, which is the third largest portion of our OpEx, where we will eliminate duplicative spend, reduce third-party vendors and see significant opportunities for automation.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to have healthy content investment, but with these 2 content portfolios coming together, we see smart opportunities to do this at a much more measured pace than in the previous plans. All in, we see long-term margin potential at scale of at least 20% and expect to make significant progress towards that goal over the next few years. Lastly, based on the operating leverage in the business, we believe we can achieve incremental margins of around 50% of every dollar of additional revenue growth.\nTo summarize, at Warner Bros. Discovery, we believe that in an already crowded market and at a time when the global economy is prompting many consumers to prioritize their purchase decisions, we are uniquely and best positioned to be at the top of global consumers lists for video entertainment. Our greatest strength and what positions us for success as a company long term is our ability to monetize our unparalleled collection of content in multiple ways in order to provide consumers choice and optimize asset value.\nThat is what we intend to do and streaming the 1 key part of our overall strategy. We look forward to sharing more with you as we get closer to launch. And now I'll turn it over to Gunnar for a closer look at our Q2 financials.\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Discovery Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, JB, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from JB, we are taking thoughtful approach in how we intend to scale our D2C business smartly and methodically. And it's just one component of a more balanced distribution strategy versus one that seeks to drive subscriber growth at any cost. This will be an important theme throughout the discussion of our second quarter financials and our outlook for the balance of the year as well as 2023.\nTurning to our financials. As you can see, it's been an extremely busy first full quarter as a combined company, strategically, operationally and financially. Picking up from when we spoke to you last, while we've already implemented a significant number of initiatives following the closing of the WarnerMedia transaction, we've only become more confident about the long-term potential for Warner Bros. Discovery. The strategic logic behind bringing these 2 great companies together is as apparent and sound as when we announced the deal.\nAs noted prior, the recently concluded upfront is a timely example of just that. Despite the more challenging macro environment, we're very pleased with our performance, which proved the enormous value of our content portfolio to our advertising clients and as a differentiated means to service brands. Out of the gate as a combined company, we have been focused on debt paydown, and I am pleased to report that by the end of this month, we will have paid down $6 billion of debt since closing the transaction.\nWe're equally as focused on integration and efficiency, and I'm very pleased with the progress of the synergy program. We now have 1,000 individual initiatives staffed. Measures already implemented worth $1 billion of run rate savings. The clear grip on milestones and business cases for at least another $2 billion in flight and eyes on further upside and opportunities. We will continue to update the market on progress as well as implications for related cost to achieve as we move our synergy program through the implementation stages.\nNow I'd like to very briefly address our Q2 results, which we are providing in a new segment structure. The composition of our new segments is very similar to the way Time Warner are presented previously. In addition to the second quarter financials, we also provided trending schedules, including 2021 segmented pro forma financials with the earnings release this afternoon to give you a financial baseline for Warner Bros. Discovery. The trending schedules are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nI will speak to the second quarter financials on a reported basis. And we'll address growth rates on a pro forma combined FX basis, as always, to provide more transparency on underlying performance.\nLet's turn to the individual segments, starting with Studios. Studios results were driven by strong games performance, specifically behind LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga as well as consumer products, while home entertainment and theatrical face difficult comparisons against last year's strong COVID-lifted catalog sales and larger film slate.\nWith the Networks, revenue was up 1% and EBITDA was down 11%. Advertising increased 2% globally, largely driven by sports on the Turner Nets in the U.S. while international advertising was down modestly, in large part due to the sale of Chilevisión last September as well as a decline in EMEA.\nGlobal Distribution revenue was down slightly with the U.S. flattish and international down 3%, which was impacted by pricing declines in Western Europe. EBITDA decreased in part due to increased sports rights cost versus last year.\nWithin D2C, revenues increased by 4%, while adjusted EBITDA declined $325 million year-over-year. Performance was mainly driven by: number one, substantial content investments across the global footprint as part of the push to launch HBO Max in as many markets as possible prior to closing the deal; as well as number two, revenue pressures in the wake of sunsetting the Amazon distribution deal last September; and number three, tough prior year comps with 2021 enjoying the benefit of the day and date windowing strategy for Warner Bros. feature films.\nConsistent with our prior comments, we continue to thoughtfully spend ahead of the launch of our integrated product. In part, having put some planned new country launches on the back burner, but we are gearing up and are very excited for the global release of House of the Dragon in August, the highly anticipated prequel to Game of Thrones.\nImportantly, we are changing the way we present our D2C subscriber numbers going forward to align our subscriber definitions across the legacy Discovery and WarnerMedia businesses. Starting with the paying subscriber count reported on our Q1 earnings call of roughly 100 million subscribers, we have made the following key adjustments that totaled 10 million subscribers. First, the HBO Max subscriber number historically included certain unactivated subscribers under the AT&T Mobility distribution agreement. Consistent with legacy Discovery policy, we will exclude such unactivated subscribers going forward.\nSecond, as JB detailed, we have refined our strategy with a clear focus on one combined D2C product. As such, going forward, we will exclude non-core D2C subscribers outside of the discovery+ or HBO Max products from our account, such as subscribers of MotorTrend, Eurosport Player and a few smaller other products.\nAgainst this harmonized definition, we ended Q2 with 92.1 million subscribers, representing 1.7 million sequential net adds during the quarter. Please refer to the aforementioned trending schedules for historical subscriber data as per the harmonized definition.\nPlease note that while we have adjusted our ARPU calculations for the corresponding revenues, total Warner Bros. Discovery D2C segment revenue will still include fees received from N4. Those subscribers no longer included in our core subscriber count.\nNow turning to the consolidated group. On a consolidated basis, revenue was down 1%, driven by increased intercompany eliminations, impacted by larger internal sales and licensing, while adjusted EBITDA was down 31% or $812 million year-over-year.\nThese results are driven by the legacy WarnerMedia businesses with significant cost increases across all segments. Please note, year-on-year, FX was a $228 million headwind to revenues and a $30 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Despite the many crosscurrents running through our P&L at the moment, we ended the second quarter with $789 million of reported free cash flow. This included approximately $250 million of cash restructuring and onetime charges related to the merger and integration.\nWith respect to overall Q2 financial performance, clearly, these results are neither indicative of the health of the underlying assets nor of their longer-term trajectory, but rather the fact that we're starting from a less favorable position compared to our expectations. In addition to the clearly more challenging macroeconomic backdrop and a changing industry dynamic in the streaming space, we have also now had an opportunity to fully assess legacy WarnerMedia's financials post closing.\nHaving concluded this process, we determined that certain legacy WarnerMedia budget projections that were made available to us prior to closing, varied from what we now view as legacy WarnerMedia's budget baseline post closing. On taking a deep dive in pressure testing, what we found, our assessment has resulted in lower EBITDA projections.\nSpecifically, we identified a number of approved investments and foregone revenue in various parts of the business that, when taken together, impacted full year 2022 EBITDA by roughly $2 billion. Some examples of these business decisions include: number one, significant reductions in external content sales. As part of a corporate initiative to prioritize HBO Max growth globally, new content licensing deals to third parties were largely halted and content was, in general, made exclusive to HBO Max. This is, of course, an upside opportunity over time as we ramp initiatives back to a balanced level of monetization depending on relative value contributions.\nNumber two, similarly, certain actions taken to limit HBO Max B2B distribution provided a headwind to performance, and we believe there may be opportunities to course correct. Number three, substantial investments in kids and animation content for both linear and D2C platforms without an adequate investment case against them. Number four, substantial investments in direct to HBO Max films, for which, again, we did not find sufficient support. This means adjusting the way we invest going forward and also evaluating those projects already completed or in progress. Wonder Twins, Bad Girls and Scoob!: Holiday Haunt are examples of streaming films that do not fit this new strategic approach.\nThese are difficult decisions, but we are committed to being disciplined about a framework that guides our content investment for maximum return. Number five, significant incremental and loss-making content investments for the Turner networks. Specifically content spend on shows that did not have a path to generate sufficient ratings or incremental monetization potential. And number six, incremental corporate expenses transferred from AT&T resulting from the spin-off of WarnerMedia as per the final carve-out financials.\nWhile these factors will, of course, impact our 2022 financial performance and 2023 to a lesser extent, we have implemented immediate measures to address and redirect the trend line. Most importantly, supported by key leadership changes and the introduction of a more robust framework for capital allocation based on financial metrics and measured KPIs. Key measures include: number one, the shutdown of CNN+. Number two, restructuring the scripted content portfolio on the linear net, kids and animation, direct to HBO Max films as well as international local content not sufficiently supported by robust enough investment cases.\nNumber three, a more balanced approach to external licensing as we embrace a more holistic content monetization model for Warner Bros. Discovery globally, generating significant revenue upside while protecting key strategic franchises such as Friends, Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, et cetera. Number four, implementing an HBO Max distribution strategy aimed at wide availability as opposed to D2C only distribution. As well as number five, greater accountability, alignment and communication across businesses.\nTurning now to synergies. Our work on integration and transformation since closing gives us increased confidence in the synergy opportunity. Every day, over the past 15 weeks, I have experienced the muscle memory that many on our integration teams have built over the past years of change and integration. We have already implemented initiatives totaling more than $1 billion of run rate impact. This will grow from this point, the opportunity to implement transformational change across the global organization is enormous, and we're being thoughtful about its prioritization and cadence.\nIndividual initiatives range from direct merger-related opportunities such as consolidating our real estate footprint against hybrid and agile work environments to opportunities tied to David's operating philosophy as one integrated company.\nThe latter opens up tremendous transformation potential along systems integration, process harmonization and importantly, optimize utilization of our O&O promotion and advertising potential.\nI am very pleased with how well the program has progressed so far and based on the savings potential in our initiative funnel, I have full confidence that we will expect at least $3 billion of synergies overall, with $2 billion to $3 billion of synergy realization in 2023. Naturally, we'll update the market regularly as certainty on value and timing increases.\nWith that, I want to share our current thinking on the 2022 and 2023 financial outlook. As you may recall, we first developed our guidance for the combined Warner Bros. Discovery 15 months ago. Today, after 100 days of thorough analysis and financial planning post close, we are adjusting our 2022 and 2023 EBITDA outlook, primarily based on: first, a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop resulting in a more conservative outlook overall and for ad sales specifically. Second, a change in the streaming industry dynamics and our strategic response. And third, as noted earlier, the difference is in legacy WarnerMedia budget projections that were made available to us prior to closing versus what we now view as legacy WarnerMedia's budget baseline post closing.\nTaking all these factors into account, 2022 will clearly be a transition year, and we see an adjusted EBITDA in the range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion.\nFor further context, I'd like to provide some color on third quarter trends. Global advertising revenues in the third quarter will be impacted by some tough prior year comps, specifically the Summer Olympic Games, 2 NBA Eastern Conference finals games played in early July last year, as well as the sale of Chilevisión. And given the less favorable macro environment, we are seeing softer demand and the scatter market at the moment. As such, we expect Q3 global ad sales to decline by high single to low double digits based on current booking trends.\nOn the positive side, we are beginning to see the impact of our course correcting measures and we expect some synergy capture beginning in the back half of this year. Furthermore, we expect to generate free cash flow of around $3 billion after cash cost to achieve in 2022. On that basis, I am expecting net leverage at year-end to be approximately 4.8x.\nTurning to our outlook for 2023. Based on the full year impact of our 2022 corrective actions and $2 billion to $3 billion of synergy realization in 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be at least $12 billion. We expect to convert approximately 1/3 to half of our adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow in 2023 as we make progress towards our long-term target of approximately 60%. The cadence of content investments, restructuring spend, CapEx and working capital improvements will impact the timing of free cash flow generation.\nWith that, I want to give a quick snapshot on our balance sheet. We are reiterating our long-term gross leverage target of 2.5 to 3x, which we expect to hit by the end of 2024, and our gross leverage will be within our current ratings category by mid-2024 or earlier. As stated before, we will continue to dedicate virtually all free cash flow generated to debt reduction until then.\nWe had $53 billion of total debt at the end of Q2, including $6.5 billion of term loans. Importantly, our debt financing is generally long term with an average maturity of more than 14 years and a 4.3% average interest rate and equally importantly, interest rates for the vast majority of our debt are fixed. We have no remaining payments due in 2022, and we currently have $1.3 billion due in 2023 and $4.3 billion due in 2024.\nAlso note, earlier this week, we finalized the post-closing working capital adjustment process with AT&T as part of the merger agreement. And as a result of that, AT&T will pay us $1.2 billion in August. With that, and combined with prepayments made in July, by the end of August, we will have paid down $6 billion since closing the transaction in April.\nWe've covered a lot of ground today, but we've really only scratched the surface with respect to the significant amount of strategic work being done across the organization. And we'll take you through a much deeper dive with a comprehensive look across continent networks as well as D2C at our Analyst Day towards the end of the year.\nIn closing, if there is one key message to take away is that we have never been more excited about the underlying strength of the creative bedrock of this combined company and the broad monetization opportunities for decades to come. David's leadership team has come together quickly, and we're fully focused on driving hard to deliver the value upside of this combination, and I remain excited to share our progress with you along the way.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator, and David, JB and I will be happy to take your questions.",

Discovery, Inc. First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Additionally, please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may begin.\n\nAndrew T. Slabin\n\nEVP of Global Investor Strategy, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Warner Bros. Discovery's Q1 Earnings Call. With me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will include forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements include comments regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance.

You should have received a copy of our Q1 results. If not, please feel free to visit our website at ir.wbd.com.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid M. Zaslav\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Discovery, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. Two weeks ago, we closed our transformational merger and began our next chapter as Warner Bros. Discovery. As we begin the exciting work of bringing together the rich legacies of these 2 great companies, our mission is simple: to be the world's best storytellers with world-class products for consumers.\nIt's been fantastic to finally have the teams working together. And I'd love having the opportunity to get time with the new leaders across WarnerMedia as well as thousands of employees across key locations in the U.S. And I couldn't be more impressed by the strong sense of motivation and excitement, an opportunity to unleash the potential of the combined talent pool of this new great company.\nThese last few months in our industry have been an important reminder that while technology will continue to empower consumers of video entertainment, the recipe for long-term success is still made up of a few key ingredients: number one, world-class IP content that is loved all over the globe; two, distribution of that content on every platform and device where consumers want to engage, whether it's theatrical or linear or streaming; three, a balanced monetization model that optimizes the value of what we create and drives diversified revenue streams; and four, finally, durable and sustainable free cash flow generation.\nWarner Bros. Discovery emerges as a far more balanced and competitive company and uniquely positioned to deliver on these 4 critical ingredients. We have no religion about any one platform or window versus another, and we intend to approach each and every decision through a lens of enhancing asset value against a set of financial returns. Our goal is to maximize long-term shareholder value and asset value, not just subs. We will not overspend to drive subscriber growth.\nOur focus is to invest in content and platforms that extend the life and return of our global IP and position us to drive greater returns out of each dollar of content spent than our peers and to ultimately drive free cash flow. And we will refine our capital allocation and content windowing decisions accordingly.\nWe can maximize the distribution of our global IP in a number of ways, guided by simplicity and choice for consumers. In streaming, we have a massive opportunity to reach the widest possible addressable market by offering a range of tiers, all with the most compelling and complete portfolio of content, a premium and attractively priced ad-free direct-to-consumer product, a lower-priced ad-light tier, something we have had tremendous success with and is our highest ARPU product, and in some very price-sensitive markets outside the United States, we can even offer an advertiser-only product. We have the ability to ring any number of cash registers: theatrical, gaming, premium home video, pay TV and free-to-air broadcast. Plus streaming now with 100 million collective subscribers, it is a growing and important complement to these existing and traditional avenues of monetization and represents true optionality that, over time, will drive our strategic decision-making.\nGiven the depth of our content, decades of film and scripted and unscripted television series, many of the most iconic brands and franchises, including half of the MGM library, supported by a continuous pipeline of new production, together with the world's news leader, CNN, and a large international offering of live sports, we have enormous flexibility in terms of how we monetize these assets. We benefit from a deep history of world-class content production. Warner Bros. Films, Warner Bros. Television and HBO, true global leaders that are producing at scale, true content makers like Warner Bros. Discovery, with an ability to produce and control the content IP versus those that just write checks, are positioned best to win.\nAs you've heard me say, we are not trying to win the direct-to-consumer spending war. To begin with, we firmly believe the 2 content companies coming together have unique advantages, including the largest film and television library from Warner, the largest domestic and international lifestyle library from Discovery and significant global live sports and news. This strong foundational offering will allow us to invest in scale smartly and will uniquely position us in our drive to become a fully scaled global streaming leader. We come into this transformational moment with great creative momentum.\nJust to give you a glimpse, starting with the global success of the Batman at Warner Bros. Studios; at Warner Bros. Television, Ted Lasso; and breakout hit series Abbott Elementary on ABC, which was just renewed for a second season; and of course, Chuck Lorre's unique and compelling content.\nThe HBO Max, which is on such a roll, fresh off record viewing for HBO series Euphoria, Winning Time, Gilded Age and Barry, the hit Max Originals And Just Like That, Peacemaker and the Flight Attendant. And in Europe, the Beijing Olympic Games at Discovery, Chip and Jo and the launch of Magnolia and 90 Day is a real strong performer on Sunday nights, just to name a few.\nOne of the company's unique assets is the linear network group. And in 2021, taken together, we enjoyed the #1 share in total television total day in all key demos and people 2+. And we have the greatest brands: HG, Food, HBO, Discovery, CNN, NBA, March Madness, NHL, Magnolia, the Oprah Winfrey Network.\nOur balanced verticals and content genres across scripted, lifestyle, sports and news provide us with significant opportunities to not only cross-promote for the benefit of the portfolio but also to offer compelling reach and targeting campaigns for our advertising partners. I'll speak to this a little more in a moment, but this isn't just a domestic phenomenon. In LatAm, for example, we are now the #1 or 2 pay TV programmer in every market, and we bolstered our position as the second largest broadcaster in Europe.\nAgain, we are excited about the strength of our sports portfolio and the optionality that gives the new company. We enjoyed our exciting March Madness and Final 4, NBA regular season and what looks to be a strong playoffs at Turner and capping off our first season of the NHL and playoffs. Major League Baseball has just started to come together while having just completed a robust Olympic Games in Europe, as I noted.\nLastly, CNN is once again setting the standard for groundbreaking and journalism first news coverage. During critical moments, the world turns to CNN. At its core, CNN is the nation's premier news outlet and has the #1 digital news service in the United States with 35 million unique monthly users. The heroic reporting out of the Ukraine reminds us all that CNN is the world's most impactful news platform, and for us, a true reputational asset.\nFrom a management perspective, we have brought together a strong leadership team and a streamlined structure to foster better command and control and strategic clarity and coordination across the entire company. We've just begun to hit the ground running with the teams and the broader organization. My focus is to foster a culture of collaboration and to embrace a singular focus around being the top home for the best and most diverse talent and creators to bring their stories to Warner Bros. Discovery. We will have our heads down across the company, and we'll have a more formalized and detailed outlook across our businesses to share in the coming months.\nThough in the course of initial planning, integration and synergy capture, early action priority items for me will be the upfront. Like with Scripps, we are fortunate to have closed the transaction in time for this year's upfront marketplace. We expect our presentation on May 18 to be an important opportunity for the company to share the full suite of our combined network portfolio, the top talent and personalities within the family and the breadth of genres across series, specials, news, sports, streaming and the best lifestyle content in the world. The combined strengths of both organizations' client relationships, advanced advertising, programmatic, sponsorships and direct-to-consumer, ad-light streaming services, all position the company with a unique hand.\nI have personally spent quite a bit of time with key advertisers and agencies. And I'm so impressed with the combined capability of our platforms and our ability to uniquely serve the needs of our clients, including integrating sports alongside our broad entertainment offerings.\nOne offering where before it was Discovery, Warner and Sports, now as one, it's simpler and provides more value to advertisers. In many respects, we are building upon the momentum that Jon Steinlauf has built with Premier, bringing unduplicated broadcast equivalent reach and greater share to advertisers, helping us to secure a greater share of revenue. I remain very enthusiastic about the upside here and this multiyear opportunity.\nDirect-to-consumer. JB and his team are deeply involved in the early integration phase and go-to-market plans, having had very little interaction across the organizations during the pre-closing period. This will take some time, though key steps to identify and analyze technology proficiencies, subscriber concentration and overlap, content opportunities, marketing and pricing strategies are all underway.\nContent. Kathleen Finch on the network side, along with Casey, Channing and Toby, are assessing the opportunity across the entire organization, and they are significant as drivers of both more efficient spend as well as revenue upside. Like direct-to-consumer, we will have more to say in time, particularly on windowing as well as content sharing.\nAnd finally, synergies. We have been working hard for months and are now validating and executing against those 200-plus work streams. The attack is strategic, operational, structural and financial. We will clearly take swift and decisive action on certain items, as you saw last week with CNN+, while others will take time to formulate appropriate action plans. We've detailed a $3 billion-plus cost synergy plan, and we're already on our way with coordinated efforts from our transformation office as to the waves over which this will unfold.\nJust 18 days in, we are as enthusiastic and excited as ever with the opportunity ahead to integrate and drive the new Warner Bros. Discovery. The leadership team is locking arms on our integration plans and long-term growth strategy, and we look forward to providing more detail on each of these in the coming months.\nI'll hand it over to Gunnar, after which he and I will answer some questions.\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Discovery Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. What an exciting moment. It's great to finally be able to tackle the challenges and embrace the opportunities ahead as we begin the hard work to integrate WarnerMedia and Discovery. Please remember that today's call is predominantly meant to discuss Discovery's Q1 operating performance. So as you know, our merger with WarnerMedia closed just after the end of Q1 on April 8. To the extent possible at this time, I will share some reflections on our early observations as well as WarnerMedia Q1 results that AT&T disclosed last week.\nStarting with a quick review of Q1 results for Discovery stand-alone. Discovery's first quarter U.S. advertising revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Our next-gen advertising products like discovery+ and GO performed well, and we continue to see positive impact from last year's upfront, which helped to outpace delivery declines on the linear side.\nWhile scatter market continues to be solid with pricing up over 30% versus upfront, visibility, not surprisingly, continues to remain limited given the current macro environment. For us, categories like auto, technology and CPG are weaker versus last year, while travel, entertainment and retail remain healthy.\nU.S. distribution revenues were up 11% year-over-year largely driven by the growth of discovery+ subscribers throughout 2021, while linear affiliate revenues were also up year-over-year as rate increases continued to outpace subscriber declines. Our fully distributed subscribers were down 4% as were total portfolio subscribers when correcting for the impact of the sale of our Great American Country network in early June last year.\nTurning to international, which I will discuss on a constant currency basis. Advertising grew 11% in the first quarter, in part helped by the Beijing Winter Olympic Games as well as underlying momentum in certain key markets such as the U.K., Germany and Latin America. That said, we did begin to see some limited impact from the conflict in Ukraine towards the end of the first quarter in markets such as Poland and Germany as well as some macro headwinds similar to the U.S. While visibility remains limited in certain key European markets, at this moment, we expect Discovery stand-alone international advertising revenues to grow in a similar fashion with Q1, excluding the Olympics impact, which was a nice positive. At the moment, we're pacing up low single digits.\nDistribution revenues increased 8% during the quarter largely driven by continued growth of discovery+. Do note that we did not launch any new markets during the quarter as we previously outlined and in line with our strategic thinking coming into the closing of the merger.\nOn the linear side, we continue to see healthy growth in LatAm, while pricing pressures in certain European markets remain a headwind. This also, in part, reflects hybrid affiliate deal structures, which balance affiliate fees and B2C distribution.\nFurthermore, note that revenues from our Russia JV, which we announced we had exited, are recognized as distribution revenue. This resulted in a 100 basis point drag to distribution revenues during the quarter. I would also note that Discovery's exposure to Russia and Ukraine in total is less than 1% of revenues and 1% to 2% of AOIBDA.\nOperating expenses were up 11% during the quarter, primarily due to the Olympics. Excluding the impact of the Olympics, OpEx declined by 2% year-over-year as lower marketing costs as compared to the elevated discovery+ launch than last year were partially offset by higher content costs across our portfolio.\nNet-net, we finished the quarter with $1.03 billion of AOIBDA, up 23% year-over-year, including a small negative impact from the Winter Olympics and roughly $170 million of investment losses. Net income for the quarter was $456 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.69 per share.\nNow turning to some housekeeping items to consider for the quarter as you update your models. First, we recognized a $0.58 per share gain from the $15 billion notional interest rate hedges that we implemented last year. We unwound this hedge in mid-March in conjunction with the successful closing of our $30 billion debt offering.\nSecond, the impact of PPA amortization during the first quarter was $0.49 per share. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we decided to take a more conservative position and accelerate the amortization of purchased customer relationship intangibles. As a result of this, our Q1 D&A expense increased by $164 million year-over-year. Adjusted for the 2 items I noted, EPS would have been $0.60 per diluted share.\nTurning briefly to the WarnerMedia results that AT&T reported last week, which I'd note is based on how AT&T has historically reported the segment and which will not necessarily tie to carve-out financials or how we plan to segment the business going forward. We are working on Q1 carve-out financials for WarnerMedia as well as updated pro forma financials for Warner Bros. Discovery, and we will have those disclosed before the end of the quarter.\nSpeaking to the reported numbers for now. Underlying performance at HBO Max during Q1 was healthy with growth of 3 million net adds, reflecting continued strength of the programming slate. In total, together with Discovery's 2 million net adds, the pro forma company added 5 million paid subscriptions during the quarter. Adding the 2 subscriber bases, we ended the quarter with just over 100 million global D2C subscribers. So please note that we are still working through alignment of our subscriber definitions and the focus of our subscriber reporting going forward, after which we will have a more refined and detailed update when we report second quarter results.\nHowever, the operating results, as you have seen, were down in WarnerMedia's first quarter, a 33% decline versus prior year to $1.3 billion. Free cash flow was down even more, declining by $2.6 billion versus prior year and more importantly, significantly negative in absolute terms. Again, this is for WarnerMedia in the AT&T segment structure and includes elements that are not part of Warner Bros. Discovery going forward. In my mind, there is both good and bad news in these results.\nStarting with the bad news. Q1 operating profit and cash flow for WarnerMedia were clearly below my expectations. And given that Q1 performance and previously unplanned projects in flight, I currently estimate the WarnerMedia part of our profit baseline for 2022 will be around $500 million lower than what I had anticipated, however, with a positive offset of a couple of hundred million dollars on the Discovery side of the combined company.\nOpening leverage as a consequence of this, while still dependent on working capital adjustments that have yet to be finalized, is likely to be a notch higher, now estimated around 4.6x give or take and still well below the initially modeled 5x.\nNet-net, being the first year of our integration, and as we've explained all along, 2022 will undoubtedly be a messy year. So a lot of moving pieces and now a somewhat less favorable starting position in Q1.\nThe good news on the other hand is that I also see more opportunity as I work through the numbers. There are certain investment initiatives underway in plain sight that I don't think have attractive enough return profiles. As such, and with our new combined leadership team in place out of the gate, I feel very confident in our ability to rectify some of the drivers behind the business case deviations and some very quickly, with the CNN+'s decision last week being Exhibit A.\nAnd while we're still early in our integration process and are still at the beginning stages of initiating our synergy as well as strategic and financial planning, we feel more confident than ever about achieving our $3 billion cost synergy target and believe there is a much greater opportunity off of the current baseline and that target will ultimately prove conservative.\nAnd to be clear, we remain fully committed and reiterate our financial targets for 2023, and I remain very confident that we are on track to achieve our target gross leverage of 2.5 to 3x at the latest 24 months after closing. We are refining a more detailed bottoms-up combined budget and long-range plan, the key insight of which we look forward to sharing in the months ahead. Prior to that, I wanted to share some high-level priorities that we are digging into early on as well as some initial financial and operational observations since close.\nNumber one, content. I'm working very closely with our creative and financial leadership teams to examine the totality of our $23 billion plus of annual content spend to analyze the ROI of each dollar spent. The goal of this exercise is not to identify ways to reduce what we spend on content but to harmonize processes and analytics so as to be more consistent and efficient in how we allocate our content spend across the entire global portfolio to optimize returns.\nSecond, marketing. The combined company spends more than $5 billion each year on marketing, and that doesn't include the opportunity cost of cross-promoting assets across all of our platform. We intend to drive for the highest level of financial discipline here to make sure that every dollar spent is purposeful and measured. This will prove to be an enormous opportunity for cost synergy capture across the globe within each and every business line given the significant overlap geographically and operationally.\nLastly, working capital. Since I joined Discovery 5 years ago, a key focus area has been to improve working capital efficiency. This has been a critical part of the formula that has led to our free cash flow conversion rate being among the top end of our peers. Similarly, I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to continue improving working capital efficiency at Warner Bros. Discovery operationally and structurally, and this will be a key ingredient in achieving our free cash flow conversion rate targets.\nAs I stated at the beginning of my remarks, I am invigorated by the opportunity ahead to build a unique and truly remarkable media company centered around unparalleled IP and a balanced monetization model to drive sustainable profit and free cash flow growth. We're only 18 days in and are still in the very early stages of integration and refining our long-term strategy, and we look forward to sharing more about our plans in the coming months.\nThe new combined management team is completely aligned around our philosophy to manage Warner Bros. Discovery with the highest level of professionalism, with diligent analysis and decision-making, accountability and overarching coordination of our balanced portfolio of assets in the best interest of the company, focused on free cash flow and firm value more than anything else.\nNow with that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator, and David and I will be happy to get your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and a very good morning to everyone. This morning, we reported another very good quarter, with net income of $3.8 billion and earnings per share of $1.86, with an ROTCE of 8%. Now excluding the goodwill impairment from the Banamex transaction, our adjusted EPS was $2.24, with an adjusted ROTC of 9.7%. Revenues were up 9% and every business had record third quarter revenue and improved returns. We continue to generate positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our 5 businesses.\nThe consistently strong results that we've been delivering are a consequence of how we have fundamentally changed the bank in recent years. We're running the businesses differently and capturing the synergies between them. We've added new senior leaders to complement the excellent talent we already had. We are disciplined stewards of our shareholders' capital, investing it where we should and returning what we don't deploy. And the best part is, there is much more upside ahead.\nTurning to the businesses. Services had a record quarter with revenues growing by 7%. [indiscernible] growth in cross-border transactions and U.S. dollar clearing reflects the sharp focus we've put on increasing fee revenue. AUCA grew 13%, reaching nearly $30 trillion. New client wins and share gains demonstrate the confidence that our clients have in our ability to help them navigate a very dynamic global environment and to lead through innovation.\nDespite low volatility, markets had a record third quarter. Revenues were up 15% as we continue to drive momentum and traction with clients. Activity in rates was particularly high and equities grew nicely, with continued progress in prime, where balances were up over 40%, complementing our historical strength in derivatives. In Banking, increased clarity around tariffs and record equity prices field CEO confidence. We capitalized on this with investment banking fees up 17%, with continued growth across all products. On the back of our investment in talent, we improved our position in tech, health care, consumer and responses. We continue to add talent to the team, which will help us deepen or establish relationships that will bear fruit over the next 2 to 3 years. Well, had another good quarter, with revenue up 8%, driven by Citigold and the Private Bank. Our emphasis on growing investment assets resulted in record net new investment assets of $18.6 billion and client investment assets increasing by 14%.\nWe announced a new partnership with BlackRock where they will manage $80 billion of our client asset fully aligning to an open architecture strategy. USPB had record quarterly revenue of $5.3 billion reaching 12 straight quarters of positive operating leverage and delivered an ROTCE of over 14%. We drove momentum in branded cards with the well-received launch of our City Strata Elite card. And this quarter, we will introduce a new mid-tier product to round out the City Advantage portfolio. It will innovate the travel experience for American Airlines' customers and create access to premium benefits.\nIn the retail bank, we continue to innovate including by the launch of Instant Payments through FedNow and enabling digital issuance for Citibank debit cards. And retail bank continues to strengthen as a pipeline to our wealth business with $4 billion in deposits transferred in the quarter. Wealth is capitalizing on those transfers, and we continue to see improved investment penetration and significantly higher investment-related revenue from those customers.\nWe returned over $6 billion in capital to our common shareholders during the third quarter, the $5 billion in share repurchases, with $ 1 billion more than we guided, and this reflects our commitment to returning capital. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $8.75 billion of shares as part of our $20 billion repurchase plan. We ended the quarter at a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.2%, over 100 bps above our regulatory requirement at quarter end.\nThe agreement with Fernando Chico Pardo, to purchase a 25% equity stake is a very significant step towards the divestiture of Banamex and progresses the overall time line to deconsolidation and beyond. We are confident that this path is in the best interest of our stakeholders in terms of certainty and value, and we could not be more pleased to Fernando with this proven track record for investors as our partner.\nAs we simplify, we continue to invest in technology to catalyze our transformation and become a more agile and modern bank. We have been relentless in our execution, and it is creating results. Over 2/3 of our transformation programs are at or are close to our target state, and we're making very good progress in the remaining areas. I'm particularly pleased with the improvement in our controls this year through standardizing, automating and digitizing them.\nWe continue to lead in digital payments innovation, enabling payments, clearing and settlement capabilities to operate on an always-on basis across multiple borders and currencies. As networks evolve towards an always-on future, we are taking the next step by integrating Citi token services with our 24/7 clearing platform. Now this integration will allow Citi clients to seamlessly send funds to third-party banks real time within our U.S. dollar tiering network and that's delivering true interoperability across more than 250 institutions.\nWe are committed to embedding AI into how we work. Nearly 180,000 colleagues in 83 countries now have access to our proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year. These tools have hours each day by automating routine work, analyzing data and creating materials in minutes instead of hours.\nOur services and USPB teams are using AI to resolve client inquiries faster. In Wealth, advisers are gaining real-time insights that help them deliver more personalized advice. And AI-driven automated code reviews have exceeded 1 million so far this year and are dramatically improving our developers' productivity. This innovation alone saves considerable time and creates around 100,000 hours of weekly capacity as a very meaningful productivity uplift.\nIn September, we launched a pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues. It allows complex multistep tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead.\nFinally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk and improve client experience.\nTaking a step back, the macro environment reflects the global economy that's proved more resilient than many anticipated. The U.S. continues to be a pace setter, driven by consistent consumer spending as well as tech investments in AI and data centers. That said, there were pockets of valuation frothiness in the market. So I hope discipline remains. But overall, while growth is cooling somewhat, and we're keeping an eye on the labor market, America's economic engine is indeed still coming.\nIn Asia, China's domestic spending has slowed. However, the investments they are making in technology are staggering, and the world should take notice. India's fundamentals of the young tech-savvy labor force and robust domestic consumption continued to drive high growth there. But in Europe, structural challenges still need to be dealt with for the continent to escape this low growth cycle. One certainty through all of this is our commitment and ability to serve our clients with excellence no matter what challenge they face.\nAs you can see, the steady and disciplined execution of our strategy is delivering better business performance quarter after quarter and improving our returns. The cumulative effect of what we have done over the past years, our transformation, our fresh strategy, our simplification, have put Citi in a materially different place in terms of our ability to compete. We know success isn't linear, but I am so proud of the progress our people have made and how things are coming together.\nWe intend to end the year with momentum into 2026 as we close in on our medium-term return target. In terms of what will come next, we very much look forward to sharing that with you at our next Investor Day, which will be on May 7 of next year. There is still so much upside left for us to capture, and we look forward to laying out how we are going to do it.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Mark, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the performance of our businesses in greater detail. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. This quarter, we reported net income of $3.8 billion, EPS of $1.86 and an ROTCE of 8% on $22.1 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and each of our 5 businesses. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of a notable item consisting of the goodwill impairment that Jane mentioned earlier, we reported net income of $4.5 billion, EPS of $2.24 and an ROTCE of 9.7%. Total revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in each of our businesses and legacy franchises, partially offset by a decline in corporate other. Net interest income, excluding markets, which you can see on the bottom left side of the slide, was up 6%, driven by USPB, services, wealth, legacy franchises and banking, partially offset by a decline in corporate other.\nNoninterest revenues, excluding markets, were up 12% as better results in banking, wealth and legacy franchises were partially offset by declines in Corporate/Other, services and USPB. And total markets revenues were up 15%. Expenses of $14.3 billion were up 9%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I just mentioned. On an adjusted basis, expenses of $13.6 billion were up 3%.\nCost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in U.S. card as well as a firm-wide net ACL build.\nLooking at the firm on a year-to-date basis, total revenues were up 7%, driven by growth in each of our 5 businesses, along with the benefit of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by a decline in all other. Expenses, which have also been impacted by foreign exchange translation, were up 2% and flat on an adjusted basis. We've generated positive operating leverage for the full firm and each of our 5 businesses and reported an ROTCE of 8.6% and 9.2% on an adjusted basis.\nOn Slide 7, we show the expense and efficiency trend over the past 5 quarters. On an adjusted basis, this quarter, we improved our efficiency ratio by approximately 360 basis points. The increase in adjusted expenses was driven by higher compensation and benefits along with the impact of foreign exchange translation. As you can see on the bottom right side of the slide, the increase in compensation and benefits was driven by performance-related compensation, higher severance and investment in transformation and technology, [indiscernible] productivity and stranded cost reduction partially offsetting continued growth in the businesses. Year-to-date, we have incurred approximately $650 million of severance, slightly above our original expectation for the full year.\nAs we've said in the past, we are very focused on managing our expense base in a disciplined manner, reducing stranded costs and generating productivity savings to largely self-fund investments in transformation, technology and the businesses. This discipline, combined with top line revenue momentum, will continue to drive improvement in our operating efficiency.\nOn Slide 8, we show consumer and corporate credit metrics. As I mentioned, the firm's cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in U.S. card as well as a firm-wide net ACL build. Our reserves continue to incorporate an 8-quarter weighted average unemployment rate of 5.2%, which includes a downside scenario average unemployment rate of nearly 7%. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $24 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.7%. We continue to maintain a high credit quality card portfolio with approximately 85% consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher, and a reserve to funded loan ratio in our card portfolio of 8%. And it's worth noting that across our U.S. card portfolios, delinquency and NCL rate continue to perform in line with our expectations.\nLooking at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that our corporate exposure is primarily investment grade. And while corporate nonaccrual loans increased in the quarter, resulting from idiosyncratic downgrade, they remain low as do corporate net credit losses. We feel good about the high-quality nature of our portfolios, which reflect our risk appetite framework and our focus on using the balance sheet in the context of the overall client relationship.\nTurning to capital and the balance sheet on Slide 9, where I will speak to sequential variance. Our $2.6 trillion balance sheet increased 1%, driven by growth in cash and loans. End-of-period loans increased 1%, driven by markets and service. Our $1.4 trillion deposit base remains well diversified and increased 2%, driven by services and wealth. We reported a 115% average LCR and maintained over $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.2% CET1 capital ratio, which is 110 basis points above our 12.1% regulatory capital requirement during the third quarter.\nEffective October 1, our new standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement is 11.6%, which incorporates the reduction in our SCB from 4.1% to 3.6%. That said, we're still waiting for clarity from the Federal Reserve on whether the averaging of SCB results from the previous 2 consecutive years will become effective in the next few months. Given this uncertainty, we will be targeting a standardized CET1 ratio closer to 12.8%, which incorporates a 2-year average SCB of 3.8% as well as a 100-basis-point management buffer.\nAs we've said in the past, we remain very focused on efficient utilization of both standardized and advanced RWA while providing the businesses with the capital needed to pursue accretive growth opportunities. And we will continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders through buybacks as evidenced by the $5 billion of buybacks in the third quarter and nearly $9 billion year-to-date.\nTurning to the businesses on Slide 10. We show the results for Services in the third quarter. Revenues were up 7%, driven by growth across both TTS and security services. NII increased 11%, primarily driven by the increase in average deposit balances as well as higher deposit spreads. While NIR was down 3% due to the impact of higher lending revenue share, total fee revenue was up 6%. We see very strong activity and engagement with corporate clients and momentum across underlying fee drivers with cross-border transactions up 10% and U.S. dollar clearing volume up 5% and assets under custody and administration, up 13% as we continue to roll out our innovative products and services with digital capabilities into new markets.\nExpenses increased 5%, primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits, including severance as well as higher volume and other revenue-related expenses. Average loans increased 8% driven by continued demand for trade loans as we continue to support clients as they plan for potential shifts in trade corridors. Average deposits also increased 8% and with growth across both North America and International, largely driven by an increase in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.8 billion, with an ROTCE of 28.9% in the quarter and 26.1% year-to-date.\nTurning to markets on Slide 11. Revenues were up 15%, driven by growth across both fixed income and equity. Fixed income revenues increased 12% with rates and currencies up 15%, largely driven by growth in rates amid policy uncertainty and elevated client activity. And spread products and other fixed income was up 8%, largely driven by higher mortgage trading, higher financing activity and lower commodities activity. Equities revenues were up 24%, driven by higher client activity in derivatives and increased volumes in cash as well as continued momentum in prime with balances up approximately 44%. Expenses increased 5%, primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits along with the impact of FX translation. Transactional and product servicing expenses were down as growth in transaction volumes was more than offset by efficiency actions.\nAverage loans increased 24%, primarily driven by financing activity and spread products. Markets generated positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.6 billion with an ROTCE of 12.3% in the quarter and 13.5% year-to-date.\nTurning to banking on Slide 12. We revenues were up 34%, driven by growth in corporate lending and investment banking. Investment banking fees increased 17% with growth across all products. M&A was up 8% with momentum across several sectors and with continued share gains with financial sponsors and more sell-side activity.\nECM was up 35%, with growth across all products, notably in convertibles given the favorable environment. And DCM was up 19%, driven by leverage finance. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 39%, driven by an increase in lending revenue share. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher volume-related transactional and product servicing expenses as well as compensation and benefit, which includes recent investments we've made in the business. Cost of credit was $157 million, which included a net ACL build of $148 million driven by changes in portfolio composition, including exposure growth.\nBanking generated positive operating leverage for the seventh consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $638 million with an ROTCE of 12.3% in the quarter and 10.7% year-to-date.\nTurning to Wealth on Slide 13. Revenues were up 8%, driven by growth in Citigold and the Private Bank partially offset by a decline in wealth at work. NII, which you can see on the bottom left side of the slide, increased 8%, driven by higher deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage spreads. NIR increased 9%, driven by higher investment fee revenues as we grew client investment assets by 14% despite a reduction of approximately $33 billion related to the sale of our trust business. We had record net new investment assets of $18.6 billion in the quarter and over $52 billion in the last 12 months, representing approximately 9% organic growth. Expenses increased 4%, driven by investments in technology and volume-related transactional and product servicing expenses, partially offset by continued productivity savings.\nEnd-of-period client balances continued to grow, up 8%. Average loans were up 1% as we continue to be strategic in deploying the balance sheet to support growth in client investment assets. Average deposits were flat as operating outflows and a shift from deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform were offset by net new deposits as well as client transfers from USPB. Wealth had a pretax margin of 22%, generated positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $374 million, with an ROTCE of 12.1% in the quarter and 12.5% year-to-date.\nTurning to U.S. Personal Banking on Slide 14. Revenues were up 7%, driven by growth in branded cards and retail banking, partially offset by a slight decline in retail service. Branded cards revenues increased 8%, driven by higher loan spreads, higher interest-earning balances, which were up 5%, and higher gross interchange partially offset by higher rewards costs. We continue to see strong customer engagement with spend volume also up 5%. Retail banking revenues increased 30%, largely driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads and balances. And retail services revenues were down 1%, largely driven by higher partner payment accruals.\nExpenses were flat as lower advertising and marketing expenses as well as compensation and benefits, were offset by higher volume-related transactional and product servicing expenses. Cost of credit was $1.8 billion, driven by net credit losses in card. Average deposits increased 6% as net new deposits were partially offset by the client transfers to wealth that I mentioned earlier. USPB generated positive operating leverage for the 12th consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $858 million with an ROTCE of 14.5% in the quarter and 12.9% year-to-date. Turning to Slide 15, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues were down 16% and with a decline in corporate other, partially offset by an increase in legacy franchise. The decline in corporate other was driven by lower NII resulting from actions that we've taken over the past few quarters to reduce the asset sensitivity of the firm in a declining rate environment as well as lower NIR. Growth in legacy franchises was driven by Mexico, which included the impact of Mexican peso appreciation partially offset by the impact of continued reduction from our exit and wind down market.\nExpenses increased 4% with growth in Corporate/Other, which included higher severance, largely offset by a decline in legacy franchise. And cost of credit was $331 million, primarily consisting of net credit losses of $297 million, driven by consumer loans in Mexico. As you can see on the bottom right side of the slide, divestiture-related expense items in the quarter included the $726 million goodwill impairment, which is capital neutral, and based on the fair value of 100% of the entity.\nOn Slide 16, we provide an overview of the agreement with Fernando Chico Pardo, to purchase a 25% equity stake in Banamex. This transaction progresses the overall time line to exit Banamex, but is subject to certain closing conditions and local regulatory approvals. Before I walk through the financial impacts related to this stake at closing, I'd like to ensure you understand the net capital impact at a full exit.\nThe cumulative capital benefit to Citi upon full exit will be driven by 2 things: one, the capital release associated with the RWA reduction; and two, the cumulative impact of any potential gains and losses on sales. However, between now and then, there will be a few steps to get there. And it starts with this transaction. So looking at the right-hand side of the page, at the time of close and subject to the book value of Banamex at closing, we expect assets to increase by approximately $2.3 billion for the total consideration paid for the 25% stake, which reflects the fixed price-to-book value multiple of 0.8. And total equity will also increase by a net $2.3 billion, but it will be driven by a few factors. First, there will be a temporary benefit to stockholders' equity due to the reclassification of the negative cumulative translation adjustment from stockholders' equity to noncontrolling interest, which will be slightly offset by the loss on sale. Second, the noncontrolling interest will increase by the 25% of the Banamex book value sold, but this will be largely offset by the CTA that was reclassified as part of this transaction. So net-net, a $2.3 billion increase in assets, and on the equity side, a $1.8 billion increase in stockholders' equity and a $500 million increase in noncontrolling interest.\nAt deconsolidation, there will be balance sheet impacts and P&L impact. As it relates to the balance sheet, all of Banamex assets and liabilities will be removed from our balance sheet and be partially offset by any remaining equity stake.\nIn terms of the P&L, the entire amount of the cumulative translation adjustment related to Banamex, which is approximately $9 billion, will flow through the P&L as a loss and will reverse the temporary capital benefit from prior sales. Therefore, at deconsolidation, the cumulative impact of CTA is capital neutral.\nSo to wrap it up, while there are a number of accounting nuances between now and full exit, the cumulative capital impact to Citi will be the full release of RWA associated with Banamex and the cumulative impact of any potential gains and losses on sales.\nTurning to the full year 2025 outlook on Slide 17. Before I get into the outlook, I want to say how proud I am of the company as we execute against our strategy and drive top line revenue growth, which continues to be fueled by our investments across the businesses and in key areas such as technology and data. We've made significant progress in terms of improving return with an adjusted year-to-date ROTCE of 9.2%.\nSo now with regard to the outlook. Given the very strong year-to-date top line revenue growth of 7%, we remain confident in our ability to exceed $84 billion in revenues for the year. We now expect NII ex markets to be up around 5.5% for the full year, incorporating stronger performance as well as the impact of FX relative to our previous expectations. For NIR ex markets, we expect continued momentum in underlying fee drivers. And in markets, historically, we've seen revenues decline 15% to 20% from the third to fourth quarter. However, given the strong performance in the third quarter, the sequential decline could exceed that range this year.\nNow turning to expenses. Our year-to-date expense base incorporates both the level and mix of revenue we've seen as well as the impact of FX. And given what I just mentioned about revenues, full year expenses will come in higher than we previously guided. However, you should expect the efficiency ratio for the full year to be consistent with the revenue and expense guidance that we provided during the course of the year, which is slightly below 64% excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment this quarter. In terms of credit, our expectations for the year remain unchanged, and we will continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter under our $20 billion program.\nAs we take a step back, the performance in the quarter and so far this year represents significant progress towards our goal of improved firm-wide and business performance. We remain steadfast and focused on executing our transformation, achieving our ROTCE target of 10% to 11% next year and further improving returns over time. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Please enter your conference ID and press the pound key.\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the Q2 2025 Citi Earnings Call. Please stand by for the call to begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThe conference is in presentation mode. Your line is muted. This call is being recorded.\n\nOperator\n\n[audio distortion]\nHello and welcome to Citi's Q2 2025 Earnings Call. Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our Q2 2025 earnings call. I'm joined today by our Executive Officer Jane Fraser and our Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website Citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Thank you, Jen. And a very good morning to everyone. This morning we reported another very good quarter with net income of $4 billion and earnings per share of $1.96 with an ROTCE of 8.7%.\nRevenues were up 8% and three of our five businesses had record Q2 revenues. We again had positive operating leverage at each business and the group level. We continue to demonstrate that our strong performance is sustainable through different environments. In April, I'd said that we were ready to lean in despite the lack of clarity of the moment, and indeed we have. We are executing our strategy with discipline and intensity. We're improving the performance and returns of each of our businesses while advancing their strategic positions and share. We are making significant progress on our transformation. Turning to our five businesses, Services continues to show why this high-returning business with 23% ROTCE for the quarter is our crown jewel. Revenue is up 8% with robust growth in both loans and deposits.\nUnderlying fee drivers, such as cross-border activity and U.S. dollar clearing, grew nicely, and we grew our AUCA to over $28 trillion. Markets revenues were up 16%, the best second quarter since 2020 in fixed income. The flows we saw in rates and currencies were particularly strong, backed by client momentum including hedging activity as well as improved monetization. Equities had the best second quarter ever as our prime balances hit a record with sentiment improving significantly as the quarter progressed. Banking revenues were up 18%. We continue to be at the center of some of the most significant transactions including serving as the exclusive advisor to Boeing on the $11 billion sale of Jefferson and as lead advisor to Nippon Steel on their $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel. Halfway through the year we have been involved in 7 of the top 10 investment banking fee events.\nIn addition to sustained momentum in M&A, we continue to take share in leveraged finance and with sponsors, a priority area. We also took share in equity capital markets with convertibles fueling a strong quarter. Wealth delivered a pre-tax margin of 29% as revenues were up 20% with each line of business growing significantly, and non-interest revenue up17%. While we have had 9% organic growth over the last year in net new investment assets, we did see inflows slow this quarter as clients were cautious amid macro uncertainty. We are confident we will see a pickup here as markets have recovered. In USPB we grew revenues by 6% as we continue to focus on product innovation, digital capabilities, and the customer experience.\nWe saw significant growth in branded cards while retail services was pressured by lower sales activity at our partners, and we continue to feel good about the quality and the mix of our portfolio as well as our healthy level of reserves, and retail banking had a very good quarter underpinned by improving deposit spreads. During the quarter, we returned over $3 billion in capital to our common shareholders, which includes $2 billion in share repurchases on a year-to-date basis. We repurchased $3.75 billion of shares as part of our $20 billion repurchase tax plan. We ended the quarter at a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.5%, 140 basis points above our current regulatory requirement. We were pleased with the results of our recent stress test.\nWe are well positioned to continue to increase the return of capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which is a priority for us, as well as an increased dividend of $0.60 per share beginning in Q3. The results of the recent stress test also show how we have de risked the company by implementing a more focused business model, which includes divesting our international consumer businesses, with Poland, our last remaining sale, expected to close next year. I am particularly pleased that the momentum across our franchise includes the transformation as well. The investments we have made are improving our risk and control environment. Many of our programs are at or near target state, and we are making good progress in the remaining areas. We continue to focus on streamlining processes and platforms and driving automation to reduce manual touch points.\nWe're also increasingly deploying AI tools to support these efforts in areas such as data quality, and we remain on track with our data plan. As all of this work progresses, we are confident that our transformation expenses will start to decrease next year. But transformation is hardly the only recipient of investment. We continue to make investments that enhance the competitiveness of our businesses. For example, we aim to deliver the benefits of advancements in stablecoin and digital assets to our clients in a safe and sound manner by modernizing our own infrastructure and improving efficiency, transparency, and interoperability for our clients. As a leading global bank in the space, we are laser focused on innovations which enable clients to access real-time 24/7 payments, clearing, and settlement across borders and across currencies.\nCiti Token Services, our leading digital asset solution, is now live in four major markets with more to come and has processed billions of dollars of transactions since its launch. In markets, investments in our trading platforms have allowed us to handle record volumes with ease in wealth. Our partnership with iCapital will provide an end-to-end solution for our alternative investment offerings. As you saw with the American Airlines extension and the refreshed Costco Anywhere Visa Card, we're investing in our card portfolio to deliver more value for our cardholders. Later this quarter we will introduce a new proprietary premium credit card, Citi Strata Elite, to our rewards family of products to expand our offering for affluent customers. In terms of investing in talent, our momentum and value proposition continue to attract great leaders to the firm, as you've seen recently in banking and wealth.\nJust as importantly, we are giving our talent the tools and the resources to compete and to win. Now let's turn to the environment. Well, it's proven to be more resilient than most of us anticipated, but we are dropping our guard as we begin the second half of the year. We expect to see goods prices to start ticking up over the summer as tariffs take effect, and we have seen pauses in CapEx and hiring among our client base. All of that said, the strength of the U.S. economy driven by the American entrepreneur and a healthy consumer has certainly been exceeding expectations of late. As I've been speaking to CEOs, I've yet again been impressed by the adaptability of our private sector aided by the depth and breadth of the American capital markets.\nI believe our results over the past year will help you see why we have been so confident in our trajectory. Our people have been performing with excellence in an unpredictable macro environment and I am so proud of them. The need for what we can uniquely provide for clients remains in very high demand and we will continue to deliver for them through our One Citi approach through the second half of the year and beyond. Our wealth business is now starting to truly benefit from not only our retail bank but our global network. By aligning client coverage and deploying credit more strategically, we're deepening relationships with asset managers and private market clients across services, markets, banking, and wealth. Importantly, we are gaining share of mind as well as share of wallet. We will remain relentlessly focused on execution.\nAs I've said, next year's 10% to 11% ROTCE target. It's a waypoint; it's not a destination. The actions we have taken have set up Citi to succeed long term, drive returns above that level, and continue to create value for shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Mark, and then we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the performance of our businesses in greater detail. On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. This quarter, we reported net income of $4 billion, EPS of $1.96, and an ROTCE of 8.7% on $21.7 billion of revenue, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and each of our five businesses. Total revenues were up 8%, driven by growth in each of our businesses, partially offset by a decline in all others. Net interest income excluding markets, which you can see on the bottom left side of the slide, was up 7%, driven by services, USPB, and wealth, partially offset by a decline in corporate others.\nNon-interest revenues excluding markets were up 1% as better results in banking and wealth were offset by declines in legacy franchises, USPB, and total markets. Revenues were up 16%, expenses of $13.6 billion were up 2%. Provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion primarily consisting of net credit losses in US cards as well as a firm-wide net ACL build driven by services, banking, and legacy franchise. Looking at the firm on a year-to-date basis, total revenues were up 5% driven by growth in each of our five businesses, partially offset by a decline in all others, and expenses were down 1% as we generated positive operating leverage for the firm and each of our five businesses and reported an ROTCE of 8.9%. On slide seven we show the expense trend over the past five quarters.\nThe expense increase this quarter was driven by higher compensation and benefits, largely offset by lower tax and deposit insurance costs, as well as the absence of civil money penalties in the prior year. The increase in compensation and benefits was driven by higher severance, primarily related to the realignment of our technology workforce, volume, and other revenue-related expenses and investments in transformation and technology, with productivity and stranded cost reduction partially offsetting continued growth in the businesses. As we've said in the past, we are very focused on bringing down our expense base through reduction of stranded costs and productivity savings, both of which allow us to self-fund our additional investments in transformation, technology, and the businesses. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $23.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.7%. Approximately 85% of our card portfolio is to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher, and our reserve to funded loan ratio in the card portfolio was 8%. It's worth noting that we are seeing an improvement in our card credit trend. Looking at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that approximately 80% of our corporate exposure is investment-grade, including international exposure, of which approximately 90% is either investment-grade or exposure to multinationals and their subsidiary. On the bottom-right side of the slide, you can see that our corporate non-accrual loans increased in the quarter, resulting from idiosyncratic downgrades, but remain low.\nWe feel good about the high quality nature of our portfolio which reflect our risk appetite framework and our focus on using the balance sheet in the context of the overall client relationship. Turning to capital and balance sheet on slide 9 where I will speak to sequential variances, our $2.6 trillion balance sheet increased 2% with growth in cash and loans partially offset by lower trading related assets. End of period loans increased 3%, primarily driven by markets and USPB. Our $1.4 trillion deposit base remains well diversified and increased 3% driven by services. We reported a 115% average LCR and maintained over $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio which incorporates a 100 basis point management buffer and is 140 basis points above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.1%.\nAs we announced earlier this month, under the current stress capital buffer framework for the standardized approach, we would expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease from 12.1%-11.6%, which incorporates the expected reduction in our SCB from 4.1%-3.6%. That being said, we await the finalization of the Federal Reserve's proposed rulemaking to reduce variability in the SCB, which includes averaging results from the previous two consecutive years and modifying the annual effective date from October 1-January 1. If the averaging were to be implemented as the proposal is written, we expect our SCB to be 3.8%. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our quarterly common dividend to $0.60 per share following the SCB result effective in Q3.\nOverall, we were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results and the corresponding reduction in our SCB for the second consecutive year. Even with these reductions, we remain very focused on efficient utilization of both standardized and advanced RWA. Turning to the businesses on Slide 10, we show the results for services in the second quarter. Revenues were up 8%, driven by growth across both TTS and Securities Services. NII increased 13%, driven by an increase in average deposit and loan balances, as well as higher deposit spreads, partially offset by lower loan spreads. NIR was down 1%, as continued growth in fees was more than offset by higher lending revenue share.\nWe continued to see strong activity and engagement with corporate clients and momentum across most underlying fee drivers, including cross-border transactions, assets under custody and administration, and U.S. dollar clearing, with total fee revenue up 6%, which we've included on the bottom left side of the slide. Expenses declined 2% driven by the absence of tax- and legal-related expenses in the prior year, largely offset by higher compensation and benefits, including severance, as well as technology costs. We continue to make investments in our platform and products to win new clients and deepen with existing clients. Provision for credit losses was $353 million driven by a net ACL build of $333 million primarily related to transfer risk associated with our clients' activities in Russia. Average loans increased 15% driven by continued demand for trade loans globally as our clients expand their operations and suppliers.\nAverage deposits increased 7% with growth across both international and North America largely driven by an increase in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.4 billion with an ROTCE of 23.3% in the quarter and 24.7% year-to-date. Turning to Markets on Slide 11, revenues were up 16% driven by growth across both fixed income and equities. Fixed income revenues increased 20% with rates and currencies up 27% reflecting increased client activity and monetization across both corporates and financial institutions. Spread products and other fixed income was up 3% driven by higher financing activity and loan growth partially offset by lower credit trading. Equities revenues were up 6% excluding the impact of the Visa B exchange offer in the prior year.\n\nOperator\n\nEquities revenues were up over 35% with solid growth across all products driven by momentum in prime services with record balances up approximately 27% as well as higher client activity and volumes in cash equity, and strong monetization of market activity and derivatives. Expenses increased 6% largely driven by higher volume and other revenue-related expenses. Cost of credit was $108 million driven by a net ACL build of $100 million due to changes in portfolio composition, including exposure growth. Average loans increased 14% driven by financing activity and spreads. Markets generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.7 billion with an ROTCE of 13.8% in the quarter and 14% year-to-date.\nTurning to banking on Slide 12, revenues were up 18% driven by growth in corporate lending and investment banking partially offset by the impact of mark to market on loan hedges. Investment banking fees increased 13% with growth in M&A and ECM partially offset by a decline in DCM. M&A was up 52% with gains across a multitude of sectors and with financial sponsors. DCM was up 25% with strength in convertibles and IPOs as markets stabilized late in the quarter, and while DCM was down 12% as our investment grade volumes decreased versus very strong performance in the prior year, we continued to gain share in leverage finance. Corporate lending revenues excluding mark to market on loan hedges increased 31% primarily driven by the impact of higher lending.\nRevenue share expenses were up 1% as higher volume and other revenue-related expenses and continued business investment were primarily offset by benefits of our prior actions to rightsize the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $173 million, which included a net ACL build of $157 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition, including sequential growth in lending. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $463 million, with an ROTCE of 9% in the quarter and 9.8% year-to-date. Turning to wealth on Slide 13, revenues were up 20% with growth across Citigold, the private bank, and Wealth at Work. NII, which you can see on the bottom left side of the slide, increased 22%, driven by higher deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage spreads and lower deposit balances.\nNIR increased 17% driven by an $80 million gain on the sale of our Alternatives Fund platform to iCapital, as well as higher investment fee revenue as we grew client investment assets by 17%. Expenses were up 1% as higher volume and other revenue-related expenses, episodic items, and severance were primarily offset by benefits from continued actions to right size the expense base and lower deposit insurance costs. End of period client balances continued to grow, up 9%. Average loans declined 1% as we continue to be strategic in deploying the balance sheet to support growth in client investment assets. Average deposits declined 3%, driven by taxes and other operating outflows, as well as a shift from deposits to higher-yielding investments on our platform, partially offset by client transfers from USPB, reflecting our ability to support clients as their wealth and investment needs evolve.\nWealth had a pretax margin of 29%, generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $494 million with an ROTCE of 16.1% in the quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. Turning to U.S. Personal Banking on Slide 14, revenues grew 6% driven by growth in branded cards and retail banking, partially offset by a decline in retail services. Branded cards revenues increased 11% driven by net interest margin expansion and growth in interest-earning balances, which were up 7%. We continue to see growth in spend volume, which was up 4%. Retail banking revenues increased 16% driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads, and retail services revenues declined 5%, largely driven by higher partner payments due to lower net credit losses. Expenses were up 1%. Cost of credit was $1.9 billion, driven by net credit losses in card.\nAverage deposits declined 3% as net new deposits were more than offset by client transfers to wealth that I mentioned earlier. USPB generated positive operating leverage for the 11th consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $649 million, with an ROTCE of 11.1% in the quarter and 12% year-to-date. Turning to Slide 15, where we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues declined 14%, with declines across both corporate other and legacy franchise. The decline in corporate other was driven by lower NII resulting from actions that we've taken over the past few quarters to reduce the asset sensitivity of the firm in a declining rate environment.\nLegacy franchises was driven by the impact of the Mexican peso depreciation, expiration of TSAs in our closed exit market, and continued reduction from our wind down markets, largely offset by underlying growth in Banamex. Expenses increased 8%, with growth in corporate other, which included higher severance, largely offset by lower expenses in legacy franchise, and cost of credit was $374 million, largely consisting of net credit losses of $256 million driven by consumer loans in Banamex. Turning to the full year 2025 outlook on slide 16, given the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect to be at the higher end of our full year revenue range, around $84 billion, with net interest income excluding markets up closer to 4% as it relates to expenses.\nAs a reminder, both the level of revenue and the mix of revenue inform and impact our expense base, which we expect to be around $53.4 billion this year. However, if revenues were to come in above $84 billion, we would expect expenses to come in higher as well, commensurate with the increase in revenue. As a reminder, currency fluctuations may impact both revenue and expenses in the balance of the year, but tend to be roughly neutral to earnings. In terms of credit, given the improvement that we've seen in both delinquency and net credit loss rates in both cards portfolios, we expect net credit losses to be within the range of 3.5%-4% for branded cards and 5.75% to 6.25% for retail service, and the ACL will continue to be a function of the macroeconomic environment and business volume.\nNow turning to capital, we remain committed to repurchasing shares each quarter under our $20 billion share repurchase program, and expect to buy back at least $4 billion this quarter. That said, going forward you should not expect us to provide precise buyback guidance on a quarterly basis as we take a step back. The performance in the quarter and so far this year represents significant progress towards our goal of improved firmwide and business performance. We are proud of what we've accomplished, and we are well on our way to delivering the full power of our franchise. We remain steadfast and focused on executing on our transformation, achieving our ROTCE target of 10% to 11% next year, and further improving returns over time. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nAt this time, we'll open the floor for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press Star 5 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself at any time by pressing Star 5 again. Please note you'll be allowed one question and one follow-up question. Again, that is Star 5 to ask a question. We'll pause for just a moment.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Our first question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nOh, hey. Hey. Good morning, Jane and Mark. Jane, good morning. You've talked about next year's 10, 11% ROTCE target as a waypoint. You've said that a few times now. I know you're not going to give any hard targets for 2027. Can you give us a sense of what you think the long term return profile could look like roughly, and what you see as the key drivers to higher returns beyond 2026?\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nYeah, I would be delighted to do so. You're right, I'm not going to be giving a target at this juncture.\nI feel very confident about our path forward. I think you can see this quarter the firm is firing on all cylinders. We have the confidence of the right strategy. We're uniquely positioned to support our cross border clients. Mark and I both feel very pleased about how it's all coming together, both within and across the five businesses. We've got this simpler, yet diversified, business model. We're in a strong financial position, feel very good about the leadership team, and we've got those hard and strategic decisions behind us, so we can be on the front foot.\nI feel confident, first of all, about the target for next year. As I've said, the 10%-11% target is this waypoint, it's not the destination. We're managing the firm for the longer term with a good trajectory. There are three drivers of higher long-term returns: revenues, expenses, and capital. Mark, I'll take revenues, I'll hand to you on the expense and capital front. On the revenue growth, you've seen us grow very steadily over the past few years in a, let's call them, a variety of different macro environments. This quarter is a strong continuation of that. As I'm looking forward, banking, we've talked about continued share growth. We're very pleased with the M&A front. The pipeline's excellent, and the associated revenues around greater activity.\nOn the episodic front, I think the linkage between banking and markets there is particularly pleasing.\nWith services.\nWe will just continue growing with new clients and with existing clients. We pointed to very strong new client wins this quarter. A lot of new suppliers we've been bringing on, but also the new product innovations. I'm sure we'll talk about digital assets at some point on this call. I feel very good about the crown jewel continuing to deliver in wealth. We've got great investments, runway, and just huge upside. You can tell the excitement from Andy and the team, from our existing clients, the famous $5 trillion, as well as the opportunity with the new wealth creators. We're very much that private bank for the progress makers in the world. In markets, great quarter, but equities. I think the piece I like here is that we've now got that second leg to the strength that we have in derivatives, which is in prime.\nThat platform is scaled. We're continuing to invest in it. It's got very high return, marginal return that comes with the growth. Expect to see us continue there. Volatility is going to, I suspect, be a feature, not a bug of the new world order, and we will benefit from that. Again, in Markets, the private market space as capital market evolves is an area our financing business is done very well positioned. Again, strong connectivity with banking here for us to continue to grow, take share, and help participate in, not to mention FX options. Finally, U.S. Personal Banking. We've got a wonderful relationship with American Airlines. We've got a very exciting 2026 lined up. You've seen us with new product innovations this year with the Strata Elite coming out later on in the quarter.\nRetail banking, again, really hitting its stride now and feeding both wealth, but also the broader NAM franchise. I feel good on the revenue side, Mark, come, let me pass to you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nKey point, obviously, revenue momentum. Another key point is continued expense discipline. I think you've seen that through the first half and obviously the targets we've set for 2025, but that continues in 2026. Beyond the drivers, there are likely to be, you know, continued reduction in severance. We talked about 2025 having a sizable severance estimate in our forecast. The transformation expenses, which are going up in 2025, will trend down over time. The stranded costs, which have been coming down, we brought stranded costs down by about $3 billion. There's still about $1.2 billion left that will trend down over the next couple of years, and then continue productivity, some of which will be enabled by AI that Jane mentioned earlier. Those are a number of the drivers that we think will contribute to the continued expense discipline.\nI use discipline intentionally because in order to capture that revenue momentum that we've seen in the first half and that Jane outlined as drivers of the forward look, it's going to require continued investment, and part of our responsibility is going to be driving efficiencies while making investments that allow for us to play for the longer term returns and better serve our clients. Revenue, momentum, expense discipline, and then finally capital and continuing to be efficient about how we use our risk weighted assets and capital. You heard me mention earlier us increasing our buybacks to at least $4 billion in the quarter, and we'll continue to be good stewards of our capital as we manage through 2026 and beyond. Well, that's a very fulsome response. I appreciate it.\nYou didn't have another question, Jane, did you? Did have one little follow up on the revenue forecast for this year. The guidance. I appreciate going to the higher end, but I guess if I look at first half $43.3 billion, to get to $84 billion, you're dropping $2.5 billion in the back half. I think last year you kind of fell half that. Is there something we should be thinking about? Is it just being cautious? There is seasonality, I know, in Markets. Just trying to think through why the big step back down in the second half given the momentum. Sure, I'll keep it brief. I think we did have a very strong first half.\nThere was obviously a great deal of uncertainty and volatility that we managed through and helped our clients manage through. The second half does seasonally tend to be softer than the first half. We're certainly estimating that as we think about the $84 billion in the high end of that range that we've moved you to, that would include a Markets second half that is down generally consistent with what we've seen historically versus the first half. Obviously, if there's increased volatility and repositioning that investor clients want to take on the heels of that, we'll see how that plays out. That's an important factor that's playing through in the $84 billion. On the NIIX Markets part, we do expect to see continued loan growth and operating deposit growth play through in a rate environment that is probably with fewer cuts than we expected originally.\nWe have factored in some normal seasonality in the second half juxtaposed against the first. That's driving us to the high end of the range.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Eric Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, hi, good morning. My first question is on capital. Mark, I appreciate that you're moving away from the quarterly buyback guide. I'm wondering, two questions. One, is 13:1 still the right level in terms of the year-end target as we think about, you know, regulatory reform and SCB relief, and additionally, you know, you're operating in a 140 basis point buffer. You know, as we think about a regulatory reform construct that's supposed to reduce volatility in the capital minimum, when do you think is the right time to readdress that buffer?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nSure. Look, in terms of the target for the end of the year, I think it's important, as I said in the prepared remarks, to acknowledge that one, we've seen our SCB come down in the most recent batch results for now a second year in a row. With that said, there's still some uncertainty as to what the SCB will ultimately be. The reduction will be depending on whether it's an average of the last two years or not, as well as the timing for it, whether that will be the normal or historical 1 October date or whether that will move to 1 January. Both of those factors impact the answer to your question in terms of whether there is, you know, whether the 13.1 is still the year-end target or whether it's something different from that.\nUntil we get clarity on that, we are continuing down the path of returning, you know, as much capital as we originally had planned for, you know, when I set that target. As we get clarity, we will adjust accordingly. I think importantly what you see is us pulling forward buybacks as much as we can, as early as we can, while obviously being responsible about it and taking advantage of the fact that we're still trading below book value and it makes sense to do that. That's how I think about the.\nWhat I will say is regardless of the outcome of averaging or the start of the new SCB level, it does afford us more flexibility in the way of how much capital we have to buy back or redeploy. We'll continue to kind of assess that in terms of the management buffer. We look at that on a regular basis. As I've told you in the past, it's an internal management buffer. Its size is in part with how we think about volatility in RWA and AOCI, as well as variability in the SCB. We're pleased with the direction and tone that we're hearing from DC in terms of looking at capital in a more holistic way.\nAs we continue to get clarity on that, we'll continue to assess how much of a management buffer is required. In the meantime, we're still running it at the 100 basis points.\n\nEric Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nMy second question is, I know how important it is to, you know, work on lifting that 2020 OCC consent order. I'm wondering, as you know, we think about, you know, some of the costs associated with transformation. You know, is there a way to size, you know, if the consent, when the consent order is lifted, you know, what expenses that could be freed up to reallocate to the rest of the company. Now I know you've talked about this, you know, with investors in the past, you know, and you know, you had another peer that had talked about freeing up expenses as consent orders were resolved. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more clarity here.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nWell, you know, first I'd say, as Jane said in her prepared remarks, we're pleased with the progress that we're making around the transformation work, and there are a number of aspects of that that are at their target state, which is a, which I think is a very, very positive sign. I think I've said before that we've spent, last year, we spent about $3 billion investing in the transformation work, and that I expected that we'd have a meaningful increase in that spend in 2025. We are seeing that increase.\nI do expect that as we go into 2026 and beyond, as programs are completed, validated, proven to be sustainable, and vetted by the regulators, we will start to see that spend come down in 2026 and beyond. We'll also start to see some of the benefits from those investments help to reduce our underlying operating cost. The final point I'd make is that, you know, we're not just looking at these investment dollars without teasing out opportunities to extract efficiencies from them. What I mean by that is when we talk about applying AI tools to the work that we do on a day-to-day basis, that includes the work that we have to do in executing against our transformation and remediating the consent order concerns.\nThere too our efficiencies in how we go about doing that again, all of which will help to drive down cost in 2026 and beyond.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nI just re-emphasize you don't need to wait for a consent order to be lifted to bring the expense down. You get the work done, you go into sustainability, you hand the work over to the regulators, and then they make a determination. Don't just think this only happens when orders are lifted.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Our next question will come from Ibrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla Bank of America Securities)\n\nHead Managing Director\n\nHey, good morning.\nI guess. Just wanted to follow up, Mark, on the capital question. Just talk to us as we think about and appreciate what you just said. When we think about the binding constraint from standardized to advanced, how we.\nShould think about it and other actions.\nWe saw in SRT trade that Citi, I think, executed in June. Just what are the avenues to optimize the capital stack so that advance doesn't become a binding constraint for Citi?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nAny perspective would be helpful there. Thanks. Yeah, I think the first thing I'd say is that, you know, today our standardized CET1 is our binding constraint. The second thing I'd point to is that you've seen us be very disciplined over the past couple years at managing our risk-weighted assets on a standardized basis and optimizing the use of them, particularly in areas like Markets, to ensure that we're getting the best return for the deployment of those risk-weighted assets. And that is also true for how we think about advanced. As the gap between the two narrows, we're equally focused on how do we ensure that we're, that we're using risk-weighted assets on both a standardized and advanced basis as efficiently as we can. And so we're mindful of how tight they're running.\nStandardized is still the binding constraint, but as we look at the businesses and the activities that we do, we're making sure that we drive for that greater efficiency from those two metrics. But there are multiple reasons why there's a difference between standardized and advanced RWA. They have to do with how each framework treats certain credit portfolios, whether it be consumer or wholesale. Standardized tends to be more punitive to the mortgage book. Advanced is more punitive to international wholesale exposures. And so we're mindful of those things as we, as we drive towards kind of the efficient use. But we're also mindful that the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. And you know, who knows, Advanced under Basel III is supposed to be down a path of retirement.\nWe want to be thoughtful about how we manage the two metrics so that we aren't compromising the strategy for a metric that may be temporary. Again, pleased with the tone in D.C. in terms of looking at things holistically and looking forward to some speedy advancement as it relates to the outcome of their reviews.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nHelpful. I guess I think Jane alluded to this on stablecoins. There is a lot of focus on how stablecoins could be used for Treasury management, global liquidity management. If we could double click on that. In terms of how you're already using, how you're already using these internally, and do you view disruption risk to services revenues tied to increased adoption of stablecoins? Thank you.\nLook, digital assets are the next evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing, and liquidity. I view it just as we were seeing a change with fintech a few years ago.\nUltimately what we care about is what our clients want and how do we meet that need? What our client wants is multi asset, multi bank cross border, always on solutions, provide in a safe and sound manner with as many of the complexities solved for them like compliance, accounting, reporting, etc.\nThat's what we do. We are the global leader at enabling clients to move money. Cross-border and digital asset solutions complement our existing product suite. So we're well advanced in developing our digital asset capabilities. You've heard me talk a lot about Citi Token Services and a slew of other innovations.\nWhat they do is they let us modernize our own business where needed. They grow new revenue streams for us and also allow us to acquire new clients.\nSo when I look at the stablecoin side, so four main areas that we're exploring, reserve management for stablecoins, the on and off ramps from cash and coin backwards and forwards. We are looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin, but probably most importantly is the tokenized deposit space where we're very active, and then also providing custodial solutions for crypto assets. So this is, this is a good opportunity for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, just one specific question on the transformation costs. What were they for the second quarter? I'm just trying to get a run rate and where those go to. Yes, I didn't, I haven't broken them out here for the second quarter, Mike. What I will say is what I said already, which was we had $3 billion last year. We're increasing that meaningfully in the year and we obviously saw some of that increase play through the first and second quarter and expect to see a bit more of it in the third and fourth before trending down in 2026.\nOkay. The stranded cost, you said you have just $1.2 billion left of those?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, the proxy, if you look at the all other page in the bottom right-hand side, it gives you a little bit of a proxy for that. The Q2 expenses, look at closed or signed markets, about $100 million. The wind-down sale and others, about $200 million. So call it $300 million a quarter that we have that we're continuing to push and drive out of the place. It's probably a little bit once a Banamex or Mexico deal is signed. But the good proxy is about $300 million that we're still working to drive out. All right. Then separately, maybe this is for Jane.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nI guess what I'm thinking, not the consent order, but when the amended portion of the amended consent order comes off, and I know you can't answer that directly, but what is it you're trying to show to regulators to help?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nShow them that the amended portion of the consent order no longer needs to be there? I mean, when you look at the substance, the org simplification is done, the exits are mostly done. The modernization you've made progress in the two decades since stuff didn't happen, the management restructuring done to five lines of business. And you said the data plan's on track, whereas I guess it wasn't necessarily on track before. So what does it take to get that amended portion taken off or what are you trying to show regulators?\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nWell, I would say that we're focused on making sure that we can close the consent orders, not just the amended portion. The amended portions is what it says. It's a resource review plan to make sure that we've got the resources that are required for the progress that we're making and for the completion of the work. And I would just take the opportunity, Mike, just to reinforce that. I feel very good about the progress we've made in our trajectory. We are now at or mostly at Citi's target state for the majority of the programs. You can see that in the scorecard. We laid out important areas like end to end risk management, lifecycle compliance, and risk management. We've got the new forecasting engine for the RESO requirements. Once you're in the target state, you then have to ensure the programs run sustainably.\nThey deliver the desired reduction. That takes a bit of time before we then hand them over to the regulatory review process.\nOn data.\nWe're early in the remediation work, following the step back we took last year. But I'm very pleased with the progress this year. We're seeing good momentum, and I'm very excited about the work we're doing, enhancing the controls, driving a lot of automation, and AI is definitely starting to help us remediate it. So essentially they'll want to see each of the different programs in target state delivering what they're meant to be delivering.\nAnd then they would move to their closure process. But we're pleased with the risk reduction. We're pleased with where we're headed. So it's all going the right way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much. Just one question on Banamex, Mark. I think you mentioned just now when Banamex is signed. Maybe we could get an update as to where things stand there?\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nYeah, look, there's nothing new to update you on. We continue to be on track with the preparation for the IPO.\nThe team is focused on finalizing the audit financial statements for later this quarter. You can imagine there's a lot of regulatory filings to be done.\nOur goal is to do everything in our control to be in a position to IPO by the year end. Obviously, the timing there depends on market conditions and regulatory approvals, which could well take us into 2026. As I talked about, and the other very important piece, we're focused on improving Banamex's business performance, and I'm pleased that we're capturing share. We're outpacing growth in the market. The consumer businesses are growing at double digits. All of this is headed in a good way. There's.\nNothing to update you on there.\nIt's.\nWe're focused on what we told you we would do, and is there a bogey with regard to, like, what a market is open means.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWith regard to.\nNo, no, I mean no different to any other IPO. No, no, no bogey there.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nWe obviously have a valuable asset and maximize shareholder value as we think about exiting it, but there's no specific bogey to it.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nYeah, we'll do this at the right time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Wanted to ask about credit cards. You noticed some nice improvement in the credit quality, trends in cards, and a better outlook for second half losses. Could you drill down a little bit, Mark? What you saw in terms of delinquencies and roll rates in the second quarter, and whether that improvement you're talking about, is that driven by macro factors or some seasoning factors in your portfolio?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, sure. Good morning, John. Look.\nI think when you look at the performance in the quarter, we're very pleased, first of all, with USPB performance in aggregate. Very pleased. With Branded Cards, you see good purchase or spend volume tick up there. Importantly, you're seeing good average interest-earning balance growth there as well. Payment rates are kind of in line with expectations, as are the loss rates that you can see kind of fleshed out a little bit more on page 21 of the deck. In fact, you see those kind of loss rates kind of ticking down a little bit quarter to quarter, and you see the 90 days past due that we show ticking down as well. What I'd highlight is that is largely consistent with kind of pre-Covid seasonality.\nIn terms of that delinquency behavior, that gives us some confidence on where losses are likely to trend, all things being equal. When we look at kind of the nature of the spend, it's in line with kind of where we would expect. We are seeing continued increase in spend, but it tends to be towards the more affluent customers, and you know, we skew towards the higher FICO score. It's in essentials. There is some in dining and entertainment, less in travel. A discerning consumer, I think, in good health given the uncertainty in the current environment. We are watching things in addition to delinquencies and NCLs. We're looking at, you know, obviously the impact of tariffs, the path of interest rates, consumer spending and how that's evolving, labor markets, et cetera.\nNet net is kind of what I alluded to earlier, which is good trends in some of these key indicators, giving us confidence on the NCL guidance range.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, thanks. Just to follow up on expenses, appreciate the earlier comments on the cost trends and opportunities as you look into next year. Mark, are you still thinking about that kind of sub $52.6 billion as a goal for next year, and is that also a level we should view as a waypoint with further opportunities?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi",
    "content2": "Yeah, look, I still think of that as the target for next year. As I've said before, I would take a step back for a second and just, you know, I'm focused. We're focused on, you know, the 10%-11%, and then improving our returns beyond that. Right. The expenses are obviously a key component to that. I highlight that because what you see in the half and in the quarter is very strong momentum on the top line.\nWhen Jane talked about 2026 and beyond, she talked about continued momentum on that top line. I would just highlight that we're not going to miss an opportunity for that to be sustainable by not investing in the franchise. Right. As we get into 2026, you know, if there are opportunities for us to be investing to drive more sustainable growth on the top line, capture more synergies across these businesses, we're going to be doing that, and we're doing that, by the way, in 2025 too, and funding a lot of it out of the productivity savings that we're able to generate. You're seeing that in talent. We're bringing in wealth talent, we're bringing in in banking. Those investments are what has allowed for us to really drive this 8% you saw in the quarter, and the 5% you see year to date.\nLong winded way of saying yes, that's the target as I think about 2026. I'm really trying to make sure we get good momentum out of our returns, and that, as Jane says, is something that continues to improve even as we come out at 26.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThanks. That's a good segue to a question I had on the progress you made in investment banking and markets. The couple things I heard over the last couple quarters, but definitely today, are big growth in prime broker services, investments in leveraged finance, progress in converts. All that is good use of balance sheet. They do use balance sheet. I'm cool with that. I guess I'm more asking on the go forward basis.\nAre there key hires that go along with that and client wins that we don't get details on? Is there an opportunity to add good return on RWA balance sheet commitment further? I think there were some pulling back over the last couple of years as you needed to, and now I hear that being let out. I feel like sometimes that might be, I don't want to call easy, but easier to drive some share gains by letting out a little bit more rope. Just looking to get color on that. Thanks.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nYeah, thanks, Glenn. Look, we believe there is very good opportunity to add in a number of areas.\nGood returning RWA and further balance sheet commitments. I won't go through the answer I gave on the first question because I was running through a lot of different areas, because there's a multitude of it.\nWe're being, I think, biz has put real discipline into how we look at allocating balance sheet. All of our business heads get together, and they decide collectively, for example, on the deployment of the corporate loan book and where, if we're leaning in on lending, making sure we get the full share of wallet, not just hitting return target from it. That's been an area that's got good discipline. Prime's got a lot of upside and a lot more way to go in terms of adding the volumes onto the platform that we've got that scaled. I look in the private capital space in the financing business, another area with high marginal returns, some of the mortgage book, not a huge growth area for us, but another one that's got good opportunity. We've got to love our proprietary car business.\nThere's a multitude of different places that we see that we expect to be deploying capital with high returns whilst continuing the discipline we've got, which is also taking capital away from some of the areas that have been either at low returns or that are commoditizing. I'm very proud of the team, they've done an excellent job on that. We'll continue doing more of the same.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThat's great. One more follow up within services. You talked about lower loan spreads, but in general I think everybody's got a lot more capital than they.\nThanks to earnings and drag. Just more a broad question across all the businesses. What are you expecting in terms of loan yields with all this excess capital and what I would call limited demand still?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, look, we are seeing continued loan growth across the portfolio. We've seen it, as you mentioned, in services, in trade loans, and those are really on the heels of our clients looking at different trading corridors and wanting to bring on additional suppliers in preparation for what could be on the other side of trade policy. That was good loan growth in the quarter at, I would say, at good yields, although there is some spread compression there. The USPB card portfolio had good loan growth again with average interest earning balances. That's contributing to, you know, improved returns, and so, you know, feel good about that.\nOur markets business, particularly in spreads, we expect to see continued growth, particularly in private credit, and that's largely driven by asset-backed financing and a bit of commercial real estate. We're seeing it, you know, the growth we expect to see and are seeing it kind of across many of those segments, you know, as rates continue to, as rates come down, that'll obviously, you know, impact the, you know, the funding cost of those assets. We feel good about the yields that we're, we're getting on them, as you know.\nWe are kind of looking at the investments that we have in corporate, and as those mature, we're redeploying those into higher yielding assets, whether they be loans or frankly even you get a better yield on some of the investments in cash. Those are a number of the drivers that we have in place that are contributing to NIM improvement as we manage through the environment that we're in.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, how are you? Good afternoon. First question, just Mark, you talked about the good trends on the credit losses side and you talked about, you know, at the last conference having a few hundred million a build and that ended up being $600 million plus. Given that you're one of the best reserve banks already, was that just more of a catch up related to the kind of post 2 April? Because you had mentioned before that cost of credit could be one of the things that could inhibit a path to 10. I just want to understand how caught up are we now and how are you thinking about that as we look ahead?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThanks. Sure. Look, I break it down in a couple of ways. One, I do feel very good about our reserve levels. $23.7 billion, 2.7% reserve to loan ratio.\nWhen we look at the cost of credit in the quarter, we're looking at two point, we have $2.9 billion that we booked in the quarter, total cost of credit. When you break that down, you know, the NCLs is the largest part of that, and the NCLs, you know, were about $2.2 billion in the quarter. That's largely related to the cards portfolios that we have. Those loss rates, as I mentioned, are inside of the range, which is a good thing. We have an ACL build that's about $600 million. None of the build, none of the net build in the quarter is associated with the cards or consumer portfolio. The $600 million can be broken down into two buckets largely. One is the transfer risk in Russia.\nThink about this as being, you know, we still have reduced operations in Russia. We still have dividends that come in that we have on behalf of our clients. We're unable to pay those dividends out given US law, and as such, we have to hold a reserve around those dividends that we have on behalf of our clients, so as our role as custodian. About half of what we built in the quarter was largely associated with having to establish the reserve for the unremittable dividends that we have there. The other half is tied to the corporate portfolio changes.\nThere you can see both in Markets where we had an increase in loans and financing and securitization, as well as in Banking where we saw quarter-over-quarter increase in volume, as well as some idiosyncratic names in both, were the drivers of the other portion of the ACL build. Consumer ACL flat, billed largely on the corporate side related to those two drivers. Take a step back, continue to feel very good about health of the consumer at this stage, reserve levels that we have, and about the quality of our corporate book that we also have in the aggregate reserve level.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, got it. Just second question, just in the TTS business, we talked about like Citi sitting in the middle of all the activity. Smaller line, but the fees in Treasury and Trade were a little softer. I'm just wondering, just now that we know more about things that we're seeing around the world, like any changes to just client engagement, potentially for the better, or if not for the worse, and just how it feels in terms of like global activity that flows through that business. Thanks.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nYeah, we've been very proactively helping clients navigate the macro and the geopolitical uncertainty. That's what's been driving the strong growth this quarter.\nCross-border transaction value up 9% year-over-year, U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6%. The only area that had been a little softer on that front was the commercial card just being flat year-over-year, and that was due to lower government spend and a little bit of the macro uncertainty. On the fee front, I think we're feeling pretty good about this one. If I look at, for example, the demand for trade loans, we onboarded almost 2,000 new suppliers this past quarter. We grew new wins by 24% year-over-year, as corporates have been building up inventory to limit unforeseen disruptions. We've also been very active in the different digital asset innovations I was talking about earlier.\nIt's been busy. The operating deposit growth, I don't want to sniff at that either because that drove some strong deposit levels. Average deposits are up 7% year-over-year as clients were building up cash buffers and keeping more working capital on hand. Kind of firing, as I say, on all cylinders here as well as elsewhere given the environment. Mark, anything you'd add?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThe only thing I'd add, Ken, I appreciate the comment in terms of or the question I should say, if you look at page 10, one of the things I tried to highlight is that the non-interest revenue includes the revenue sharing that occurs. The total fee revenue, which we break out on the left-hand side, was actually up 6%. I know services is obviously both TTS and Securities Services, but I can tell you that that up 6% includes fee momentum on the TTS side as well as Securities Services. You know, don't be misled by the down 1% here or even what's in the supplement. The underlying fee growth is aligned with the strength we're seeing in those key performance indicators that Jay mentioned earlier.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Christopher McGratty with KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nOh great, thanks for the question.\nJust going back to the buyback comment for a minute if I could, the at least $4 billion.\nHow would you attribute that? Is that more Citi specific given the momentum you're expressing on the call today, or really greater clarity on the regulatory environment?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nWell look, I mean I am very, I feel very good about the performance that we have as a firm in the quarter. In the half, you can see just how much net income we generate in the quarter on slide 9 on the left hand side. I feel good about the prospect for continuing to generate earnings momentum in the balance of the year. That gives us confidence around.\nThe buyback levels that we have, both in the third quarter that I referenced, but also in the $20 billion share repurchase program that we talked about earlier in the year. Our performance is certainly a factor, and an important factor, in our confidence on the buybacks. Now, obviously, the direction and tone, as I've said a couple of times, on what we're hearing around a holistic view and look at capital is important for us and important for the industry. As I mentioned earlier, the direction that the SCB is going will likely afford us some flexibility. This is the right path for us in terms of as many buybacks or as much in buybacks as we can do early in the year, given where we're trading. We feel very good about doing that.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nI second that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nMy follow up, the 10-11 return on equity for next year, presumably that had some degree of deregulatory benefit in there is what we know today versus maybe six months ago. Does that give you, I guess, greater confidence that either the level or the timing might be sooner or better than initial expectations?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThanks. The timing for. Sorry.\nJust the level of ROE or the timing to get to the 10-11. Thanks.\nLook, I think you've heard us talk about the 10 to 11 for some time now, and that really has been rooted in what we knew then, frankly, in terms of the strength of the franchise and recognizing that there was uncertainty around how capital levels would evolve. I can't, I don't think the takeaway is that the 10-11 is supported by known changes in the capital regime. I think it is, like I said, more aligned with, you know, where we, the strength we see in the underlying franchise.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Hi.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nHey, Gerald.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJane, you talked about the trends in NII in wealth management, the organic growth over the last 12 months, the high single digits. There was weakness in the second quarter market conditions as you pointed out. Did you see it toward the end of the quarter as the markets came back? Were there different flow characteristics, say in the month of June versus April? I know July is only two weeks old, but any color on it in the first couple of weeks?\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nYeah, we saw positive momentum in May and June as clients became more proactive. That underlay the comment I made that as the markets have been recovering and some of the initial surprise at everything that was happening, clients settled down. I think they're still being conservative. There's still a sense of let's wait and see, but will be poised to support them when they're ready to be active.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. Mark, maybe you can remind us when you guys allocate your capital, the tangible common equity by segment, you break it out first. I think it was slide 23. Markets is at $50.4 billion versus $54 billion a year ago. Can you share with us again why you guys have been able to lower that allocation?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, again, this is on the heels of some very good work in Markets in terms of optimizing use of risk-weighted assets and generating higher revenue for use of balance sheet. That obviously contributed to more steady, solid performance in both earnings, as well as returns that we've seen. As we look at this once a year in terms of how we disclose it, there was certainly an opportunity there to, in light of their contribution to stress losses, bring down what we allocated to the Markets business.\nI would highlight that if you look across that page, I think it's page 19 in the deck, you actually see that most of the businesses had a reduction in allocated TCE.\nOn the heels of improved equity performance that we saw coming out of 2024. That's the approach that we take. Obviously, the ideal scenario is that we are bringing down the capital requirements in aggregate at the firm level through returning that to shareholders, or ensuring that we're earning higher returns on it. The businesses have been performing well, and it has shown up in their allocated TCE while supporting continued growth that they expect in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nHi, just wanted to ask on expenses back half of the year, the full year guide implies costs coming down. Obviously you had quite high severance this quarter. Just want to get a sense of what you're assuming for kind of severance the rest of the year. I think you said some of the.\nKind of transformation costs are going up. Any other puts and takes to flag?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, I think I'd, in terms of your question on stranded costs, I think I'd given guidance that we had roughly $600 million or so in our forecast for the full year of 2025.\nWhen I look at where we are through the second quarter, probably at 500 of that 600. You can envision in the second half a meaningful reduction in the amount of severance that we're assuming in the balance of the year. As you would imagine, that severance.\nIs in place for employees that are leaving. We would also see the benefit from reduction in compensation associated with that start to play in the back of the year as well. Obviously, I mentioned earlier stranded cost, productivity, those are all other drivers that contribute to the downward trend. Obviously, revenue to the extent that this year-over-year revenue growth, we'd expect it to be volume and revenue related expenses associated with that. Any transformation or other hiring that we do would be the offset. The downward trajectory, those are the drivers that get us to the full year estimate that we've been talking about at $53.4.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Just in the severance, I think it had a placeholder for a few hundred million next year, but are.\nYou kind of getting after it.\nLittle bit sooner than you thought, and it might be lost or still have a placeholder for a few hundred million next year as of now?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, I'm not changing my guidance on next year at this point, but we feel good about the path we're on for the balance of 2025, and feel good about that 10 to 11 as we go into next year. We'll deal with kind of where there's opportunity to do something different as we kind of get into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Steven Alexopoulos with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nSenior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi everybody. This is actually for Jane. Jane, I want to go back to your response to Ibrahim's earlier question. Stablecoins were a good opportunity for Citi. I don't know if you caught NBC yesterday. Circle CEO was on, he made the comment that no one sends an email. Cross Border. Right. Implies that the stablecoin companies are coming after Cross Border. The questions are how much of the total company's revenue is Cross Border, and do you have an appetite to proactively disrupt yourself in a way to get ahead of these new entrants coming into the business?\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nOh, I can't wait to answer this question. If you keep in mind, right now stablecoin, about 88% of all stablecoin transactions are used to settle crypto trades. Only 6% is payments. In a traditional offering, if you are moving from cash to stablecoin and back to cash right now, you're incurring as much as a 7% transaction cost. I mean, that's prohibitive. This is where Citi Token Services is so exciting because it enables a client to move from physical fiat to the digital and back again without incurring that transaction cost. A client can move cash across their regional and global hubs, say from New York to Hong Kong and the UK and back again on us instantaneously, 24/7, cross border.\nWe also absorb all of the complexities that you'd have to do if you're working with stablecoin and moving back to fiat, such as the accounting, the AML, you know, et cetera, et cetera. Truly, as I mentioned, we've been already moving billions in transaction volume this year on Citi Token Services. Ours is the superior offering here, particularly for our corporate clients. If anything, what's holding us back at the moment is our clients' readiness to operate in this world because we're ready, we're doing it, and we're going to keep on innovating. We're just going to keep building these capabilities out into the payments, financing, liquidity, and other spaces. We'll do it in a safe and sound manner because trust is also important.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nSenior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nI appreciate that color for my follow up. I fully get the value of the token to your clients. I asked Jannie this question this morning on the JPMorgan call. When I think about the advantage you have, you have the last mile relationship, so you're in the pole position right now. When we think about the value of what, say, Circle Payment Network does, you know, over time, they need to build a network. You already have one, they need to build one, but they'll connect everybody that uses different banks. If you got together with Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and others, you could very quickly create a network that could almost be impenetrable by these newer entrants. This is the perplexing thing to me.\nWhat is holding the banks up today from joining together the same way you did with Zelle? You'll block off these new entrants entirely because to me, that's what needs to happen for all the benefits you talked about to stay in your ecosystem.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThis is one of the reasons we really welcome the administration's willingness to allow banks to participate in the digital asset space more easily. This is where the Genius Act is also something that we're enthusiastic about, particularly because it gives a level playing field as well. Up until now, it has been hard for us to participate.\nIn a level playing field, as you talked about, I go back to, I think, your point, but also the point I made earlier. What do clients want? They want multi-asset, multi-bank, cross-border, always-on solutions in payments, financing, and liquidity. We shall do that, and we shall do that in a safe and sound manner. There'll be areas we'll cooperate with other banks. To do what I just said, we don't need another bank. We're the global leader in this, and we'll absorb all of those complexities of compliance, reporting, accounting, AML, for the client. To your point, I think we have the killer app here.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, HSBC\n\nAll right, thanks for squeezing me in. Just one question for me. Wanted to ask about USPB. Good momentum there. The 11% ROTCE direction of travel is positive there, but it's still, you know, pretty low. Given the mix of businesses that you're in, largely cards, you would think that the ROTCE should be higher. Can you just remind me what your goal is there, how quickly you can get there, and what is still an impediment to you delivering that kind of return? Do you still have transformation? Do you have transformation costs in there? Is the retail banking business a drag? What's sort of making you under earned still in this business?\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nOur goal is mid teens, then high teens on the ROTCE target for this business.\nWe are very committed to both the cards business as well as the retail bank. I'll talk a little bit about the retail bank quickly in a minute as well. We have a path to high returns from revenue in terms of also improving expenses. As you say, we have elevated expenses because of the transformation.\nWe've also got the path on capital there.\nI feel very good about the strategy in cards. We're a prime credit-led card issuer. We've got a very diverse portfolio, a sizable proprietary portfolio that we're growing, and we've got some real marquee slate of partner clients.\nWe will continue growing our revenue by expanding and refreshing the product suite. You've just seen what we've announced. We've also invested a lot in the digital capabilities, incentivizing cardholders to do more, and we've had 11 quarters now. I think it is a positive operating leverage. I think you're going to see us keep delivering about that in an improved credit environment we hope, and that's what we're seeing going forward. The other area is we're investing a lot in AI, and that is going to deliver efficiency as well as service benefits. I'm pretty excited about what we see there, and I don't want to forget the retail bank strategy because it is the front door to Citi in the state.\nWhile we've only got 650 branches, our six core markets have 1/3 of the high net worth households in the states. It makes the retail bank a very important feeder for wealth. We have the highest deposits per branch as well, and this is not just a low-cost funding option for us.\nI'm really positive to have seen the good growth on the retail bank there. I think you just see us steadily moving forward towards that target. Next year we've got the benefit of the Barclays portfolio coming on board as well.\nI'm nicely, I think you can tell, nicely confident about the path we're on, the direction of travel, and meeting those returns.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, HSBC\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you everyone for joining us. Please reach out if you have any follow up questions. Thanks everyone. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Citi's second quarter 2025 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Sam."

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you,\nOperator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our first quarrter 2025 earnings call. I'm joined today by our Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser and our Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings material as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nThank you Jen. A very good morning to everyone. First I'm going to discuss our first quarter results and then talk about the environment we're operating in and how we are positioning the bank for it.\nThis morning we reported net income of $4.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.96 with an ROTCE of 9.1%.\nOverall, it was a strong quarter marked by continued momentum in each of our five businesses. We maintained a disciplined approach to our expenses, which declined by 5% year over year. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage for each of our five lines of business and the fourth consecutive quarter for the firm overall.\nWe.\nIncreased both our return on tangible common equity in each business and our return of capital to our shareholders. This quarter is a further proof point of how the consistent execution of our strategy is improving our performance.\nServices recorded its highest first quarter revenue in a decade. TTS continues to demonstrate momentum in the key underlying drivers across US Dollar Clearing and cross-border activity. Security Services gained share and grew its assets under custody and administration to $26 trillion. Markets had a good quarter with revenue up 12%. The three most significant fixed income businesses, Rates, Spread Products, and FX, each contributed to an overall 8% increase over last year. In a good macro quarter for equities, we were up 23%. As we continued with our long-term strategy to augment our high derivatives share with a larger prime business, banking was up 12%. As we continue to gain share in Investment Banking across most industry sectors, most notably M&A, revenue nearly doubled.\nWe're seeing the benefits of our talent investments as you can see by the leading role we played in some of the year's biggest transactions, such as advising Altair on the Siemens acquisition and on the recently announced Intra-Cellular transaction by J&J. Turning to wealth, all three businesses contributed to overall growth of 24%, and fee revenue drove non-interest revenue growth of 16%. We remain focused on capturing assets our clients have off us, as demonstrated by the roughly 11% organic growth in client investment assets. Andy and his new team are making excellent progress executing our strategy with the business delivering record revenue this quarter and improved efficiency and returns. USPB was up 2%, driven mainly by increased loan balances and spending in Branded Cards.\nThe high credit quality of our Card portfolio reflects the focus we've put on prime consumers, and our portfolio continued to perform in line with our expectations. Overall, USPB's return increased to nearly 13%.\nDuring the quarter. We returned $2.8 billion in capital to our shareholders, including $1.75 billion of buybacks as part of our $20 billion plan, which is about $250 million more than we had originally guided. That's our highest quarterly amount since 2022 and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.4% and our tangible book value per share crossed $90.\nTurning to our strategic priorities, our transformation investments continue to modernize our infrastructure, simplify our processes, and reduce manual touch points. During the quarter, we retired legacy applications and automated reconciliations, to name but a few accomplishments.\nWe are also integrating AI directly into our business operations to improve the client experience. The latest example is Agent Assist, our first generative AI tool for customer service in US Personal Banking. It is designed to help our team resolve inquiries faster and is now being piloted in credit Cards.\nFrom quarter to quarter. We are building on our track record of progress, and I am confident in our ability to continue delivering despite the uncertainty of the moment. In terms of the macro environment, I am not going to try to predict the unpredictable. While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We know that prolonged uncertainty generally hurts confidence. The changes underway globally will go beyond trade and tariffs. In the US, for example, regulation and tax policy are all likely to look different in a year's time, and these changes will not only have economic impact, but geopolitical and cultural ones as well.\nWe appreciate the administration taking a fresh look at regulations across all industries to unlock growth. We welcome the changes being discussed in our own industry to place more focus on material financial risks and to make it easier for banks to contribute to economic growth and to improve client service. When all is said and done and these longstanding trade imbalances, and other structural shifts are behind us, the US will still be the world's leading economy and the dollar will remain the reserve currency. The deep knowledge and breadth of capabilities that we have from decades on the ground in so many local markets are real points of distinction when serving our clients. From reconfiguring their supply chain to addressing their hedging and funding approaches, to advising on their strategic agendas.\nI am very confident that we have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix that will perform in a wide variety of macro scenarios and is differentiating in times like these. With capital strength, plentiful liquidity, and strong reserves, we can navigate through any environment from a position of strength in periods of stress. We have shown that we are a port during the storm for our clients, the global markets, and the economy, and this time is no different, we are ready to lean in. As I look forward to the rest of the year we shall remain disciplined about returning capital and managing our expenses while protecting necessary investments in our businesses as well as our transformation. We shall not allow the uncertainty to distract us from executing our strategy and improving our returns.\nNow over to Mark and then we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the performance of our businesses in greater detail.\nOn slide six, we show financial results for the full firm. This quarter, we reported net income of $4.1 billion, EPS of $1.96, and an ROTCE of 9.1% on $21.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our five businesses. Total revenues were up 3%, driven by growth in each of our businesses, largely offset by a decline in All Other. Net interest income excluding Markets was up 2%, driven by USPB, Wealth, and Services, largely offset by declines in All Other and Banking. Non-interest revenues excluding Markets were down 6%, as better results in Banking and Wealth were more than offset by declines in All Other, USPB, and Services, and total Markets revenues were up 12%. Expenses of $13.4 billion were down 5%.\nCost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in Cards as well as a firm-wide net ACL build reflecting the uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. Before I move on, I would like to note that certain Card transaction processing fees paid primarily to networks were previously presented in operating expenses and are now presented as a contra revenue and non-interest revenue, primarily impacting USPB. This change does not impact net income, and prior periods have been aligned. We provided additional detail in the appendix of the presentation on slide 22.\nOn slide seven we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. As we've said in the past, we are very focused on bringing down our expense base. At the same time, the transformation remains our number one priority and we will continue to make the investments needed specifically as it relates to data and regulatory reporting. Having said that, the drivers of our expense reduction going forward remain consistent with those that we have referenced in the past. Savings related to stranded cost reduction, productivity from our prior investments, and our organizational simplification, all of which allow us to self fund our investments in transformation. As we look at this quarter, expenses declined by 5%, which included a favorable FX impact.\nThe decline was driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge, and lower compensation, partially offset by increases in technology and communication professional fees related to transformation as well as advertising and marketing. Looking at the rest of the year, we remain on track to meet our full year expense target.\nOn slide 8 we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. As I mentioned, the firm's cost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in Cards, as well as a firm-wide net ACL build. The ACL build reflects uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, including a further skew to the downside scenario. In our CECL framework, our reserves now incorporate an eight-quarter weighted average unemployment rate of 5.1%, which includes a downside scenario average unemployment rate of 6.7%. Largely offsetting this build was a release related to lower balances in our Card portfolios. At the end of the quarter, we had $22.8 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loans ratio of 2.7%.\nNow turning to consumer credit on the left-hand side of the page, approximately 85% of our Card portfolios are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. NCL rates increased sequentially in both Card portfolios, consistent with historical seasonal patterns, and we continue to see stabilization in delinquency rates across both portfolios, and our reserve-to-funded loan ratio in our Card portfolio is 8.2%, and corporate non-accrual loans remain low, reflecting the investment-grade nature of our portfolio. Based on the quality and mix of our portfolio, we believe we are well reserved, but as always, we continue to monitor the evolving macroeconomic outlook.\nTurning to Slide nine where I will speak to sequential variances, Citi's $2.6 trillion balance sheet increased 9%, driven by growth in trading related assets which is typical given the seasonal increase in markets activity. We also built out our cash position as we let investment securities roll off and opportunistically issued long-term debt. Loans increased 1% driven by Services and Markets, largely offset by lower balances in Cards. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types and increased 2% primarily driven by Services. We reported 117% average LCR and maintained $960 billion of available liquidity resources. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, down approximately 20 basis points as net income was more than offset by capital distributions.\nRWA growth and higher DTA deduction. We continue to feel very good about the strength and quality of our balance sheet, and our robust capital and liquidity position us well to support our clients in a range of economic environments. Turning to the businesses on slide 10, we show the results for Services in first quarter. Services revenues were up 3% driven by growth in TTS. NII increased 5% driven by higher deposit spreads as well as an increase in deposits and loan balances. NIR declined 4% driven by the absence of certain episodic fees and Security Services as well as higher revenue share and the impact of FX across both TTS and Security Services. That said, we continue to see strength in underlying fee drivers across the business,\nas you can see on the bottom right hand side of the page. Expenses declined 3% largely driven by lower deposit insurance costs, severance, and legal expenses. Average loans increased 6% driven by continued demand for Export Agency Finance, as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 2% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $1.6 billion, and continued to deliver a high ROTCE of 26.2%.\nOn slide 11, we show the results for Markets in Q1. Markets revenues were up 12% driven by growth across both fixed income and equity. Fixed income revenues increased 8% with Rates and Currencies up 9%, reflecting increased client activity and monetization, and Spread Products and other fixed income up 7%, driven by higher client activity and loan growth. Equities revenues increased 23% primarily driven by equity derivatives on increased market volatility and higher client activity, and momentum in Prime Services, with prime balances up approximately 16%. Expenses increased 2% driven by higher volume and other revenue-related expenses. Cost of credit was $201 million primarily related to Spread Products driven by net credit losses, and a net ACL build.\nAverage loans increased 7%, driven by financing activity, and spread product. Markets generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.8 billion and an ROTCE of 14.3%.\nOn slide 12, we show the results for Banking in first quarter. Banking revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in Investment Banking as well as the impact of mark-to-market on loan hedges, partially offset by a decline in Corporate Lending. Investment Banking fees increased 14%, with growth in M&A partially offset by declines in DCM and ECM. M&A was up 84% as we gained share overall and across numerous sectors. ECM was down 3% compared to a near record first quarter last year, and DCM was down 26% amid a pullback in the wallet for follow-ons and convertible Corporate Lending. Revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges declined 1% as increases in revenue share were more than offset by the combined impact of lower loan balances and higher recoveries in the prior year.\nExpenses declined 12% largely driven by lower compensation as we see the benefit of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $214 million consisting of an ACL build of $180 million driven by changes in the macroeconomic outlook and net credit losses. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $543 million and an ROTCE of 10.7%.\nOn slide 13 we show the results for Wealth in first quarter. Wealth revenues were up 24% with growth across Citigold, the Private Bank, and Wealth at Work. NII increased 30% driven by higher deposit spreads partially offset by lower deposit balances, and NIR increased 16% primarily driven by growth in investment fee revenues as we grew client investment assets by 16%. This includes net new investment assets of $16.5 billion in the quarter and over $56 billion in the last 12 months representing approximately 11% organic growth. Expenses were roughly flat as the benefits of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base, as well as lower technology expenses, were offset by higher revenue-related expenses and severance.\nEnd of period client balances increased 7% driven by higher net new investment asset flows and market valuation. Average loans declined 2% as we continue to be strategic in deploying the balance sheet to support growth in client investment assets. Average deposits also declined 2% driven by a shift in deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform and other operating outflow, largely offset by client transfers from USPB, reflecting our ability to support clients as their wealth and investment needs evolve. Wealth had a pretax margin of 17% and generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $284 million and an ROTCE of 9.4%.\nOn slide 14 we show the results for US Personal Banking. In the first quarter US Personal Banking revenues were up 2% driven by growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, largely offset by a decline in Retail Services. Branded Cards revenues increased 9% with interest earning balance growth of 8%, and we continue to see spend growth which was up 3%. Retail Banking revenues increased 17% driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads, and in Retail Services revenues declined 11% primarily driven by higher partner payment accruals. Expenses were roughly flat due to continued productivity savings offset by higher advertising and marketing, as well as legal expenses. Cost of credit was $1.8 billion, consisting of net credit losses partially offset by a net ACL release of $172 million.\nThis included a build related to changes in the portfolio composition and macroeconomic outlook, which was more than offset by a release due to lower Card balances largely in Retail Services. Notwithstanding this release, our Cards' reserve to funded loan ratio increased to 8.2% from 7.9% last quarter. Average deposits declined 11% driven by client transfers to Wealth that I just mentioned. USPB generated positive operating leverage for the 10th consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $745 million and an ROTCE of 12.9%.\nOn slide 15, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate, Other, and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues declined 39% with declines across both Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises. Corporate Other was largely driven by lower NII as well as the impact of mark-to-market valuation changes on certain investments on non-NIR. Legacy Franchises was driven by the impact of Mexican peso depreciation, expiration of TSAs in our closed/exit markets, and continued reduction from our wind-down markets. Expenses declined 17%, driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge, reduction from exit markets in wind-down, and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation. Cost of credit was $359 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $256 million driven by consumer loans in Mexico.\nOn Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2025 outlook, which we've adjusted for the impact of the Card transaction processing fee presentation change that I mentioned earlier but is otherwise unchanged. As you know, in January we provided guidance for full year revenue and expenses as well as Card NCLs, and that guidance was informed by a number of scenarios and assumptions. Based on what we know today and assuming markets remain open and constructive, we still expect to deliver full year revenues of approximately $83.1 billion-$84.1 billion with net interest income excluding markets up approximately 2%-3%. We expect full year expenses to be slightly lower than $53.4 billion. Clearly there remains a lot of uncertainty, but we are confident that our diversified business model and resilient strategy can withstand many environments and we remain well positioned to support our clients.\nSo while a lot is changing around us, we remain steadfast and focused on continuing to execute on our transformation and strategy while remaining disciplined with our expenses and capital with an eye towards improving returns over time. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time we will open the floor for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press Star five on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself at any time by pressing five again. Please note you'll be allowed one question and one follow up question. Again, that is star five to ask a question and we'll pause for just a moment.\nOkay. Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi, thanks very much.\nI know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a refresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there are, risk but also opportunities in helping clients manage through this retariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I think about nationalization and vertical integration is bad things but a lot of shifting, and maybe you can help clients deal with all that shifting. But anything, any help there would be great.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nGlenn, I would be delighted to do so. So our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. So you think we've got a very broad suite of products and Services, and they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role, the Ukraine-Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and Services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the place that they need it.\nNow, the mix of those different revenues, different products and Services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engagement that we have with our clients all around the world is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we have in all the markets. If I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs? What would it mean? Well, it would dampen economic activity here in the US and abroad. Cross-border trade flows will change. We'll be in the middle of facilitating that. So we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated financing activity that goes with it. Because it's not just about TTS. This is about the bundle of different capabilities we bring to bear.\nTake some comfort, look at what happened with the Ukraine war. We grew a lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is. It's payroll, it's supply management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. We're very deeply embedded into our clients' day-to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. That's not going to change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. I would say I think all of us recognize the environment is very fluid right now. So let me also just say for clarity's sake, the firm-wide level, our ROTCE targets for 2026 are still 10%-11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be different and we'll certainly know more as things get clearer as to how that plays out.\nI think actually the other thing you mentioned about nationalization.\nMost of our clients have been clients for decades. I mean a number of them have been clients for over a century. It would not be British understatement to say that we are deeply embedded into them. I mean it is extraordinary how deep we are. We've been on the ground for over a century and we are viewed as quasi local in most of these markets. Citi is not a bunch of suitcase bankers that fly in. We're not transactional. We're very unique in the footprint and these factors do make us less vulnerable to the different geopolitical dynamics that are going on.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThanks for all that, Jane.\nI'll cede the floor.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe Jane, just following up on that conversation, and you talked about leaning into.\nAs being a port in a storm and leaning into it. So, I guess in the near term, are you seeing sort of demand already in terms of your balance sheet, whether it's raising liquidity and deposit flow, like sort of flight to safety deposit flows, and sort of the trading aspect of it? From this volatility in April, have you sort of already seen greater demands from clients?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nWhat I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening.\nWe've done a number of them as we talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy. But I would say that most clients are pausing their plans now. No one is taking bets in the market right now. We're seeing them prep for more headwinds. So we're seeing some bolstering of already strong balance sheets. Remember, our client base aren't the smaller companies in the mid-market that are going to get more pummeled in this type of environment. So our clients are getting, getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports, of stockpile inventories. We are seeing a pausing on significant CapEx while everyone waits to get clarity on the full agenda. And in that full agenda, remember there's tax bill, there's deregulation actions. These are some positives that will be coming. It's a very big agenda. Clients appreciate it's going to take time.\nIn terms of the trading side, what we're seeing is it is pretty orderly out there. There's a lot of complicated dynamics happening, but it's not being catalyzed by liquidity crisis or other things going on. Let's not fight the war. The last war. The issue we're tackling at the moment is something different, and we're seeing clients taking the opportunity to de-risk. We are, others are so that if we have more turbulence ahead, everyone's in a stronger position for it. And that is a good thing. But it's early days, Jim. We've got to see how this unfolds.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nSure. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe for Mark, I mean, you highlighted at least on a period-end basis deposit growth and commercial loan growth looked pretty good on a period-end basis, quarter over quarter. So I guess when we think about.\nThe NII assumptions, deposit and loan growth looks good. But anything different given the strong start to the NII ex-market story and seemingly some good momentum in deposit and loan growth? Do you feel good, better, worse on sort of your NII outlook for this year?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nThanks, Jim. You know, look, I continue to feel\nGood about the NII outlook. There's obviously uncertainty that Jane has referenced. But that 2%-3% ex Markets we've talked in the past about what the tailwinds and headwinds are and you referenced; we saw some of that play through in the quarter in terms of deposit volumes. We saw good operating momentum in our Services business. In TTS in particular, the loan growth we saw not just in average interest earning balances on the branded Card side, but also saw a trade loan growth as well. And so those are going to be important tailwinds as I think about the balance of the quarter. You've heard me reference as well reinvestment from maturing securities in our investment portfolio into higher yielding assets including cash. And you can see that on the balance sheet that some of that started to take place as well and helping deposit spreads.\nThen the team has been very, very engaged as it relates to deposit repricing and managing beta through the current environment. So the combination of those things along with the removal of the reduction of late fees are really the tailwinds that contribute to that 2%-3% growth. And then there's some headwinds. So lower rates on floating rate assets would be a tailwind. The potential of FX translation primarily in Mexico would be a tailwind. But net net I feel good about the 2%-3% growth in NII ex Markets.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, great, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, I just wanted to continue the discussion about. On the one hand, you're a port in the storm, you've been embedded decades, and you're not a bunch of suitcase bankers. So that message landed. On the other hand, you are the bank that facilitates global trade in the middle of a global trade war.\nAnd so I think the\nConcern is not just the possibility that revenues will not just die, but that credit will implode or as I've heard many, many times that Citigroup is going toStubs its toe just in 100 countries.\nThe mix of it all. What else can you say in addition to what you said to either reassure investors that the oversight is strong or that you have your arms around the situation the best that you can? Again, recognizing that it's a fluid situation.\nThank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nYou've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty wrenching changes in the global economy. You've seen it with, say, the shifts in the supply chains after COVID and then between the geopolitical tensions that are going on. You saw it in pretty significant changes that were happening, the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that. We are where the clients come. It's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities. You see it for how they're looking at changing their financing around. And we tend to. We are the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So from that point of view, we are the active agent in a lot of this mix, and we are a port in the storm. As I said, Mike, we've got very strong balance sheet capital and liquidity to deploy.\nWe have the big strategic changes and organization changes behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot. This is a firm that is much more agile and able to respond and be much more focused on clients right now. I feel good about this.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah.\nThe only thing I'd add, Jane, you're spot on. Right. We come in with a strong balance sheet, strong capital, strong liquidity. If you think about your point around credit, Mike, we've said repeatedly, and you can see it in the numbers we skew towards the higher investment grade, larger multinationals who also come into this with strong balance sheets. We've been very disciplined about that risk framework, our risk appetite, both on the Corporate side as well as as it relates to our consumers. And then what we tend to see in times of stress is a flight to quality as it relates to deposits. And so, again, depending on how this evolves, we're well positioned, you know, to manage whatever the needs are of our clients, whether that be lending needs or the storing of liquidity.\nWe're very well reserved to manage whatever credit risk may come with that, despite us being skewed towards higher quality names in both of those demographics.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. The flip side of this is you did say the drivers are the same. They might be different in magnitude to take you from where you are now. You had over 9% ROTCE in the quarter. You said you're on track to get to 10% or 11% next year. Can you put a little meat on the bones, kind of a verbal waterfall chart if you would? Or maybe some numbers around org simplification, stranded costs, productivity savings, how do we get from the 9% in the first quarter to that magical double digit return target for next year?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nAgain, as we talked about before, it is a combination of continued momentum on the top line, and this is Jane's point around how that mix may evolve. But you know, the 3%+ that we're expecting this year and again in 2026 is an important contribution to that. You often see in our business where one business may be under pressure, the other one tends to outperform and overcompensate. Whether it be banking fees and how those evolve, but volatility that may come with that, that uplifts the markets business. So that continued focus on top line performance will be important. You've heard me reaffirm the expense target for 2025 in terms of getting down to the 53.4. We still have a path to getting less than 53 in 2026. That will be important.\nObviously if revenue softens there, we will see expenses come down in tandem with that combination of volume related transaction costs. But other levers that we will look to pull and the productivity savings we expect to come from prior investment is an important aspect as well. And then we've continued to optimize the use of our balance sheet and the capital that we have. You see that we have brought our CET1 down to 13.4. We're continuing to return capital. Those become very important aspects to getting to that target. Now look, it's uncertain and how the world evolves is hard to forecast at this point. Right. So could a stressed macro environment create an impact on credit and a build of reserves? Absolutely. That could happen towards the end of 2025.\nIf it does happen in 2025 and losses end up showing up in 2026, they end up being self-funded, so to speak, by the reserves that would have been established. So we sit here today and, as Jane mentioned, we're seeing nothing that would suggest that we shouldn't be targeting the 10-11. So we remain committed to that 10-11. There's a path with the combination of those levers that I've mentioned, and, importantly, this quarter is yet another proof point that our strategy is resilient, that we've got the right team on the ground to execute against it, and that it's showing up in our numbers and it's showing up in our returns.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nI just remind everyone we're very different bank than the one we were a few years ago in terms of our business mix, our risk profile, and all the investments we've made into the business. I think you can see us managing the bank, doing what we say we'll do. Please take some confidence in that.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ibrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. I guess Mark just wanted to on slide nine and the capital waterfall.\nI guess we are all thinking about what buybacks can do in the second half of this year. So if you don't mind one, the RWA sort of dragged the 32 basis points. Is that normal as we think about what the RWA consumption should look like? Just talk about that in the context of getting to a 13.1 CET1 by the end of the year and how we can back into the pace of buybacks?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, so I'd say a couple things. So one last quarter we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program and we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year or this quarter, I should say, to $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading and we're clear that that is a smart thing to do. Once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses that's accretive to returns. And so the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We've seen good client demand across the platform.\nThat's helped to drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses. That's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand again accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13 one by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stress capital buffer, you know, in June on the heels of the DFAST, you know, CCAR work that's just been submitted and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast, as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform\nThat downward trajectory. But that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nUnderstood. I guess you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, the results on the Card book went up to 8.2. Remind us, I mean, I think the genesis of both questions is I think there's a fragility to your ROTCE guidance for next year that I think makes investors nervous. I'm just trying to get to the pieces around buybacks. Then in terms of credit, like, what's it baking in around the unemployment rate? What would cause you to ratchet up provisioning in the near term? What kind of an employment market deterioration do we need to see for the credit outlook to deteriorate fast and materially?\nThanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, let me take that in a couple different pieces. So the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our branded Card portfolio, up about 3%. The consumer has, you know, we've seen a shift towards essentials and away from travel and entertainment. There's certainly.\nYou know, a general performance that's consistent with what we've expected. When we look at delinquencies, when we look at the loss rates that played out through the quarter, there are no surprises there as we think about that.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nApril performing in line with that as well.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\nYes.\nApril has been consistent with that. As we think about reserves, you know, we ended the quarter at about $23 billion of reserves across the entire business. That's about a 2.7% reserve to loan ratio. When I look at the drivers of that, as you know, when we do our analysis on a quarterly basis, we have three scenarios that we run, a host of other stress scenarios, but those that inform the CCAR analysis; there are three scenarios. The base case scenario, there's a downside scenario, and there's an upside scenario. As we looked at the macroeconomic outlook and the key variables that go into those scenarios, we assumed a deterioration in that macro outlook and we increased the probability or the weighting towards the downside scenario in light of what we were seeing in the macro environment.\nWhen you look through to some of the key variables or one of the variables you referenced, unemployment, the average unemployment rate was 5.1% across those three scenarios.\nThe unemployment rate. In the downside scenario, the average was 6.7% across those eight quarters. And so we've assumed some pretty meaningful shifts in unemployment, particularly on that downside. In our analysis that informed the increase in our ACL reserves that's referenced in the deck. And that increase was offset a bit by the sequential reduction in volumes that is somewhat seasonal. So hopefully that helps. I feel we feel good about those reserves based on what we know and our current view of the macroeconomic environment. And we'll obviously do that on a quarterly basis as things continue to evolve.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks for walking through that. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\nHi Mark, wanted to ask you about capital optimization levers that you have to. You've made some good progress in RWA mitigation. Is there still some room to go there? And then also could you maybe increase the pace of DTA utilization to reduce the TCE density in a way to help the ROTCE go?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, sure.\nSo look, we're always looking at opportunities to further optimize the use of capital, you know, end markets. We've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to RWA as a tool that we've been using there. That's continued to increase that metric and ratio. We continue to look at are we, are we optimizing balance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we'd expect from our client base? You know, when we do our Corporate Lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as a tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheets. So we're constantly working through this and identifying opportunities to ensure we're getting the highest return on that.\nIn fact, if you look through the material we provided, you'll see that in light of the improvement we've seen across all of our businesses last year as well as our forecast for growth this year, there in fact is a shift in the TCE. And so the allocated TCE has gone down for many of these businesses because they have shown good PPNR growth, good profitability. And so as we stress test it internally, the stress losses with the businesses have in fact come down. Now obviously we have to adhere to the regulatory stress test, and so that shifted from the businesses into Corporate other. But it is a positive sign as we think about how the stress capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments are already showing that improvement.\nThat would suggest lower levels of stress losses. And so that's another important point that we diligently manage even if we can't control the impact on the top, at the top of the house. Your point around DTA, we continue to focus on bringing the DTA down. As you know, that is largely driven by our ability to generate more US income, which we're also very focused on. We did see a pickup this quarter, which is really just a timing difference pickup. It happens in the first quarter of every year. It is tied to, you know, deferred compensation and loan loss reserves as timing difference DTA. And as we earn more income through the balance of the year and obviously create income tax liability, it will utilize that increase we saw or offset that increase we saw in the first quarter.\nHere we are targeting, you know, bringing that down, you know, in 2025 and in 2026, you know, in order to contribute to, to optimizing capital.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks, Mark. I wanted to ask Jane about the Banamex IPO planning. Just an update on where that stands and assuming that market conditions create some risk to the timing, is it fair to say that there are pros and.\nCons from the shareholder perspective to holding.\nOnto that business longer, given that it's a profitable entity?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nLook, first of all, we continue to be on track with the preparation for the IPO. John, I was just down in Mexico last week, and the team's fully focused on driving Banamex's business performance. I was very pleased to see improvements in a lot of the underlying drivers of their performance when I was down there. And they're also focused on getting the work done to be able to go public. Things like the prepared audit financial statements, fulfilling the various regulatory requirements, because we told them we want to see the business performance improving, and we want to make sure that we are doing everything in our control to be in a position to IPO by the year end.\nTo the second part of your question, we will always look at what we believe to be in the best interest of our shareholders. We believe that the best interest of our shareholders is to be able to IPO this business. We think that is the right thing. It fits with Citi's strategy for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. We're the best owner of the Corporate franchise we have there. We are not the best owner of a domestic bank.\nSo the timing of when we IPO will be driven by market conditions. It will be driven by the timing of regulatory approvals. So that could move that from 2025 into 2026. We will always be guided by what we think will maximize value for our shareholders.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat.\nThanks, Jane.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ken Houston with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the points you made about the consumer hanging in there through April. Mark, you mentioned that there could be more uncertainty as we get later. But I believe you know, you're still intact with your charge-off guides for the year. I think just noticing Retail Services was, I think, expectedly higher than the high end at 6.43%. Can you just remind us again how you're expecting the cadence of credit Card losses to the trajectory for both Branded Cards and Retail Services as you go forward? Thanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure.\nAgain, we do obviously feel that we are well reserved here. We did expect to see a pickup in the first half of the year before trending down in the back half of the year. So that's kind of the cadence that we'd expect between now and the end of the year. The first half is usually seasonally higher than the back half of the year. You see that in Retail Services. I would also point out that you can see it in the deck. I think it's the second page of the appendix. But also in the supplement, you are starting to see the delinquency buckets. We show the 90-day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail Services.\nThat is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the go forward. And so that seasonality as well as that trend is a good sign.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nWe've also, I think, one of the pieces Gonzalo and the team have done a good job with is they've been proactive in tightening risk in acquisitions and existing programs in the last couple of years. I think that also puts us into another reason we feel in a good position as we head into whatever lies ahead.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nVery good. And one, just to follow up on NII and your outlook, did you make any changes to it, including Card fees still in the NII guide? Does that now removed, is that still in there? And I know there's a lot of puts and takes given the change in the forward curve. If you can help us understand which curve you're using and some of the balancing acts there, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, so our, you know, so look.\nThe late fee impact is for us, you know, important, and we included it in the range that we had given, and we still feel good. We've now removed it obviously with the changes that have taken place, but we have not changed our range because there's obviously going to be puts and takes that occur.\nIt does have an impact on the Retail Services\nPrint that we have in the quarter. And more importantly, the year-over-year that you see there of down 11% because as you know,\nWe share, you know, profits with those partners. And so you know, that down 11%. That down 11% that we see in the quarter is informed by, you know, last year where we had an assumption that the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore we had less profits to share with our partners versus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and therefore have more profits to share with our partners. And so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in USPB, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentage in the remaining quarters because it's really a byproduct of what we assumed last year versus this year on late fees. In terms of the curve in the NII guidance we gave, we assume two to three cuts. We're now assuming.\nA fourth. But given the timing and that it would be backloaded in the year, it doesn't have a significant impact on the NII guidance that we've given the 2%-3% ex Markets.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nGood morning.",
    "content2": "Jane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nHi, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi.\nTwo questions, just first on the buyback.\nI noticed you came in at $1.75 billion. Is that right? This quarter?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYep.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace, and I'm wondering, does that mean at $175 million or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q on Q, which was $250 million. And so that little.\nI know you're laughing.\nJust trying to understand how you think about that given what we discussed last.\nQuarter, which is you have so much.\nOpportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful.\nIf you don't mind.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, sure.\nSo look, we're targeting a similar level.\nAs you know, we've been working to bring the CET1 down. We brought it down 20 basis points this quarter. We're still focused on bringing it down to 13.1%. There is uncertainty. The uncertainty is multifaceted to some extent. You think about the uncertainty with the SCB, we'll hopefully get some clarity on that, as we often do in the summer, and that will inform the pace at which we bring that down. And then there's the broader market uncertainty, and we want to obviously be there to support clients and the demand that may come on the heels of that. So, you know, this quarter, like I said, similar level of share repurchases, $20 billion program that we will continue to work through, SCB clarity soon, hopefully favorable clarity, and we're steadfast focused on it.\nJane, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nWe like giving shares back in, buying them back and giving capital back to our shareholders. So it's a priority for us, will continue to be.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, excellent. Thank you so much. And then Jane, just separately on Slide 2, you identify the main priorities for\n2025 and 2026, many of which we've talked about here\nThis call. I just wanted to understand from your perspective on the transformation, how, how far along do you feel you are in modernizing your infrastructure.\nWhat kind of timeframe do we have to go from here to check the box on that one, if you ever can check the box? And then separately on the Commercial Banking\nsegment, if you could just give us some insights there too.\nThank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nOkay, there's a lot in there. So, as you remember, the transformation is a very large body of work. We're overhauling our infrastructure, we're reducing and modernizing our applications, we're simplifying our processes, and sort of addressing the different root causes of what held us back thoroughly and once and for all.\nI feel good about the progress we've made. We're seeing more and more of the benefits into how we run the bank. As you know, we fell behind in data, particularly regarding reg reporting. We've taken action to get that into shape, and we're confident in how that's now progressing. In many parts of risk management compliance programs, we're already operating at or close to the target states.\nOur focus is now ensuring we're delivering the risk reductions and the outcomes in a sustainable way. And I'm excited about the work we've been doing in making sure that our technology and our overall control environment is what we call modern and simple. We're simplifying and standardizing controls across common activities. We put a lot more preventative and detective controls in place. We're upgrading others that weren't effective enough. We're driving automation, we're driving straight-through processing of our end-to-end processes across the bank. And you know, you've heard us talk pretty consistently over the last couple of years about the work to make the technology infrastructure onto consolidating onto single platforms, retiring legacy applications. So I'd say where we are, as many of the efforts are now impacting how we run the bank better, more efficiently, and in a much more controlled way.\nThere's still work to do.\nAs you say, I'm not sure\nAny bank finishes its modernization because the pace of innovation is there, and we're still innovating and investing in supporting our businesses with new innovations in different areas. Talk briefly about AI. A lot of work in Services there, USPB, and Andy, and, well, so there's a lot going on. I think you can tell I'm pretty excited about it. I'm pleased where we're headed and at the pace we're heading.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nI forgot to do the Commercial Bank side. We can come back to it.\nSorry Betsy, I forgot to mention the Commercial Bank in my enthusiasm on our modernization effort.\nLook, I think we are positioned to be the go-to bank for commercial clients. So these are ones with cross-border needs.\nWe've got these unique capabilities that particularly the born digital clients who are then going global very quickly. They can just sit on top of our existing capabilities in Services. We help them go global, then we help them think about their IPO or M&A or financing opportunities, and the banking wallet builds on top of it. We've got quite a unique value proposition. I've been very pleased to see the growth we've been seeing in acquiring new companies who will be the future major players as they grow in the global economies. This is happening in many of the biggest bright spots around the world. It's in India, it's in Australia, it's happening in Japan, it's happening through Europe as well as in North America. So a lot of good future growth activities there. Good returns.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll now take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst of Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nHi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up question here on the buyback pacing, your message has been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus tangible book at $90, I guess are you just so scarred from the volatility of the SCB result that that just must be hurdled before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the notion that sometimes happens in these chats with buy-siders about your inability to dividend from the bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could address that too, that would be great.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, sure.\nSo look, we have accelerated the pace of buybacks, and I think this quarter is a good example where I guided for 1,500, and we kicked it up to 1,750, and I think you should expect that, you know, as we see opportunities to continue to do that, that we're going to do it. And you should expect that, you know, given where we are trading relative to book value, that, you know, we're, we're constantly, you know, focused on those opportunities to take it up more, you know, than we had planned or more than expected. Look, I think, I think we are, you know, we have seen a lot of volatility in the SCB, and we're not the only ones. Other players in the industry have as well. I think we're encouraged by the dialogue that we're hearing.\nThere is still some risk to the SCB, you know, coming in different this year versus last year. I think, you know, I don't think we should lose sight. We're not losing sight of that. We'll get more clarity when the SCB comes. I think that'll be important. We obviously are generating good earnings quarter after quarter, which obviously creates the capacity for us to do more here. I think we've evidenced a willingness to do that.\nIn terms of your other question, with regard to your question implying whether there are any restrictions, we don't have any restrictions on a buyback.\nLike, we would not have announced a $20 billion buyback program if we didn't think we could execute the program in a reasonable amount of time. And so, you know, obviously, you know, we disclose what we dividend out from the bank, and you can look at that. Over the last three years, you know, we've dividend arranged somewhere in the range of zero to $5 billion in any given quarter. But again, there are no restrictions imposed by the FRB which governs the parent on the ability to pay dividends, and buy back stock. In addition to that, we have multiple sources of funding, including loans to subsidiaries which could be remitted, as well as debt issuance programs, as well as the earnings that are generated that we are well positioned to do to execute on the program that we've described and to continue our desired pace of buyback.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst of Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nGot it. And just my second question.\nMark, you know, you mentioned the four cuts that's now embedded in your NII outlook. I'm guessing that's for the US. How should we think about how you're thinking of global rates? You know, obviously it's a basket of countries and currencies that we have to think about. And you know, if your top exposures are exposed to lower rates, how should we think about deposit spreads from here?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nI think I'd say, I guess the\nEasiest way to answer the question is to point to, you know, the IRE analysis that we show on a quarterly basis. You know, that's obviously a risk measure. You know, there are a lot of limitations associated with, you know, with taking it too deeply or taking it too literally. But as you know, it is a, you know, a view on how lower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no change in composition or mix, or no changes in our hedging action. And it is an instantaneous, you know, shock to the entire corporation.\nWith that said, we do break out the impact for US dollar versus non US dollar. Remember as you just referenced, there are over 60 currencies.\nThat asset sensitivity would suggest that in the Q4 with a 100 basis point move\nAcross the currencies, the non-US dollar impact would be $1 billion over a 12-month period. So that, you know, take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as to the sensitivity to rates that would assume all of those currencies and rates in those countries moved at the same time across the curve, and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst of Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nGot it, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking my questions, a couple of them as follow-ups to questions that have been asked. First one for you, Mark.\nDoing buybacks of the dividend from the bank to the holding company that we just asked.\nHow much are you willing to let your double leverage go up? Is there any sort of internal limits that you follow? What would be the implications of that from a funding cost standpoint?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, look, we have internal limits, we have management action triggers internally. We're not anywhere close to those limits or triggers. It's not something that I'm worried about as it relates to the buyback program that I have and, or the buybacks that we forecasted over the balance of the year.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nJane,\nHearing about all the turmoil and reading some news stories about mandates being shifted from US broker dealers to local players. Jane, are you concerned about that? Is that a shift that's starting outside the US, and for big players like yourselves and others who are widespread globally, does this start to create stronger competitors or move some business away over time?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nNo, it doesn't.\nWe haven't seen any shifts of business away from us.\nJust remember the nature of our business.\nThese are many of these markets around the world we've been in for over a century. We were the first bank in. Sometimes we're the only international bank in. We truly have a unique footprint that we are everywhere, and we're able to connect everything everywhere. There aren't other banks that have this. They don't have the scale, they don't have the depth of local capabilities, they don't have the risk management skills. You don't have all of these different elements that the clients need now, and they need in this type of environment where things are shifting around. It's very easy to move your supply chains around on our platform to shift the mix of different businesses. You're doing different geographies you're in.\nAnd as I said, a lot of the work we do is very local, and we're at the cutting edge and leading edge in Services, both in TTS, custody in particular. Our Corporate Bank has got very strong deep relationships. We've got balance sheet strength. So you tend to see flights to quality in these environments. And when you're in the emerging market.\nThere is only one word for quality and that's Citi.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nOkay, thanks Jane.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nHi Jane. Hi Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nHey Gerard.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nHey Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nMark, you touched on in your opening comments about the seasonal increase in trading-related assets, and the number, the growth, was very strong. Was there any types of strategies that you guys employed? Because when you go back in other seasonal periods, you know, first quarter of prior years, we've not seen this kind of growth. So what led to this kind of success of growing your trading assets so well this quarter?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, again it's the growth you've seen across the platform in both, both fixed income as well as equities. And so that equities growth obviously of 23% strong performance in derivatives and prime and prime balance growth tied to that, particularly with hedge funds and asset managers as they looked at regional reallocation, strong contribution there, and then Rates and Currencies could increase client activity and portfolio trading. And then we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client activity and loan growth. And so the nature of the activity, the structure of the products, and what have you were all contributing factors there. Really strong performance across the business. And it obviously shows up in both the assets and the trading assets and the trading liabilities and the funding mechanisms associated with that.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good. Then, as a quick follow-up, you guys give us good details about the allocation of equity. I think it was Slide 23. I was curious. I noticed that you lowered some. You know, the total equity doesn't change, of course, but you did lower the allocation of the equity for different lines like Wealth and Banking. What was the thinking behind lowering it in the first quarter relative to 2024?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYes.\nSo as you probably know, Gerard, we kind of look at this on an annual basis. It's a process that we run, and we run it at the end of the year with an eye towards how we want to make adjustments in the year that's following. As we looked at the performance of the business overall, our five businesses have improved their PPNR and their profitability, and therefore improving their resiliency in stress scenarios and reducing their stress losses. And so as we thought about that underlying strength that we saw as well as our forecast for what demand would be through 2025, those were important factors in that allocation or that attribution to the businesses for TCE. So in a way, they're getting the benefit of that improved resiliency even before it shows up in our stressed capital buffer.\nAnd so each of the businesses we talked about, Markets, as a great example, we've been talking about optimizing use of capital, revenue to RWA, and the improvement all last year. We talked about that. And you see that showed up in their performance but also showed therefore in the amount of TCE allocation that they have this year. So hopefully that helps. Obviously, regulatory capital hasn't changed in the aggregate. That's comprised of the RWA, G-SIB, and stress capital buffers. But over time we'd expect, as we've talked about our strategy, we'd expect the exits to obviously continue to come off the balance sheet. And we'd expect our strategy and the resiliency of our PPNR and the steadiness of those earnings to ultimately show up in our stress capital buffer.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGreat. Appreciate the color as always. Thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Just to follow up on the expenses came in a bit lower than expected. Q1 even with the accounting change, what's your thought process for the rest of the year? Because what I'm getting at is often Q1 is the high watermark. So if you trickle down a little bit from here, that would imply costs coming in a bit below what you're at, what you're expecting. Just talk about the trajectory through here.\nThanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure.\nSo again, I kind of stuck to the guidance that we had given in January. So expenses, $53.4 billion for the full year. We did come in at $13.4 billion in the quarter. I kind of went through the puts and takes around that. I'd expect probably a bit of a tick up in Q2 when I think about the things in front of us and some of the continued investment that we plan to make in transformation and some of the other things underneath that, like data and reg reporting. And then I'd expect it to trend down so that we get to the target of the $53.4 billion that I referenced for the full year, and so likely see a tick up and then a trend down and landing the full year at the guidance here.\nObviously, if revenue moves. Sorry, go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nNo, no, please, fast.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nI would say, obviously, if revenue moves in either direction, we'll adjust accordingly. If we have upside to revenue, you'd expect to see some of that variable in transaction cost, you know, move in that direction as well. If we see pressure on revenues, we'll be focused on ensuring that we are, you know, bringing our expenses down. Our expenses down as well.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And just any way to frame how much cost will go up from Q1 to Q2 based on what you're thinking now?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nNo, I'm not giving second quarter guidance kind of beyond what I've factored into the full year at this stage.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, fair enough. All right, thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is not open. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on the expenses. Your 2026 target of 10%-11% ROTCE. I think you're targeting expenses being below $53 billion. Should we. I assume with the accounting change that should recalibrate to being below, call it $53.5 billion. Is that. Or $52.5 billion. Sorry, is that, you know, a fair assumption or conclusion from that?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure.\n$52.6 billion.\nWhich is less than $53 billion. Yeah, yeah, I bet. But yes, I mean, I mean, it's, you know, it's a change in line item in terms of that association fee, and sure, I targeted 2026 as less than $53 billion. And with that $400 million, sure, you can deduct that from the $53 billion.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nGot it. Just wanted to clarify that. And then, I guess, secondly, on Wealth Management, the net new assets are pretty impressive. NNA trend $16.5 billion, I think.\nSomething like 11% of beginning period client assets over the last couple of quarters. So it seems like Andy is really delivering there, just anything in strength across the different products. Anything you want to highlight there as to what's driving that? And any comments just on the durability of that kind of momentum.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nThe strategy that Andy's laid out and talked about is working. We've got the franchise very focused around net new investment assets, bringing those in from the $5 trillion of assets that are off us with existing clients, as well as new wealth that is being created, and new clients that we're bringing to the franchise. And so I'm very pleased as well with the caliber of the team that he has brought to bear here. We've got real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities. And he's also investing to improve client experience. A new relationship with Palantir here as well. And it's a team that's on the front foot. And in this environment around the world, clients are really looking to us for advice because there are not many global wealth managers.\nThey're looking to us from our global perspective, the capabilities we've got on the ground all around the globe, and helping put them into a good position amidst the uncertainty. So we are a destination of choice right now and we're taking full advantage of it. I don't see that changing. This is the strength of Citi. The strategy is working.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nGreat.\nThat's good to hear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you all for joining us. We appreciate all the questions. Have a great afternoon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Citi's Q1 2025 earnings call.\nYou may now disconnect."

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJen Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our Q4 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, Citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nThank you, Jen, and a very good morning to everyone. I'm going to start with a macro backdrop and then walk you through our results for the full year. I'll share some thoughts on the progress we're making executing our strategy and then conclude with why we have decided to adjust our 2026 return target. We entered 2025 with strategic clarity and good momentum across all our businesses. From the global macro perspective, economies have done a good job tolerating hikes from central banks, and inflation has clearly been receding. While policies will certainly impact economic activity, whether in the form of tariffs or taxes, 2025 doesn't look that different from 2024.\nThe US remains at the heart of the macro picture. Growth is not only being driven by the higher-end consumer but also by a strong, innovative corporate sector. China's growth has been slower than expected, but there is still the prospect of further stimulus. Europe continues to underachieve, and many emerging markets have reemerged as bright spots, a trend which certainly benefits us given our global network and deep presence in countries such as India, and throughout the Middle East and ASEAN. I told you 2024 was a critical year, and I'm proud of what we accomplished and how our businesses performed.\nWe finished with a very strong Q4, which Mark will detail shortly. For the full year, our net income was up nearly 40% to $12.7 billion. We exceeded our full-year revenue target with revenues up 5% ex-debentures. Fee revenue was up 17%, and we saw a smaller impact from Argentina's currency devaluation. We delivered expenses within our guidance and improved our efficiency ratio by 340 basis points, while increasing investment in our transformation. Our ROTCE grew over 200 basis points, albeit from a low level. Our five core businesses each generated positive operating leverage for the full year, which we also achieved at the firm level.\nServices was up 9% and had another record year despite the low-rate environment as a result of new mandates and our emphasis on fee growth. We grew share in both TTS and Security Services. Capped by our best Q4 in a decade, Markets was up 6%. The performance of this franchise in a low-volatility year shows the benefits of our diversified product mix. Equities was strong throughout and was up 26% in what was a record year for us. Banking was up 32% as we gained share across all three investment banking products, and we announced an innovative $25 billion Private Credit partnership with our long-term client, Apollo.\nUnder Viswas's leadership, we expect to continue to gain on our competition in 2025 and beyond. 2024 was the turning point for wealth as we sharpened our focus on investments, right-sized the expense base, and improved the client experience. Revenue was up 7% for the year, including fee growth of 18%. Citi's Q4 and Asia were particularly strong, and net new investment asset flows grew a very pleasing 40%. We attracted top talent throughout the year in wealth, most recently bringing in Kate Moore as our CIO and Anne McCosker as our Head of Lending.\nThis business has tremendous potential with both new and existing clients, and we're really leaning into it. USPB revenues were up 6%, driven by borrowing across both card portfolios and by fee growth. We announced a 10-year extension of our co-branded partnership with American Airlines, ensuring that this valuable relationship enters into its fifth decade. With the acquisition of the Barclays portfolio, we will become American Airlines' exclusive partner in 2026, and we expect to deliver more value for our cardholders and higher returns for our shareholders as a result.\nWe grew our tangible book value per share by 4% and ended 2024 with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement. After repurchasing $1 billion in common shares during the Q4, we returned almost $7 billion in capital to our common shareholders in 2024. Given how committed we are to returning capital, I am particularly pleased to announce that our board authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program. You can see the very tangible progress we're making in executing the strategy that we laid out at our Investor Day three years ago.\nWe have materially simplified our firm since then. We exited consumer businesses in nine countries, a near completion of wind-downs in three, and are on track to exit the final two. This includes Banamex, which we legally separated from our institutional business in December. We're now fully focused on getting ready to IPO, with the timing heavily dependent on regulatory approvals and market conditions, of course. To align our structure with our strategy, we went through a significant simplification of our organization, removing management layers and the regional construct.\nThis has accelerated decision-making and made us a better partner to our clients. We have strengthened our culture by better aligning compensation with our shareholders' interests, enhancing our scorecards to ensure we're delivering for clients. We attracted top industry talent throughout our organization, and that includes new leaders around my table for banking, wealth, and technology. We have raised the bar on what we demand from each other and what we expect to deliver to our clients. We have continued to innovate to improve the client experience and our efficiency.\nWe are now live with Citi Payment Express in 18 countries and have converted 4 million retail bank customers to our simplified banking platform in the US. We accelerated our use of AI, arming 30,000 developers with tools to write code, launched two AI platforms to make 143,000 colleagues more efficient. The investments we're making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes, and automate controls are changing how we run the bank. We consolidated our balance sheet reporting to one unified ledger. We implemented a cloud-based solution for risk analytics to better value trading assets.\nWe have closed out three long-standing consent orders. Our capital, liquidity, and reserves are robust. Our focused strategy, simpler structure, and targeted client selection have all reduced our risk profile significantly. We have made considerable progress on our transformation. While there are areas that are more advanced, there are others where we still have a lot more work to do, particularly around data and regulatory reporting, as last summer's regulatory actions reinforced.\nWe have reviewed the entire data program and made changes to its governance and structure, as well as increased the level of investment. As CEO, I want this company set up for long-term success and to ensure that we have enough capacity to invest for that. In terms of expense guidance, therefore, most of the saves from the org simplification and stranded costs will be used to fund the additional investments we need to make this year in both transformation and technology.\nAs a result, we expect our total expenses in 2025 to be slightly below the 2024 level and to deliver another year of positive operating leverage. We expect our elevated expense level to be temporary and for it to keep coming down beyond 2025. However, when we take the required investments into account, we now expect our 2026 ROTCE to be between 10% and 11%. The 2026 ROTCE is a waypoint. It is not a destination. Our intention is to continue to improve returns well above that level, and we are accountable for doing so.\nWe are relentless in our determination to run the bank more efficiently, fulfill Citi's potential, and meet the expectations of our shareholders. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to acknowledge the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles. Many of our clients and several of our colleagues have lost their homes, and we will do whatever we can to help them recover from this devastating event. They and their loved ones are in all of our thoughts at Citigroup. Now, over to Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the Q4 and full-year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I'll also focus on our current expectations for 2025 and 2026. On slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm, which reflect improved performance both in the quarter and the year. As a reminder, in the Q4 of last year, revenues were significantly impacted by Argentina currency devaluation. Adjusted revenues and non-interest revenues for the full firm and services are shown in the appendix of the earnings presentation on slide 36.\nThis quarter, we reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $1.34, and an ROTCE of 6.1% on $19.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our businesses. Total revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Net interest income excluding markets was roughly flat, with growth in USPB and wealth offset by declines in corporate other and banking.\nNon-interest revenues excluding markets was up 40%, driven by continued strong fee momentum across services, banking, and wealth, along with lower partner payments in USPB, as well as a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Total markets revenues were up 36%. Expenses were $13.2 billion, down 18%, largely driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment, and restructuring charge in the prior year.\nExcluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment and the severance-related impacts, expenses were down 7%, driven by the absence of the restructuring charge in the prior year and savings associated with our organizational simplification, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, largely consisting of cards, net credit losses, and ACL builds. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves, with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.7%. On a full-year basis, we delivered $12.7 billion of net income with an ROTCE of 7%.\nOn slide 8, we show full-year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2024. This year, we delivered $81.1 billion of revenue, up 5% on an ex-VIE basis, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Services revenues increased 9% to $19.6 billion, benefiting from a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, fee growth, and higher deposit volumes. Markets revenues increased 6% to $19.8 billion, primarily driven by growth in equities, which had its highest annual revenue in a decade, and spread products.\nBanking revenues increased 32% to $6.2 billion, largely driven by growth in investment banking, with fees up 42% as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share on an increased wallet. Wealth revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion, primarily driven by a 15% increase in non-interest revenue as we continue to grow client investment assets. USPB revenues increased 6% to $20.4 billion, driven by growth in cards as we continue to see strong customer engagement and an increase in interest-earning balances, as well as lower partner payments.\nOverall, this year demonstrates another year of performance consistent with our medium-term target of 4% to 5 annual growth and the value of our diversified business model. On slide 9, we show the full-year expense trend from 2021 to 2024. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment, our full-year expenses were $53.8 billion, in line with our target. Expense reduction was driven by savings related to our organizational simplification and stranded cost reduction, as well as lower restructuring and repositioning charges.\nOrganizational simplification, stranded cost reduction, as well as efforts to drive efficiencies across the businesses contributed to a net decline of roughly 10,000 direct staff. These savings were mostly offset by higher volume-related expenses, as well as investments in the transformation and other risk and controls, and the civil money penalties. As you can see at the bottom of the page, we spent $2.9 billion on transformation this year, which includes investments in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, and data.\nTransformation investments were up 1%, driven by an increase in certain programs, including data, largely offset by a reduction in the transformation bonus award. We spent $11.8 billion on technology, focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience, and other areas such as cybersecurity. Turning to slide 10, we provide details on our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which decreased 3% sequentially, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation. In the Q4, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into loans while maintaining 116% LCR and $933 billion of available liquidity resources.\nOur $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. We maintain strong capital, ending the year with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.1%. For the year, we returned nearly $7 billion in the form of common dividends and repurchases to our shareholders. Turning to the businesses on slide 11, we show the results for Services for the Q4 and full year.\nServices revenues were up 15%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation and reflecting continued momentum across Security Services and TTS, both of which gained share this year. NIR increased 61%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers such as US dollar clearing, commercial card spend, cross-border transactions, and assets under custody and administration.\nNII was roughly flat as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by the impact of lower interest rates in Argentina. Expenses increased 1%, driven by continued investment in technology and platform modernization, partially offset by productivity savings. On the credit was $112 million, with a net ACL build of $84 million and net credit losses of $28 million. Average loans increased 5%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans.\nAverage deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $1.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the year, and continues to deliver a high ROTCE, coming in at 29.9% and 26% for the year. On Slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the Q4 and full year. Markets saw its highest Q4 revenue in a decade and increased 36%, with broad-based gains across all products. Fixed Income revenues increased 37%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were up 39%, and Spread Products and other Fixed Income up 30%, both reflecting increased client activity.\nRates and Currencies also benefited from a conducive trading environment compared to a challenging prior year quarter. Spread Products and other Fixed Income was driven by credit and mortgage trading, as well as higher securitization volume. Equities revenues increased 34%, driven in part by strong execution of strategic client transactions in cash equities. Momentum also continued in prime, with balances up approximately 23%. Expenses decreased 8%, primarily driven by lower legal expenses and productivity savings.\nProvision for credit losses was $134 million, driven by a net ACL build primarily related to spread products. Average loans increased 6%, primarily driven by asset-backed lending in spread products, as well as margin loans in equities. Average trading account assets increased 15%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries and foreign government securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $1 billion and $4.9 billion for the year, and delivered an ROTCE of 7.4% and 9.1% for the year.\nOn slide 13, we show the results for banking for the Q4 and full year. Banking revenues were up 27%, largely driven by Investment Banking, with fees up 35%, as we saw growth across all products. BCM was driven by continued investment-grade issuance momentum and increased leverage finance activity. BCM saw strong issuance activity, particularly in follow-on and convertible instruments. In M&A, growth was driven by continued strong client engagement, as well as the completion of previously announced acquisitions, given the more conducive macro environment.\nFor the year, we gained share across regions, products, and several sectors, including healthcare and technology. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, decreased 24%, driven by lower revenue share and volumes, partially offset by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reduction as we right-sized the workforce and expense base, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses.\nOn the credit was a benefit of $240 million, driven by a net ACL release of $247 million, primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the Q4 in a row and delivered net income of $356 million and $1.5 billion for the year, and delivered an ROTCE of 6.5% and 7% for the year. On slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the Q4 and full year. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we're making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue.\nRevenues were up 20%, driven by a 22% increase in NIR as we grew investment fees, with client investment assets up 18%, including net new investment assets of $16 billion. NII increased 20%, driven by higher average deposit spreads and volumes. Expenses decreased 3%, driven by the continued benefit of headcount reductions as we right-sized the workforce and expense base. End-of-period client balances increased 8%, driven by higher client investment asset flows and market valuation.\nAverage deposits increased 3%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Average loans decreased 1% as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated a pre-tax margin of 21% and another quarter of positive operating leverage, delivering net income of $334 million and $1 billion for the year, and delivered an ROTCE of 10.1% and 7.6% for the year. On slide 15, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the Q4 and full year. US Personal Banking revenues were up 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments.\nBranded Cards revenues increased 7%, with interest-earning balance growth of 7% as payment rates continued to normalize, and we continued to see spend growth, which was up 5%. Retail Services revenues increased 7%, driven by lower partner payments and interest-earning balance growth of 3%. Retail Banking revenues were roughly flat as the impact of higher deposit spreads was offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business.\nExpenses decreased 2%, driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Provision for Credit Losses was $2.2 billion, largely driven by Net Credit Losses, as well as a build primarily for volume growth. Average deposits decreased 18%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business.\nUSPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $392 million and $1.4 billion for the year, and delivered an ROTCE of 6.2% and 5.5% for the year. On slide 16, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 34%, primarily driven by net investment securities losses as we repositioned the portfolio, higher funding costs, and closed exits and wind-downs.\nExpenses decreased 51%, primarily driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment, and restructuring charge in the prior year, as well as the reduction from the closed exits and wind-down. Cost of credit was $397 million, with net credit losses of $257 million and a net ACL build of $140 million, primarily driven by Mexico. Turning to slide 18, where I will walk you through our current expectations for 2025. As a reminder, what underpins our current expectations is a reflection of a number of scenarios that include different macro and capital market environments.\nBased on what we know today, we expect revenues to be around $83.5 to 84.5 billion, a roughly 3% or 4% increase year-over-year. We expect a continuation of the NIR ex-markets momentum we saw this year, driven by investment banking as we continue to gain share in the areas of strategic focus, such as healthcare, technology, as well as leveraged finance, and sponsors, assuming a constructive industry wallet. Wealth supported by a continued focus on growth in client investment assets and banker productivity, which will drive investment revenue.\nServices as we execute the strategy we laid out at our investor day in June, expanding our leadership position with large institutions and growing our market share with commercial clients, and TTS. In Securities Services, continuing to gain share through investments in our digital and data capabilities while deepening with asset managers, and asset owners. Turning to slide 19, we expect NII ex-Markets to be up modestly this year. However, there are several tailwinds and headwinds that I will walk you through.\nLooking at the left-hand side of the page, we expect most of the increase to come from volume growth and mix, primarily driven by higher loan volumes in USPB, mainly in cards, and deposit volumes in Services. We expect a continued benefit from lower-yielding investment securities rolling off and being repriced into higher-yielding assets, such as cash, loans, and securities. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are several headwinds, including various scenarios around lower rates, both in US and non-US, which we expect to be mostly offset by repricing actions across the franchise, as well as the potential impact of card late fee reduction and FX.\nTurning to slide 20, we expect expenses to be slightly lower than $53.8 billion for 2025. Our expectations reflect continued benefits from our organizational simplification, reduction in stranded costs, and productivity savings from our prior investments. However, offsetting most of these benefits are increased investments in the transformation, technology, and the businesses, as well as higher volume-related expenses.\nEmbedded in our outlook for the year is roughly $600 million for repositioning, which remains elevated as we continue to reduce stranded costs, drive efficiencies across the businesses, and as benefits from investments in transformation and technology allow us to eliminate manual processes. As Jane said, we recognize that our expense base remains elevated, and we remain very focused on bringing down our expenses each year while ensuring that we have enough capacity to invest in the company.\nNow, turning to slide 21, I'll talk you through our expectations for returns going forward. As we enter 2025 and think forward to 2026, we continue to have a clear path to improve returns. Having gone through another robust planning process and having provided revenue and expense targets for 2025, we want to update you on our 2026 ROTCE target range. In 2026, we expect continued revenue growth from both NII and NIR, with drivers largely consistent with recent performance. We expect expenses to decline from 2025 and are targeting an expense level below $53 billion.\nThe reduction in our expense base will come from a decrease in legacy and stranded costs, a more normalized level of severance, and an increase in productivity savings from our prior investments. We will maintain strict discipline on the entire expense base, looking for more opportunities to drive further efficiencies as we go into 2026. We also remain laser-focused on continuing to optimize RWA, but as you know, the future of capital rules and therefore requirements remain uncertain.\nIn light of all of this, we are now targeting an ROTCE in the range of 10% to 11 in 2026. We're committed to driving positive operating leverage and improving our returns every year for both the firm and the businesses, and we will do so in a sustainable way, which will set this company up for long-term success. With that in mind, as part of the $20 billion share repurchase program, we plan on buying back $1.5 billion of common stock in Q1.\nAs we take a step back, 2024 represents another year of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firm-wide and business performance, as well as continued execution against our transformation. As we enter 2025, these priorities remain critical as we continue to make progress on improving our returns. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we'll now open the floor for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself at any time by pressing star five again. Please note you'll be allowed one question and one follow-up question. Again, that is star five to ask a question. And we'll pause for just a moment. Okay. Our first question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just, I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the reduction in the ROTCE target in 2026 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given higher investments in the transformation, but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. So when we think about, and we appreciate the below 53 for 2026, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of eliminating running parallel systems, reduced consultant spend, and all that stuff? Is there still that path to a 60% or lower efficiency ratio? Thanks.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nWell, happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context here. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. The first one is driving the business performance, and the second is executing the transformation. You've seen this quarter. You've seen last quarter. You've seen the full year. Our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to.\nThe strategy is working. We've changed the business mix. We're generating more fee-based revenues. You see that in services, with NIR up 37% this year, wealth, with NIR up 15%, IB fees up 35%, an important part of the mix around the quality of our earnings. We said services is a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns. It's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We made a strategic play in Wealth, and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally with a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do.\nWe've consistently delivered on our revenue and expense targets, and I see a lot more opportunity and more upside to strengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty excited by it. The second priority, transformation. I got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in risk, in compliance, in accountability. I'm kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent.\nData is an area we have more work to do in. We increased our investments last year, as you know. And then, as part of the annual planning process, we took a big step back to reassess our plan. I decided, along with Mark and the management team, we needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulator's expectations.\nI'm confident that the decision to do that, look, it was the right one. It's the right one for our transformation efforts. It's certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short-term decision to cut other investments that are important for our long-term investment and competitiveness. I'm just not going to do that. You shouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this 2026 target is a waypoint, not the final destination.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nAnd if I can just add.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOh, yeah, please, Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, thanks. I just wanted to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to less than 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that we're building a franchise that will have continued and sustainable top-line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies, stranded costs, and legacy franchise expenses from the organization.\nAnd the benefits from these investments we've made in the transformation will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so the combination of those things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So yes, there is still a path, and we are focused on that path.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback, great to see the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, can't help but ask about beyond Q1. If we do sort of get this more certainty, maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily lower the buffer to take advantage of your trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and accelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the buyback program at $20 billion. I think in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that, as well as the recognition that we are trading below book and not where we want to be.\nYou've heard both Jane and I speak to the importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks. We've increased that to 1.5 billion. I think that supports that same degree of confidence that we have in the momentum. We are constantly looking at every year on an annual basis as we go through our planning process at the management buffer that we have of 100 basis points. Despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1, our target is the 13.1. So as we get, as we go through the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you'll see us continue to manage down to that 13.1.\nAnd obviously, the two important characteristics that we keep, or drivers that we keep in mind, is the opportunity to invest more in the business at accretive returns and where we're trading and the need to do more buybacks in order to reflect the underlying value. So target's 13.1. We continue to look at that management buffer as the regulatory environment evolves, and we'll continue to do more in the way of capital actions as that makes sense.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large Cap Banks, Truist Securities\n\nThank you, Mark. Just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when you look at the 10% to 11 ROTCE target for 2026, is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or using the 13.1 as the target, and then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified and the franchise gets simplified?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. Hey, John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11 ROTCE target we've set for 2026 does assume that we are running and using a 13.1 CET1 ratio. Obviously, there'll be an SCB that comes out sometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you, and we'll factor those in as we know more about them. But yes, it does assume the 13.1, which is our management target, if you will, for CET1.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst Large Cap Banks, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Great. Then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this year for card net charge-offs? I understand the quarterly cadence has seasonality, but for the full year, it sounds like you're expecting the charge-offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of clarify that, and then maybe just talk about provision build, which you had a lot of in 2024, and whether that could slow down as the maturation of balances slows down? Thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nSure. So in terms of the net credit losses in the forecast that we have, we are expecting that the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards, that 3.5% to 4 is the full-year range that we've given. In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25, excuse me. And so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end.\nAlthough, and I'm sorry, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, and we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year. But remember, that is a full-year NCL rate, and we know that there's seasonality through the quarters. And so you'll see movement through the quarters based on that dynamic. And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there.\nOne is obviously volume, and we do expect to see volume growth in USPB. So that'll be an important factor in how the CECL calculations are done. And then the second driver is obviously, as you know, we run models, and the models, they have a base scenario. They have a downside and upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors: unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera. And our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or downside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning. And so that's kind of how we think about that going into 2025. I hope that helps.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nHead of US Large Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses, including that $600 million repositioning this year. So they were down in 2024. You're guiding them lower in 2025, and you guide them lower in 2026 again. And you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher revenues based on what you said. I didn't see that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that, Mark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues through at least 2026. Is that correct?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nHead of US Large Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nAnd again, sorry, go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nHead of US Large Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nNo, you go ahead.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nNo, I mean, I think you described it correctly. We're seeing continued momentum on the top line, and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in 2024, a tad bit in 2025, and then more in 2026.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nHead of US Large Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Then I guess just for Jane, well, that beats haggis on toast if you achieve that. But I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. I mean, if you have $5 billion of stranded costs and transformation costs in 2024, and some of that goes down, I heard you're investing in tech and transformation and volume and the businesses.\nAnd there's always a trade-off between the bottom-line results you show today and the growth you show in the future. It seems like you're going to get this done, the lower expenses, while you're leaning into a little bit extra growth. So talk about that trade-off and where you're leaning in for growth a little bit more.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nWell, first of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast. It's haggis with mashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone. It's Robert Burns Night coming up soon. On expenses, Mike and everyone, expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I, but for the entire management team. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi. And you've seen that, as you referenced. We've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of years.\nWe've been driving positive operating efficiency. We're all very focused on improving our operating expense base, consolidating technology, the simplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the firm, using AI tools now, our location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that we're really looking at: how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern, and getting it to the level it should be for the revenues that we generate?\nWe all want transformation to get done quickly, and we want it to get done right. So that is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that are needed there. This is not all run rate. And as you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long-term investments in our growth and competitiveness for short-term expediency. This is a waypoint. It's not a destination. And we know what we need to do. We've got our arms around all of this. We're just getting on with execution.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck (Morgan Sta\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Financial Research and US Large Cap Banks\n\nHi, good morning. Jane, just to follow up on what you mentioned, as you do execute, we all expect, or at least I do, that the market will be giving you credit for that execution, meaning multiples should increase. So I'm a little bit, I have a few questions here on the buyback because right now, today, as we all know, you're trading below book. It has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today. And why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide?\nI mean, the old guide was 11% to 12 ROTCE. New guide, 10% to 11. I'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the accretion to tangible book, it's got to be the easiest thing to do to help that ROTCE go up when you compare and contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting the ROTCE up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that $20 billion? Thank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nYeah, yeah, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say, I can hear the determination in your voice. I think it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital to shareholders, period, or full stop. We've got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital turnover the last few quarters. I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel III scenario firmly off the table.\nWe have, nonetheless, a 13.1 CET1 ratio that we put in the plan. That can change over time as well. There's not complete certainty around where the capital requirements are going to go. We hope there'll be a holistic one that is reflective of the risk profile of the bank that's been improving significantly over the last few years. So we have some great growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by what we see in Wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in Banking.\nWe've got some very important investments and an investment agenda that we're putting in to help us continue growing the bank, gaining competitiveness in a responsible way. I'll just conclude with exactly your point. The bar is high on those investments. We don't make them unless we see extremely attractive marginal ROTCE, and there's a lot of things we say no to in order to put the $20 billion program in place. In terms of timing, like our peers, we're not committing to a particular timeframe from this, but you can see our commitment. You can hear our commitment.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess maybe, Jane, I want to follow up on a couple of segments. I think you said 2024 turning point for wealth, and we've seen very steady progress on the ROTCE in wealth. Just talk to us in terms of Andy has been in the seat for a year now. You've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively, both in the US and abroad, as you think about going head-to-head with some of your global peers, and where are the most likely growth opportunities over the next year or two?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nYes. So our vision, my vision, is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships, all around the world, which we're just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have $5.3 trillion of us from existing clients. I think the fact that I find interesting is 55% of it; it's almost $3 trillion, with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the US. We're also very well positioned to capture new wealth.\nJust think about what Citi does in terms of our footprint, our capabilities; really supports wealth creation from the commercial bank, our investment banking side, markets, obviously services supporting it too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen wealth relationships with our clients. We brought in Andy. Andy greatly sharpened the focus on the investment business. This is where we see this big upside. He's been building a differentiated value proposition around wealth creation.\nHe's been leveraging a lot of the leading capital market capabilities, the different relationships we have with PE firms, asset managers around the world, to get a great platform in place, and importantly, improving our client experience, again, particularly around investments, asset allocation, performance, et cetera. What I also have got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity, something that we're doing across the firm.\nI'm also excited by the talent he's bringing in, the market leaders like Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space. And we've made a lot of investments in training and building this investment culture that we didn't have before. So to your point, the proof points are working. Q4 revenue up 20%, operating margin at 21% on its way to 25% to 30, 10% ROTCE on its way to 15% to 20. These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that march.\nThe number I'm most excited by, net new investment assets inflow of $42 billion, up 40% year-over-year. The strategy is working. We're going to be a leader in wealth, the growth opportunities, Asia, US, Middle East, all the places where we are with our existing clients and the new wealth generators of the future.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nIf I can draw a parallel to the banking segment, where the ROTCE is about 5% to 6 last few quarters, there you brought in Viswas Raghavan from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of, could we see a similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve that ROE?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nYeah, I think absolutely. A strong performance. The strategy we have in place is delivering nicely. So if you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year and gaining share, all three products, we've been gaining share in all of the geographies we're in. I'm really excited and happy to see the healthcare and the technology as two areas that we've been investing heavily behind. And you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key transactions, the biggest transactions last year: Mars, Kellanova, single advisor, big role in Boeing. And then just this week, the J&J acquisition of Intra-Cellular.\nSo the deals that matter, this is where you're seeing Citi playing a leading role in. So when this journey, the mandate, a bit similar to Andy, become a top three investment bank, deliver the full potential of one Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in capital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross-firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people.\nWe've been bringing in some great new talent. We've also been cutting some of the unproductive spend. So I think what you can see is we're just on a path of systematically growing our wallet, will be improving our operating margin, generating higher returns. That should be your expectation over the next couple of years of what you'll see from us. And as we head into a great environment in 2025, that should be pretty conducive for a lot of client activity. I'm very confident we're well positioned. We've got the groundwork done to take advantage of it.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThank you, Bram. I thought I heard you say ROTCE of 5%. It's actually 7% for the full year for banking and on its way to the target that we've set of mid-teens for our banking business.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Erica Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nThank you. I hate to ask the umpteen question on the buyback, but clearly the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive.\nAnd so what are the specific mile markers that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that 1.5 billion a quarter to something that is more suggestive of a pace that would be in line with that 20 billion authorization? And I know that this has been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We have some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. What are those specific mile markers? I mean, you're doing it on the PPNR side, right? What do you need to see to gain even more confidence, again, in leaning, to Betsy's words, to go all in on the buyback?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi",
    "content2": "Yeah. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I've said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for CET1 is 13.1, right? And so what you're going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target. That's kind of one point. The second point, I want to be clear that it's not the Consent Order. That's not something that is impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum. I'm managing towards a 13.1 CET1 ratio.\nYou'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1. The one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already, is that we obviously have another CCAR process, stress test, that we will go through. None of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from an SCB point of view, but that'll be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year in terms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nSo I hope that helps. There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place. This is us planning and forecasting the performance of the franchise, ensuring that we can fuel high-returning growth opportunities so that we're building a sustainable franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the management buffer that we've put in place, and therefore taking that excess capacity and putting it towards buybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in. And what I mean by that are the capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it as we sit here today.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nGot it. And just my second question as we think about 2026. And again, I don't want to put words in your mouth because clearly it's very critical in terms of your targets and hitting them. So you targeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume, like Jim was asking, that $51 to 53 billion is not the target, but it's less than $53 billion? To that end, I mean, just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said something very important in that you want to get to the returns in a sustainable way.\nClearly, your shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. Should we just really think of this as, look, it takes a while to turn around a money center bank. In 2026, it may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there in 2027, 2028 anyway. We're just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of investments.\nI guess I'm just trying to think about everybody's super focused on what you had said previously, and now you have different targets. But is it just really like, look, it just takes longer? We'll get there, but it just takes longer. And maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11 ROTCE in terms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy the excess capital that you get back?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nYeah. Erica, we chose the words very carefully to say that 2026 is a waypoint. It's not the destination. And when I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 2027, 2028. What is the bank that we want to be in terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions? We just relentlessly keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it.\nOur potential is for more than our medium-term target, ROTCE. The potential of the bank and the journey that we're on is to improve our returns beyond there, for sure. Then you asked a question about Banamex. On that front, look, we had a singular focus on the separation of two banks. That was an enormous body of work because we had to put up Mexico's eighth-largest bank, standalone, in a very short period of time. It got done 1 December. That was over 100 regulatory approvals to get that done. Now we have turned our full attention to the IPO.\nWe're getting ready to be able to IPO as soon as we can. But given market conditions and given regulatory approvals, it's possible this could go into 2026, but we're doing everything in our control to be ready as soon as possible. We are not the right owner of the bank. We are committed to the simplification of Citi. We will follow a responsible process here.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in mind that the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes in two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale, and two is the risk-weighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation. So that's the point where we've gotten or we've IPO'd more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the RWA release when we fully divest our stake.And so hopefully that helps, but it's not until we've deconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the CTA and other things like that kind of flow through the P&L for Banamex.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nHi.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nHey.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJane, I'll pass on the haggis, but I'll take you up on the whiskey.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nI didn't say I was buying, just to be clear.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your comments about the IPO with Banamex, can you guys remind us or refresh our memories on when the IPO process starts, what will you be once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second, have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss, as you just referenced, it will go through the P&L?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. We haven't given you any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And so Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step having been completed on 1 December with the separation. We are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO. There'll obviously be important filings associated with that, given our intent to dual list. There'll be regulatory approvals that are required kind of as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process. And so there's a series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue to ready ourselves.\nThere are things that we don't control, like, as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval process and timing for that, as well as the market conditions. So all of those factors are important. Then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow-on tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation.\nSo I haven't given you an exact timing on that, but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen over kind of a 12-month, 18-month, 24-month period. Then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation, at which point that Currency Translation Adjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through the P&L. Then ultimately, we exit 100% over the course of time. So I'm sorry I'm not giving you precise dates and percentages. And part of that is because we are obviously on the front end of not only readying ourselves, but considering alternative IPO structures and potential investors/shareholders as part of that process.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nWell, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean this \"what have you done for me lately\" type question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the US Personal Banking? Many of your questions today is about the ROTCE consolidated and how you can improve that. And this business has a very low ROTCE, as you guys know, below your cost of capital.\nAnd structurally, when you look at it, you look at the loans at the end of period, just over 220 billion. Your deposit's about $90 billion, which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nLet me just chat a bit through this. So what's the path to the high returns in US Personal Banking? It's coming from top-line revenue growth, improved expense base, and also a more normalized credit environment. That gets us to the mid to high-teens returns in the medium term. I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points. I talked about banking wealth earlier. We've had another good quarter of revenue growth. We've had the ninth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.\nSo, I think you should be getting some comfort around that. What's going to drive that growth? Co-branded, we just extended with American to be their sole issuer. It's going to give exciting benefits to the American Airlines and the Citi cardholders. And it will be beneficial for both our growth and our returns. In the proprietary front, we're investing. There's a lot of investment in innovation to drive growth. So, refresh the Strata Premier Card. We've been enhancing the reward offerings.\nYou're seeing us often now number one in recognitions and awards around that area. Retail Services being fiercely focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top-line growth. And then Retail Banking, there we're driving primary checking growth. We've put in Simplified Banking so we get a much more streamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship-based banking approach as opposed to a transactional one. Importantly as well, the retail bank's been feeding our wealth business.\nYou heard me earlier talking about that almost $3 trillion US investment opportunity that we have from the retail banking customer base. We transferred $17 billion of deposits from USPB to wealth. So we've got to take those dynamics into account. So I hope you're taking from me. I feel confident in our ability to get to the medium-term targets we set for the business of mid to high teens. I feel comfortable about the growth trajectory that we've got based off the innovations we're putting through, the changes, good expense discipline, and a better credit environment. So when you look at the mix of our business, you'll see us performing nicely here.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Large Cap US Bank Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. I just want to follow up on page nine where you break out the technology and transformation investment spend. And sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two levels in your 2025 and 2026 expense guidance? I know directionally you said it's going up, but did you get a magnitude?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nI did not. Obviously, for both technology and transformation, those are areas that we are going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the number in 2025 being slightly down from the 53.8. But they also represent, as I mentioned, what we believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done.\nAnd so those numbers will increase. There are lots of puts and takes, as you know, through an annual expense forecast, right? Including, as you would expect, we've got volume. We got revenue growth here that's going to come with volume growth, volume, incentive comp, there's merit increases that go with that. And then we also have a series of productivity actions that are playing through to offset those headwinds.\nWhether it be the additional carryover from the org simplification and full-year impact of that or some of the legacy stranded coming down. So there are puts and takes, but transformation and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest in in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to drive sustainable growth going forward.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Large Cap US Bank Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd I guess, how do you know that the recent increase that you're modeling internally in these areas, how do you know you're spending enough and in the right ways to address your goals in the transformation and also satisfy the regulatory requirements?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nWell, if I jump in, I feel very confident indeed that we know what we need to do. We know what we need to be spending on. Through the annual planning process that concluded last month, it was clear that we did need to invest some more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the critical investments.\nSo this is pretty forensic. And when we're looking at transformation, we're looking at technology. We know what our target states need to be, and we know what we need to do to get there and the outcomes they need to be delivering. So we've got our arms around this. And I think you're hearing that confidence from us around we know what we need to do. We know the investments we need to make. We know what the outcomes and the benefits for shareholders and the regulatory side need to be.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, the NII ex Markets outlook, if I just take the Q4 and annualize that, I get to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around 47.4, 47.5, which is above the full-year 2024 level. I'm not sure exactly what modestly means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%. And correct me if you think I'm wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in.\nBut can you just, if you can just comment on how you think, how should we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NII ex Markets? So obviously, there's day count issue in Q1, but maybe how do you think through how we should expect that NII to evolve over the course of the year?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that up modestly, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it. I think I've gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take you through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Cards side of the business and continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits and services.\nWe're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing. We'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset some of the, more than offset, some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment and modestly, let's call it 2% to 3.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Then on the expense outlook at getting below 53 in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past. It does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026, especially in light of continued revenue growth. It's pretty material operating leverage. Just, I mean, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much does severance, how much are we thinking about severance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the legacy stranded costs coming down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026 versus 2025.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. Look, a couple of things. So if you look, as I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been running high with 700, we're forecasting 600 in 2025. I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it 300 or so. And so that gives you some sense for that. I think the other thing is if you look at the other page, and again, there were a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to bring that down. But in the all other page where you look to the right, we show wind downs and what's remaining in terms of legacy franchise. And if you add those numbers together, a billion nine or so of expenses and think about a subset of that being stranded.\nWe're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down stranded cost over the next couple of years. Those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than 53.8% to the 53%. There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made, but those are important factors. As we look at the transformation spend, that'll continue to, or start to pay dividends or help to bring down cost as well.\nYou've got really those four variables that contribute to us bringing that number down. As Jane has mentioned, we're going to, even post 2026, continue to bring or drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund required investments for the business growth, and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60% as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating efficiency.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nHead of US Large Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. This is your first full year of having the five-line-of-business structure. So, Mark, do you still have the same line of business targets that you had last year? And Jane, with all the, it must have been a degree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers of management, expand the span of control. You guys went through a lot last year. I'm just wondering, is the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally, the culture, the sentiment, and how you see that continuing? But first, the concrete question about the targets, please. Thanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we've set the targets across each of the lines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11. And so you'd imagine there's some movement at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets. Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15% if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date.\nBut over time, I expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane mentioned, 10% to 11, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about ROTCE and the strength of these businesses and the aggregate franchise. So hopefully that answers your question.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nChair and CEO, Citi\n\nAnd in terms of org simplification, culture, the best is still ahead. That is for sure. The org went through a lot. I'm really proud of how people responded. I think we're really proud of how each of the lines of business are driving the business performance forward. The bank is simpler. There is tremendous transparency for our investors as well as for me. There's much greater proximity to the businesses now. .\nYou can see that the benefits that we're starting to realize from the strategy as we get closer and closer to the ROTCE targets and beyond for each of the businesses. I am pleased to have 2024 behind us. I'm proud of what we achieved in 2024. All the focus is on the future onward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If there are no further questions, I'll now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\n\nJen Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you, everyone. Please call us or email us if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great afternoon. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Citi Q4 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJenn Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining our Q2 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nThank you, Jenn. Good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me first address the regulatory action by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which were announced on Wednesday.\nThese actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020, and those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech platforms, and automate processes and controls.\nThis week's actions focus primarily on data quality management. We've been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment. As a result, the regulatory action consisted of two civil money penalties, and under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we're allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones, and that is called the Resource Review Plan. We are currently developing the plan for submission to the OCC.\nNow, by way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding company, the OCC is a primary regulator for Citibank, N.A. We call it CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA to continue paying to Citigroup at a minimum the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends, and other non-discretionary obligations. While we're developing and seeking OCC consent for our resource review plan. Dividend amounts above that would require the OCC's non-objection.\nNow these dividends are intercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent Citigroup. They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on Citigroup's ability to pay common dividends to shareholders, nor is there a restriction to buying back shares.\nLet me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our transformation, Citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend from $0.53 to 0.56 a share as we announced in late June, and we will resume modest buybacks in this quarter. While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and for our people. We completely understand that. At the same time we're confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the transformation and we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our transformation and simplifying our firm.\nA multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear, but I can assure you the investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls, and deliver very tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans, automated controls for our traders to reduce errors, move risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure, and increase the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime.\nThe changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial constructs and layers while empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as Vis Raghavan, Tim Ryan, and Andy Sieg.\nYou have my and the entire management team's commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization.\nNow turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium term return targets. We reported net income of $3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall as well as up in each of our five core businesses where all but one had positive operating leverage.\nExpenses were down 2% year over year. The steps we're taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such as Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold even as we increase investment in our transformation over the medium term. We expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive the $2 to 2.5 billion in annual run rate saves. Services grew 3% driven by solid fee growth, which we have prioritized.\nTTS saw increased activity in cross-border payments and in commercial cards. Securities Services was up 10% with new client onboarding, deepening with existing clients, and market valuations helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in depth about how we're going to continue to grow this high-returning business.\nWe're very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel.\nOverall, markets had a strong finish to the quarter, leading to better performance than we'd anticipated. Fixed income was slightly down year on year due to lower FX and rates, but we had good issuance and loan growth in financing and securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37% driven by strong performance in derivatives, which includes the gain on the Visa B exchange offer.\nBanking was up 38% as the wallet rebound gained some momentum, and we again grew share. Our clients continued to access the debt capital markets with investment grade issuance near record levels. Equity issuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment Banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year, and we've seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals year to date, particularly in natural resources and technology. Combined with a strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year and into next year.\nWealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger investment revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is also starting to pay off with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continue to attract top talent from the industry as they focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience.\nUS Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6%, with all three businesses again contributing to the top line. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services, and we continue to see differentiation in the credit segments with the lower-income customers seeing pressure. Retail Banking benefited from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads while delivering strong referrals to Wealth overall.\nWhile we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were pressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly expect USPB's returns to improve from here.\nThe recent stress test again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at 13.6% and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of 1 October. Given the reduction of our stressed capital buffer, our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53.\nDuring the quarter. We returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders, and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We expect to buy back $1 billion in common shares this quarter, and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III Endgame. Looking at the macro environment as we enter the second half of the year, the US is still the world's most structurally sound economy.\nAfter a break in progress. Inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory. Services spending has remained on an upward trend, although there are clear signs of a softening labor market and the tightening of the consumer budget. Of course you might have heard there is an election in November in Europe. While rate cuts have begun, the region's lack of competitiveness continues to be a drag on growth in Asia. China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their pivot to high-tech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semiconductors.\nDespite this uncertainty, as you saw at our Services Investor Day when we went through our performance over the last two years, our business model can produce good results in a wide variety of macro environments and there is plenty of upside for us.\nAcross our five businesses, we have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification both strategically and organizationally. We've completed most of the exits of our international consumer market, we streamlined our organization to catalyze agility and faster decision making, we are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service, and we are automating processes to strengthen controls.\nWe are on a deliberate path. We will continue to execute our transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium term targets and then continue to further improve our returns over time. With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the Q2 unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On slide six we show financial results for the quarter. We reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52, and an RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenue.\nTotal revenues were up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offering. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in equity markets, with the remainder reflected in all other. Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% on a sequential basis.\nThe combination of revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our businesses. Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases and all businesses except USPB where we built for loan growth. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion of total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On slide seven, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters.\nThis quarter, we reported expenses of $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% sequentially, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed by the Fed and OCC earlier this week.\nThe decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification, stranded cost reduction, and lower repositioning costs partially offset by continued investment in transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalties. As we said over the past few months, we will continue to invest in the transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure.\nWe expect these investments to offset some of our saves and headcount reduction going forward. However, based on what we know today, we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money penalty. With that said, we will of course continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter.\nI'd like to also give more color on the transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We've made good progress on our transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement. First, wholesale credit and loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end-to-end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology. This has not only reduced risk, but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience.\nWe've also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessments and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring and in data. While there's a lot more to do, we stood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight through processing. Overall, we've improved risk management and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we're making progress against our transformation milestones.\nThat said, we have fallen short in data quality management, particularly related to regulatory reporting, which we've acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year. As such, we've begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also stress testing capabilities including DFAST and Resolution Recovery.\nWe also reprioritized our efforts to ensure we're focused on data that impact these reports. First, we take this feedback from our regulators very seriously, and we're committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations. Now turning back to the quarterly results on slide nine, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the Q2 net interest income was roughly flat excluding Markets. Net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\nSeasonally lower revolving card balances and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat as growth in cards and Mexico consumer was largely offset by slight declines across businesses, and average deposits decreased by 1% largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to investments in wealth as well as non operational outflows. In TTS.\nOn slide 10 we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework across our card portfolios. Approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to see a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income band.\nWhen we look across our consumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019, and it is the over 740 FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates. Lower FICO band customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates.\nThat said, as we will discuss later, we're seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolio, and we've taken this all into account in our reserving, and we remain well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total card portfolio.\nOur Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade at approximately 82% as of Q2, and we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate nonaccrual loans largely driven by upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions driven by HPI, oil prices, and equity market valuation, and our credit loss reserves continues to incorporate a scenario weighted average unemployment rate of nearly 5% and a downside unemployment rate of nearly 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the current environment.\nTurning to slide 11, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity. It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility.\nOur balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite strategy and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits are corporate at $807 billion and span 90 countries. As you heard at the Services Investor Day, most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable.\nThe majority of our remaining deposits, about $404 billion, are well diversified across the private bank, Citigold, retail, and Wealth at Work offerings as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework.\nOur $688 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and about a third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high quality short duration investment securities that contribute to our approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us to be a source of strength for the industry and, importantly, for our clients. On slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points, or approximately $15 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%.\nWe expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of 1 October, which incorporates the reduction in our stressed capital buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple of weeks ago. We were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That said, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation, or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our capital requirements over time.\nAnd as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB result. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter.\nSo now turning to slide 13, before I get into the businesses. As a reminder, in the Q4 of last year, we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the All Other line for each business in our financial supplement. In Services, revenues were up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and Securities Services.\nNet interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher US and non-US interest rates relative to the prior year period. Non-interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina.\nThe underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investment in product innovation, client experience, and platform modernization that we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense, and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million driven by an ACL release in the quarter.\nAverage loans were up 3%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, particularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate and commercial clients in Latin America and Asia. Average deposits were down 1% driven by non operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we continue to see good operating deposit inflows. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion and Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 23.8% for the quarter.\nOn slide 14 we show the results for Markets for Q2. Markets revenues were up 6%. Fixed Income revenues decreased 3% driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 20% primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and underwriting fees in addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer. We continue to see good underlying momentum in Equity primarily driven by Equity Derivatives and we continue to make progress in prime with balances up approximately 18%.\nExpenses decreased 1% driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss.\nAverage loans increased 11% largely driven by asset-backed lending and Spread Products. Average trading assets increased 12% largely driven by client demand for Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.4 billion with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter. On Slide 15 we show the results for Banking for the Q2.\nBanking revenues increased 38% driven by growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues increased 60% driven by strength across Capital Markets and Advisory, given favorable market conditions. ECM continued to benefit from strong issuance activities mainly in investment grade as issuers continued to de-risk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment.\nIn ECM excluding China A shares, we're seeing a pickup in IPO activity led by the US as well as continued convertible issuance as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. In Advisory, we're seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close both year to date and in the quarter. We gained share across DCM, ECM, and Advisory, particularly in technology where we've been investing.\nCorporate Lending revenues excluding mark to market on loan hedges increased 7% largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased 10% primarily driven by actions taken to rightsize the expense base.\nCost of credit was a benefit of $32 million driven by ACL release, reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit loss. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintained strict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million and RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter. On slide 16 we show the results for Wealth for the Q2. Wealth revenues increased 2% driven by a 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from higher mortgage funding costs.\nWe continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we benefited from double-digit client investment asset growth both in North America and internationally, driven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuation. Expenses were down 4%, driven by the initial benefit of expense reductions as we right-sized the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss.\nPreliminary end-of-period client balances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the transfer of relationships and associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investment on Citi's platform.\nClient investment assets were up 15% driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. Wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter and delivered net income of $210 million with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter. On slide 17 we show the results for US Personal Banking for the Q2. US Personal Banking revenues increased 6% driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments.\nBranded Cards revenues increased 8% driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate and we continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3% primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher. Retail Services revenues increased 6% primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners due to higher net credit losses and interest. Interest-earning balances grew 8%.\nRetail Banking revenues increased 3% driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated positive operating leverage this quarter with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Provision for credit losses increased to $2.3 billion largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million, reflecting volume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things driving our NCLs this quarter.\nFirst, card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NPLs in the Q2.\nThird, certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and higher interest rates resulting in higher losses. However, across both portfolios we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance, but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses.\nDespite these factors, we still expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year and retail services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits decreased 18% as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. Net income was $121 million and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%.\nAs we said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through the regulatory headwinds, lap the credit cycle, and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high-teens return over the medium term. On Slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other, and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items.\nRevenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed exit and wind down and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the impact from the Visa B exchange offer, and expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind downs. Slide 19 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged.\nWe continue to remain laser focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the business's performance, and while we recognize there's a lot more to do on transformation, we are pleased with the progress that we're making towards our 2024 and medium term targets and remain committed to these targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time we will open the floor for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself at any time by pressing star five again. Please limit to one question and one follow up. We'll pause for just a moment.\nOkay, our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, could you elaborate more on the amended consent order? Jane, you said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. A little bit, you know, why it hasn't been resolved and what's on the loss column and maybe a little bit more in the win column too. I mean, you have what, 12,000 people thrown at the problem, billions of dollars, is it? Not enough people is not enough money, is it? Do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language? I mean, you have John Dugan as your lead independent director, ex head of the OCC, and it seems like.\nYou got your report card, I guess you passed overall. They went out of the way to say some nice things, but it looks like you got failing grades in data and regulatory management. So your consent is going to be resolved. But it's already been four years and it hasn't been resolved. So what is it going to take from here and how can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then in the win column since it's so nebulous, this back office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, but you can put more meat on those bones. Thanks.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts of that. So let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we've had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups are allowed to solve problem, the same problem in different ways.\nFragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order. And this is not old Citi putting in band-aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on.\nIt's a multi-year undertaking as we've talked about, and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week.\nWe have made meaningful progress on our transformation.\nExcuse me. On our simplification. Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. And so as Jane says, the progress that we've made spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting. We've got evidence and proof, points of progress against all of those things.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nThank you, Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYes.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nSo, transforming to answer your question about.\nHow do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time? Transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive.\nAt the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance. We're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focus strategy, we've executed the divestitures, we've got a much simpler organization so we can focus on these two priorities. We are able to do both. You can see that in our results again this quarter. Multiple solid proof points on the execution of the strategy, and we know what we need to do on both fronts.\nWe have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy, and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nJust to add a couple of data points to that, Mike, you've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms, we've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to one. We've reduced the six reporting ledgers down to one. 11 sanctioned platforms down to one. So we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years. With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data, regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right? So we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be.\nBut more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently, that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information. So this is an end-to-end process in the way we're approaching it. One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data. That data is; it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures that it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi. Thank you, Mark. I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking US Personal Banking. Heard your comments for credit the rest of this year. And I think a position that you're very conservative reserve, but right now you put up a 3% margin. Credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in the space. I guess my question is as we roll forward in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower, some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here?\nBecause can we be expecting credit costs to come in in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful if USPB obviously marches to where you need it to be.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB.\nWe're looking for that upside in the medium term targets that we've set for ourselves. You got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly, that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L.\nThat's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so we'd expect, and we are, we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now. And so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term.\nAt the same time we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top line. And the combination of those things as we drive towards the medium term will help us to deliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what we've guided to. So it's a combination of top line performance from volume and obviously the environment plays into that. But we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there.\nCost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay, I appreciate all that. One quickie on DCM. You had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about ECM just to make sure that we don't like start modeling listings into perpetuity.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nLook, I think when we think about back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in second half that carry on for a couple of years. But we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first, getting ahead of potential market volatility.\nSo if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative as well as to continued deal deal making, with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on on part of that.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThe only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple of things. So, you know, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market to the direction and volatility of interest rates, the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing. And then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like not just in the US but abroad. And so there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet. But as we said, we believe we're well positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey, good morning. Just Mark, maybe on NII, down almost 4% year over year, seems a little bit more than the guidance, down modestly for the year. So can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, so I'd say a couple of things. So one, as I mentioned in the quarter and if you see it on slide nine, ex Markets, we're down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is is in Argentina we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened, we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the NII line.\nAs I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. So one is going to be rates, right? So as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that'll be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view. The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio. And we do expect to see continued growth, volume growth across certainly the Branded portfolio.\nAnd so that'll be another tailwind for us on the NII line. In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates that'll continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024. Specifically on the non-US side, we still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fees.\nSo, assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact, and it's in the forecast. And then the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half. But again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modest.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nThat's helpful. And maybe just quickly, it's kind of a similar question on expenses better than expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from Q2 run rate. Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYes, so that's right. You know, when I talked about it the Q1, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The Q2 came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance. And that does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in higher than the Q2.\nThat's a combination of a couple of things, including, you know, the pace of hiring and investment that we will do, you know, in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise. Then Q2 did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the Q3 and Q4 around advertising, marketing, and some of the other line items. So yes, the Q3 and Q4, the back half, will be higher than Q2. But consistent with the guidance that I've given.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nHi.\nI had two questions, and I'll ask the first one on expenses first, since it's a good follow up to the previous Mark. Just to clarify, you know, let's just say take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion. Just trying to think about how consensus will move. So we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of FDIC expenses year to date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million. So that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year. Any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nSo yes, the answer, the answer to the last part of your question is yes. So in the range that I've given, $53.5 to 53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the FDIC special assessment we saw earlier in the year, and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nGot it. My second question is for Jane, and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. You're buying back $1 billion. You plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter.\nIt looks like you didn't buy back any in Q2. I'm asking this question in this context because, you know, consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in Q4 and staying at this rate for the first half next year and ramping higher. I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace? Because you didn't buy back any in Q2. I'm fully appreciating. I fully appreciate that you also have, you know, the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification. But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance?\nAlso, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nOkay. So we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly, make a quarterly determination as to the level.\nA lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our stressed capital buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model. Also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out, but with the regulatory changes uncertain.\nThat's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, that's right. On the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2. So Q3, as we talked about, would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter by quarter from here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nThank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Good morning. Mark, regarding the comments you made about, you know, the higher credit losses, the three factors that you, you gave us, can you also talk about if this was a factor at all for you folks? Was there any FICO score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, you know, the fees that you have factored them, you know, the lower fees you factored into your forward look. Where do we stand on that? Do you guys have any color on that as well?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. So on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past the prospect of FICO inflation back during the COVID period of time. You know, we've been very, very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made, you know, have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality, quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have, you know, looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions.\nBut as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have, you know, still continued strong balances and savings.\nAnd it's really the lower FICO band customers where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing. And so the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out. When we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point.\nIn terms of the CFPB late fees, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we built in an assumption.\nIn our forecast, in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Mark. Talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates maybe higher for longer and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curve starting to at least put forth their first cut. I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions. Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as you go forward?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thank you. So look, I think that, you know, as we look at it out through, certainly through the medium term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically. And that's in large part because, or in part, I should say, because of how we've been managing the balance sheet. And that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning. In some instances they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view.\nThe point you make around kind of non US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, you know, that'll play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US, and so we've assumed that we have higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net, net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets combined with.\nThe pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe we'll have continued NII growth. As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis, and you have to remember that that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously across currencies, and in that case the 100 basis points parallel shift downward would be a -$1.6 billion with about $1.3 billion of that coming from non-US dollar.\nBut again that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment, higher yields that we'd be able to earn.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Okay. Just one follow up on the OCC amendment, and that's specifically related to the Resource Review Plan.\nDo you have a line of sight on how long that'll take you guys to finish? Because it seems like. And is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding, like, you know, what this, what the size of what you need to get done in terms of, you know, the other language that's written in the order?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nKen, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that. It's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance with the order. Essentially, if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track, and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today. We obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves. We're already working on the plan after it's finalized with the OCC, though.\nIt will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose. So we won't be able to tell you that.\nThe plan is.\nWhat the nature of the plan is going to be, but won't be much more complicated than what we talked about.\nWe're expecting to get it. We're not expecting this to take long.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good afternoon.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nHi, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, so I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here which is on how we should think about the path of expenses.\nBetween now and the medium term.\nAs we have.\nCome quite a long.\nwe in the simplification process? Maybe you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are and overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here.\nThanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nSo thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So I think we've said it in the past. So the target for the medium term, so think 2026 is somewhere around $51 to 53 billion of expenses.\nAs we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we, that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium term period. And so we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will, you know, have started to generate some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in in business led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 and achieving that range.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nAnd I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium term. And we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. And so.\nWe feel confident around that and good about it. We can manage this.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation related work. You know, the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half. Right.\nWe've done that and we funded that. We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year.\nSo we are managing this entire expense base, so not the whole $53+ billion of it. We are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind, and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are there other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base.\nSo things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies, there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business, things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter, are areas where we've been keenly focused on: where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of?\nSo long-winded way of saying we understand the expense guidance that we've given. We also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required. And we're doing both.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Okay, let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 to 53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order. Am I right there?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nNo, you're not right. So I think, as you've heard us talk about the Vivek.\nFor a while now that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments. Some of that's in people, some of that is in technology spend. It's using different tools and capabilities.\nTo.\nWe got areas addressed earlier. We began that earlier in the year. You saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators, who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that were behind. Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThat's right, Jane. And what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance. Right. And so we have, as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to, and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. So going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nLook, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution. If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind.\nAs we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track. And that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like.\nAnd so what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track. And as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Apologies if I missed in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from Q1 to Q2? It looks like they're down about 6% in aggregate. Even though average loans went up, spending went up. What was the driver of that.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nCredit card revenues?\nSeasonality.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, seasonality\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nSeasonality playing through there\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nsequentially.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, sequentially. Yep.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nIt's.\nI think if you, if you look year over year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in the spend, as Mark referred to, Matt. And a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing in the underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward or across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other. So the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there, but.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nNothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then just separately, on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what can be upstreamed from the bank to the holding company because of the OCC thing that came out this week. For all intents and purposes, does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment. No change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company. But is there any impact from that.\nThat we would notice on the outside? Thank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nLook.\nLet's be clear. This action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parents. So first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will.\nIt's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital, or the liquidity at all. The dividends are not capped.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, yeah. I think, Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there, and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately. Right. So the regulators want essentially the same thing we want. Right. Is for us to get this done. Right. And so that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan. But as Jane mentioned, that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do.\nAs opposed to, it's not a cap. What it is is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividend, and other non-discretionary obligations would require a non-objection.\nFrom the OCC\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nuntil the resource plan is agreed. Until the resource plan, as you'll have seen, the resource plan needs to be submitted within 30 days. As I indicated, you know, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just want to follow up on the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection to before dividending upstream to the parent that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about.\nYou know, it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from, for example, a Basel Endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So you don't see this impacting your ongoing level capital flexibility and your ability to.\nRepurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nNo.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nIs that right? Okay.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nNo, I don't.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nThat was as clear as can be. Good. Thank you. Second question on, I just want to follow up on USPB. I mean I still.\nYou know, I get the point.\nThat, you know, you're seeing normalization in losses and cards. But you know, even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single digits. I would think even at these NCO levels your cards business is pretty profitable. Your scale player when you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels. But not, I don't know if it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount. It would seem to imply that the retail bank is a huge drag on profitability, maybe even losing money, I don't know.\nBut can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the retail bank profitability and just give any more color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teens RoTCE you talked about?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, let me, let me kick off there and say, look, clearly we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get us to the high teens level over the medium term. And you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth, and as Mark said, however, we're at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about.\nBut as the NCL rates approach steady state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm-wide medium-term targets in the Retail Bank.\nWe're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that leveraging our physical and digital assets. It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we're looking at in our wealth franchise. We're continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the retail bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle. It's driving the low point for USPB. As I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good afternoon. So Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilization and specifically the NOLs. The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap. And the good news here I suppose is that it should come back into capital over time. But we've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so wanted to better understand is what's constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs and are there catalysts on the horizon that can actually help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYep. Thank you. So I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes down to driving US income. Right. And so we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US that allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We saw some of that in the quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term. But that is the major.\nDriver of that utilization.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nAnd we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that this is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities in the commercial bank. We see it in wealth, we see it obviously in US Personal Banking and in services. So we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just from the financial side.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you both for that color. Maybe just a quick follow up. Just on the Retail Services business, we are seeing some evidence that your competitors in the space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. And is there something you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitors' space and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nWell, I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So when we, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their.\nPortfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things. And it's a shift probably from some of the ways in the past. But I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThat may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space. As Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return that's part of achieving our medium-term targets. As you know, since you brought up Retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works and the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet, where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. It's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nMark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right return and being very disciplined around that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, sorry. Just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane, what do you think this does in terms of timing? How much longer.\nFor you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nLook, in terms of the consent order.\nThe areas, we've had delays. There are four areas to the consent order. It is risk management, it's data governance is around compliance, and it's around controls.\nAs we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data.\nWe've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting. So we added some more bodies of work there, and we're well underway. We are not expecting this to extend the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order. We have a target state for the different areas of it.\nWe have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly but as robustly as possible. We're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than what I would call the old Citi way, which is a series of band-aids that remediate but don't actually fix the underlying issue.\nThat way we are delivering for our shareholders, as well as our regulators, and our clients because we're putting in.\nWe're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all. But I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Just two clarifications. So.\nThis is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. I think what I hear you saying, but if you can confirm, your risk, compliance, and controls are getting passing grades. It's really the data and, as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which have 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, Mike. Maybe you're asking a great question, and it's an important question. So maybe I try and explain the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, as you heard about at our Services Investor Day, access, you know, account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect. And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms.\nWe can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems. But what is the transformation doing?\nWhat it is doing is simplifying how data moves through firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure. So what are we doing? We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about this smart system, make sure there's no errors when we book a trade.\nWe've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories. They're the golden sources, an in-person data hub, which you've heard me talk about a few times. And they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use populating.\nThe thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about, and other areas, and what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place to govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically. Mark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure.\nYou've heard us talk about a single full suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we have had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows. So instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So it's a.\nSorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it's important to understand what it is because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of tactical fixes.\nWhere we're behind. As we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address than we knew back when we did the plan. We've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports. And we increase the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned.\nSo what we're doing, we're adding resources and data experts, we're learning from best practices, and we're using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much quickly. We're also.\nTo some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots. How do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner? So all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies, and hope at the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm that is the data plan.\nClearly there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're investing. We've already begun that investment as Mark and I have talked about, to get it done. We'll get it done.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nReal short fault.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nAll right. What was that?\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nI was just going to say real short. Follow up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short just in like one sentence. Despite doing all this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said you didn't get it done. Or why after doing all that, didn't you get it done in the eyes of the regulators? And why will it be fixed now? Just like a one sentence explanation for that if you have it.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nI always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward, we have setbacks, we adjust, we learn from them, we move forward, and we get back on track.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nMike, if I could just put one number into context because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape, here there are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators. A lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.\n\nJenn Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citi\n\nThank you all for joining us. Please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Citi's Q2 2024 earnings call.

This call is.\nHello and welcome to Citi's Q4 2023 Earnings Call. Today's call will be hosted by Jenn Landis, Head of Citi's Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJenn Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citi\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining our Q4 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser and our Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com\nMay contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nThank you, Jenn. A very happy new year to everyone, and I hope you all had a good break. At Citi, we're back at it, and given the notable items and our new financial reporting structure, we've got a lot to cover today. So I'm going to get right to it. 2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said, the Q4 was clearly very disappointing.\nToday I'm going to provide a high level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results, and finish with our priorities for 2024. We know that 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our medium term target and our transformation. So turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy, as you can see on slide five, in 2023 we saw a record year for Services where we maintained our number one ranking among large institutions in TTS. With client wins up 27% and a sustained win-loss rate above 80%, we've now gained over 100 basis points in share in Securities Services since 2021. In Wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion US dollars in net new assets during the year.\nIn USPB, we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, and we began to see the early fruits of our investments in key talent in Banking. In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance. You can now see in our financials the full year returns and P&L by business. While they are all impacted by investments and transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of Q1 and will result in over $1 billion US dollars of run rate saves from the net elimination of approximately 5,000 roles, mainly managers.\nAs Mark will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expenses in 2024 over the medium term between simplification benefits of the transformation, stranded costs, and other productivity efforts. We expect to eliminate 20,000 positions ex Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion US dollars in run rate saves. Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client focused and less bureaucratic. Realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium term revenue targets. With this new structure, I'm holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer act to ensure we're disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients.\nWe have now completed the divestitures of nine of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound down nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea, and China. We've restarted the sales process in Poland and are well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We're exiting marginal businesses such as munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths and allocate our capital with rigor now. Without doubt, all these changes are difficult. They are necessary. At the same time, we continue to invest in our transformation, risk and control environment, and data architecture, and we were pleased to have closed the FX Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We're committed to fulfilling the expectations of our regulators given the unique role we play in the global financial system.\nThe modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace, allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year, we consolidated trading and reporting platforms and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second year in a row.\nThese enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses such as hiring commercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our global network, and automating processes for our Securities Services clients. It was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires including Andy Sieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues. We're feeling empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders. While Mark will go through the details, I'd like to level set on our disappointing Q4 before recapping the full year's results. Earlier this week, we disclosed additional external headwinds, some of which materialized in the second half of December, including a $1.3 billion US dollars reserve build related to transfer risk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia.\nWe also saw a nearly $900 million US dollars negative revenue impact as a result of the larger than expected devaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion US dollars FDIC assessment, drove this quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16 US dollars. Now, while these items are clearly very painful, they are quite idiosyncratic in nature and will not impact the course we have set in terms of the performance of our five businesses. While Services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation, the underlying growth remains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, Services revenues were up 16% for the full year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation in TTS; cross-border transactions were up 15%, and AUC/AUA in Securities Services were up by close to $3 trillion US dollars for the year.\nIn Markets, our fixed income results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December, particularly in rates and FX. Markets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation.\nThis franchise is well positioned with our corporate clients, and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to high returning products or exiting products which aren't a strategic fit. We had a decent quarter in equities, particularly in derivatives, and we saw growth in prime balances, an area we have been focusing on. While activity picked up in Q4, with revenues up 22%. Overall Banking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet. Globally, Investment Banking was up slightly for the year, and we finished 2023 as the fifth leading franchise. We certainly aspire to be better. We're seeing improved confidence among CEOs, and we like our pipeline, but of course the timing for a robust recovery is uncertain. The share gains we've made in areas such as healthcare put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively.\nWhile investment activity in Asia rebounded, with quarterly revenues up 21% and Wealth at work up 18% for the year, overall Wealth revenues were down in 2023, and we fully recognize that this business isn't where it needs to be. Andy is off to a fast start. In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet, he's tightening our focus to build fee-based revenue streams and investment AUM. With 100 trillion in new Wealth to be created by 2030 mainly in North America and Asia, and with our clients holding $5.4 trillion US dollars away from us, we have an important ability here to drive growth and returned to where they should be. USPB was a bright spot with every product up double digits in the quarter compared to last year, including retail banking which benefited from a rebound in mortgage origination.\nNew and refreshed products have increased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments we've made, and in card, IEB and ANR continued their growth, reflecting a more balanced lend versus spend mix and falling payment rates. As expected, loss rates are now back to pre-pandemic levels driven by customers in the lower FICO band. In terms of the full year in 2023, we grew revenues ex divestitures by 4%. Although the Argentine devaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the $78 billion US dollars revenue mark, we met our full year expense guidance, and we increased our CET1 ratio to 13.3% during the year. We grew our tangible book value per share by 6% to $86.19 US dollars, and we returned $6 billion US dollars in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends, and share buybacks.\nWe remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically, and I'm very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally with the US well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and diligent risk management, we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to pass. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths.\nGiven how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures, 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation. I recognize the importance of this year, and I am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions we've taken through the momentum of our businesses. Backed by investments in key products, we believe we can continue to grow revenues ex divestitures by 4% to 5 over the medium term. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environment to reach our medium term return target and return capital to our shareholders while continuing the investments needed in our transformation. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the Q4 and full year firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons. Unless I indicate otherwise, I'll also focus on our guidance for 2024 and end with the path to our medium term return target. The presentation of our results reflects the changes we've made in conjunction with our organizational simplification, including reporting legacy franchises and corporate other in All Other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8-K we recently filed. At the top right of slide seven, we show these items on a pre-tax basis. The FDIC special assessment of approximately $1.7 billion US dollars related to regional bank failures in March.\nThis impacted expenses and All Other. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million US dollars related to actions associated with our organizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium term. Impacted expenses in All Other. The impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately $880 million US dollars. This was recorded in non-interest revenue across Services, Markets, and Banking, and you can see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation. While we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefited from high interest rates, earning approximately $250 million US dollars of NII on the net investment in the quarter. Given the hyperinflationary environment and a reserve build of $1.3 billion US dollars related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures to Russia and Argentina, as described in the 8-K.\nThis impact is mostly included in other provisions and cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination of these items negatively impacted dollar diluted EPS by approximately $2 US dollars and ROTCE by approximately 920 basis points. Now turning to the left side of the slide where we show our financial results for the full year. In the Q4 we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion US dollars and a net loss per share of $1.16 US dollars on $17.4 billion US dollars of revenue. Excluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 US dollars with an ROTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In the quarter total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis excluding divestiture-related impacts and the impact of the Argentina devaluation.\nRevenues increased 2%, driven by strength across Services, USPB, and Investment Banking, partially offset by lower revenues in Markets and Wealth, and the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind downs. Turning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16 billion US dollars, which include the FDIC special assessment and modest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion US dollars, largely driven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion US dollars, excluding the reserve build for transfer risk. Cost of credit was primarily driven by card net credit losses, which are now at pre-COVID levels, as well as ACL builds for new card volume.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion US dollars in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%, and on a full-year basis, we delivered $9.2 billion US dollars of net income and an ROTCE of 4.9%. Adjusting for the notable item, net income was approximately $13.1 billion US dollars with an ROTCE of 7.3%. On slide eight, we show full-year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority of the financing and securitization business from Banking to Markets. We also implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking and between Banking, Services, and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our historical financials.\nNow looking at the full year numbers, Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion US dollars up 16%, benefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins, and deepening with existing clients partially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion US dollars largely driven by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The Markets business was also impacted by the Argentina devaluation. Banking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion US dollars primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges as well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment Banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as we gained share amidst the declining wallet. Corporate lending revenues were down 4% excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion US dollars primarily due to the deposit mix shift towards higher yielding products which drove lower deposit spreads.\nUSPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion US dollars, primarily driven by growth in card balances as we continue to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisition and customer engagement. Total revenues excluding divestitures came in at $77.1 billion US dollars, below our guidance of $78 to 79 billion US dollars for the year, largely due to the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer markets performance particularly in December, and losses on loan hedges. However, NII ex-Markets came in at $47.6 billion US dollars in line with our guidance. Despite the challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firm-wide revenues by approximately 4% ex divestitures in line with our Investor Day target, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model and the investments we've been making. On slide nine, we show full-year expense trends from 2021 to 2023 excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts.\nFull-year expenses were $54.3 billion US dollars for 2023, in line with our guidance. As I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million US dollars of restructuring costs associated with our organizational simplification, and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million US dollars, which included actions to address stranded costs and start to right-size the businesses relative to the prior year. Expense growth continued to be driven by transformation and business-led investments, volume-related expenses, and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses in legacy franchises within All Other. Over the past few years, we've been investing across these themes, which has not only impacted the performance of the firm but also the businesses. On slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023.\nOver the past three years we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes, and data. As you can see in the bar chart at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our transformation investments are in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees, and consultants. In 2023, we've seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology, and compensation as we've gotten deeper into the execution of our transformation, and you should expect to see this trend continue. In total, we invested over $12 billion US dollars in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are also focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements, and areas that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber. On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics across Branded Cards and Retail Services.\nApproximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher, and across both portfolios NCL rates have reached pre-COVID levels, but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 7.7% in our corporate portfolio. The majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 63 basis points of total corporate loans. We feel good about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment. As it relates to Argentina, we've included a slide in the appendix summarizing the value it brings to the global network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold, as well as the strength of our financial profile in Argentina. As it relates to Russia, we've also included a slide in the appendix.\nYou will see that the reserves for transfer risks that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment and therefore our risk of loss related to Russia. On slide 12 we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion US dollars balance sheet which is funded in part by a well diversified $1.3 trillion US dollars deposit base which is deployed into high quality diversified assets. The majority of our deposits, $801 billion US dollars, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion US dollars of US Personal Banking and Wealth deposits. We have approximately $561 billion US dollars of HQLA and approximately $690 billion US dollars of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of $965 billion US dollars. Our LCR decreased modestly to 116% and our tangible book value per share was $86.19 US dollars, up 6%.\nOn the bottom left corner of the slide we show a full CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in 2023. First, we generated $8 billion US dollars of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we returned $6.1 billion US dollars in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 53 basis points. Third, we benefited from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, which drove an increase of 20 basis points. Finally, the remaining 3 basis points was largely driven by higher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%.\nAs you can see, we've grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year while returning over $6 billion US dollars to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases. Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we're not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses, and therefore we are laser focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying the organization, and right sizing the expense base. As a reminder, the investments that we've been making have impacted each of the businesses, as you will see in the next few slides. Now turning to slide 13 where we show the results for Services for the Q4 and the full year. Revenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and Securities Services, partially offset by NIR driven by the Argentina devaluation.\nServices non-interest revenues were up 20% excluding the impact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, product innovation, and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million US dollars, driven by a reserve build of approximately $652 million US dollars, primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net income decreased to $776 million US dollars as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans and TTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisition and deepening with existing clients. However, sequentially, deposits were up 1%.\nServices delivered an ROTCE of 13.4% for the quarter, and for the full year, Services delivered an ROTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion US dollars of revenue. On slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the Q4 and the full year. Markets revenues were down 19% versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the devaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased by 25%, largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December, as well as the impact of devaluation. However, we saw good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 9%, driven by gains across all products, and we continue to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target.\nExpenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation, risk and controls, and volume-related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209 million US dollars, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million US dollars, primarily associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million US dollars, as revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion US dollars, as we saw increased client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to $391 billion US dollars, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in fixed income for much of the year.\nWhile it was a challenging quarter, Markets performed relatively well for the full year with revenue of $18.9 billion US dollars and an ROTCE of 7.4% compared with very strong performance in the prior year, and we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth, expense discipline, and capital optimization. On slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the Q4 and the full year. Banking revenues increased 22% driven by growth in Investment Banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially offset by lower corporate lending revenue. Investment Banking revenues increased 27% year-over-year, driven by DCM and Advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In Advisory, we saw signs of strength across technology, health care, and energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline.\nCorporate lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share from Investment Banking, Services, and Markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly flat. Cost of credit was $185 million US dollars, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk. In Russia and Argentina, the NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million US dollars as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset higher revenues. ROTCE was -6% for the quarter, and for the full year, banking reported an ROTCE of -0.2% on $4.6 billion US dollars of revenue. Clearly, we have more work to do on returns.\nWhile it's difficult to predict when activity will normalize, we're positioning the business to capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet. That includes continuing to invest in key growth areas, upgrading talent in traditional sectors, and continuing to right size the business. On slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the Q4 and the full year. Wealth revenues decreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding costs and higher investment fee revenues. We're seeing good momentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 13% in the Q4, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity, and market performance. Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by repacing strategic investments and tighter expense control.\nAs we begin to right size the expense base in the business, Wealth reported a net income of $5 million US dollars as revenues were mostly offset by higher expenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit balance. Average loans were flat as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuation. We're seeing good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled to $16 billion US dollars for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion US dollars in net new assets. ROTCE was 0.1% for the quarter, and for the full year, ROTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion US dollars of revenue.\nLooking ahead, we're going to improve the returns in the business as we invest in talent to execute on our refocused strategy to drive investment revenue, with an eye towards right sizing the expense base. We will wind down non-core initiatives, exit less productive performers, and enhance discipline across every expense loss. On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the Q4 and the full year. US Personal Banking revenues increased 12%. Branded Cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balances growth of 13%, and we continue to see healthy growth in new account acquisitions, up 8%, and spend volumes, up 3%. Retail Services revenues increased 15%, also driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11%, as well as lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses.\nRetail banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth, and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1%, as higher expenses to support lending programs and client engagement, as well as the rollout of simplified banking, were offset by lower non-volume-related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion US dollars increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially offset by a lower ACL bill. Net income increased to $201 million US dollars, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. We continue to make progress against our digital strategy, with digital deposits of 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. ROTCE for the quarter was 3.6%, and for the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an ROTCE of 8.3% on $19.2 billion US dollars of revenue.\nHere again we are focused on improving the return profile of the business, managing through this part of the credit cycle, and continuing to make progress in retail banking will be key. On slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes corporate, other, and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture related items.\nRevenues decreased 17% driven by a decrease in NII of 29% driven by the closed exits in wind down, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue, and expenses increased to $4.5 billion US dollars driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower expenses in both wind down and exit markets. Turning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewhat uncertain and markets remain difficult to predict. Based on what we see today, we expect revenues to be approximately $80 to 81 billion US dollars as shown on the left side of the slide. On the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers in TTS. We expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients, and continued momentum with commercial clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product innovation in Securities Services.\nWe have a very healthy pipeline and will continue to onboard assets under custody from new mandates, win new clients, and deepen relationships with existing clients. In Investment Banking, we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers over time. We do expect the investments that we've made in key growth areas such as healthcare and technology to allow us to gain share, and we also expect a modest rebound in Wealth as we execute on our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients. In USPB, we expect continued growth in card balances driven by the investments we've been making, as well as lower partner payments in Retail Services to continue to drive revenue growth.\nWe also expect to continue to improve our retail branch performance, and as it relates to NII excluding markets, we expect net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more than offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to slide 21, we expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 to 53.8 billion US dollars, down from $54.3 billion US dollars, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind downs, and productivity savings, partially offset by investments in risk and controls, and volume-related expenses. Embedded in this guidance includes an elevated level of severance as well as additional potential costs related to the organizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to 1 billion US dollars.\nThis will contribute to reducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide. On slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium term. As we've discussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses: organizational simplification, including the reduction of management layers; eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets; and realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our headcount by a net 20,000, excluding Mexico, and generate a net run rate save of $2 to 2.5 billion US dollars over the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 to 53 billion US dollars of expenses, subject to volume-related expenses.\nBoth the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right size the firm and businesses to improve performance and return. On slide 23, we show our outlook for US cards in 2024 in terms of credit performance. Based on the trends that we're seeing, we expect NCL rates both in Branded Cards and Retail Services portfolios to rise above pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024 on a full-year basis. For 2024, we expect the Branded Cards NCL rate to be in the range of 3.5% to 4, and the Retail Services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25. From an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted eight-quarter average unemployment rate of almost 5%, which embeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%.\nACL bills in 2024 will primarily be a function of the volume growth that we see, as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the probabilities associated with them. We expect continued momentum in cards, albeit more in line with mid single-digit loan growth. On slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. From a revenue perspective, we continue to expect 4% to 5 revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits and the wind down. From an expense perspective, we're now on the path to lowering our expenses beginning in 2024. From a credit perspective, we expect credit costs to be a function of portfolio mix, volumes, and macro assumptions.\nWe are committed to returning capital to our shareholders and in fact expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the Q1 of 2024. To wrap it up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our 11% to 12 ROTCE in the medium term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will open the floor for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself at any time by pressing star five again. Please note you'll be allowed one question and one follow-up question. Again, that is star five to ask a question. We'll just pause for a moment.\nOkay. Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst and Managing Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi.\nI looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide four, and I think the question is on many people's minds. I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup and I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12. It could be 5, it could be 8, could be 12, it could be more. I have not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. The question is, why is this time different? Number one, you know, who is this new and improved Citigroup? Number two, why aren't expenses down even more, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target? Three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12 ROTCE in 2025 or 2026? Thank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nWell, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with who is Citi? Citi is, I'm delighted to say, finally, simple Investor Day. You know, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients across borders. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set out on a deliberate path to get there, and over the last three years we've done so. Page four is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses, no more, no less. We have our organization that now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses so that we can meet the medium-term ROTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be.\nI need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year. Mike, I, and the management team are accountable to deliver, and that you and our investors have the transparency you need to hold us accountable. So why is this time different?\nLook, it's not lost on me that there have been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term, and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. You've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions, and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simpler Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy, so we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model. We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen, we've moved quickly.\nWe're on track with our execution of this effort, and it will generate over $1 billion US dollars of run-rate savings by the end of Q1 purely from the organizational efforts that we've put in that we announced in September. We've done this while investing, and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation, and while that was catalyzed by our Consent Orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation, from well-governed data, from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support 4% to 5 revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through the client organization. We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas including Andy to lead Wealth.\nAnd we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So we are doing things the right way. We're doing it for the long term, and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to to address our regulatory requirements. But that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12 ROTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize 2024 is a critical year, and as I said, the decks are much clearer now so that we can focus on two imperatives, improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that we have to build our credibility.\nWe're committed to doing so and we are providing far more transparency around the business performance so investors have a better sense of how we're doing. I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done. We will. Mark, expenses?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise both on the front end and importantly on the transformation, the risk, and controls. What I would point out is that in 2023 we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion US dollars ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I'd also highlight that we also included $780 million US dollars associated with the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification cost so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion.\nThat means spending what we need to spend on the transformation, risk, and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12. And to your point, if revenues are to come down or come in lower than expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi. Thanks very much. So you're clearly making a lot of progress, and I hate to like ask this question squarely, but I think it is important. Your expense guy is good, your revenue guy's good, and you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments. Because if you look around the world, there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be your branch network, or Wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investment. So how do you, how do we know that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the good ways that you've been doing?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, thanks. I guess I'll start. And Jane, feel free to add in on it.\nLook, it is a balance in that. Right. And we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where the return opportunities associated with them and how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations. And we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back.\nAnd that's what you've seen over the past year plus is that we've been investing in the business where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated. We dialed back that spend, right. And that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this, we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we've invested in health care, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive. So it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nI appreciate that. Maybe a quickie on Services, obviously up 16% in a record is great. I don't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core business momentum and a pipeline of one, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is where can Services be over, let's say the next two years in terms of growth while rates come down yet your business is winning new wins.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, sure. Want me to.\nSure.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah. And I'll jump in too. Let's maybe start with TTS.\nWhen we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex Argentina came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. You can see that in the different drivers. Cross border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we generated 22% in average revenue growth from 2021 to 2023, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high single-digit. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped, and we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid single-digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rates increases. That's going to come from a few different areas.\nOne, the focus on our fee strategy where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high quality deposits. And in a low rate environment GDP is typically higher. So you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital efficient payment volumes. You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I point to our confidence here: 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win loss ratio of 82% on new deals. And that was across different client segments, and revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them.\nAnd you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products, and we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done: Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, etc. So I think the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities. So we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down, and it is a crown jewel for a reason. And then just quickly on Securities Services, I think where we're seeing, we mentioned we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers.\nAnd one of the core strategies that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We had a very low; we were at 2.6% share in 2020. We're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming not only from our global network names, but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. And I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients. Mark, anything I've missed there?\nYou know I love this business.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nAs you said, right. This is a high returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth we could attribute to interest rates and about half I'd say is business action. So us working with, you know, the clients to drive that momentum and then if you think about the non-interest revenue for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter, year-over-year, if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation, and up 7% on a full year basis. So good momentum in the non-interest revenue.\nGrowth as well.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, good morning. Mark, I was hoping to ask you how you're thinking about the pacing of capital build. Obviously the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change. Of course even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phased phase-ins and perhaps in mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital given all those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nSure. So look John, obviously the Basel III proposal still out there and under discussion, we've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year.\nWe're going to continue to do that. We obviously generate earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business. We're trading at a, you know, 0.5x book when we can, we want to buy back as much as we can in shares, and we try to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters. Doing that at a modest level. You heard me saying, you heard me say we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level. But we're going to be, we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like, and we're actively working on what mitigation actions we'd have to put in place, you know, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits.\nSo it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs with obviously holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buybacks where we can do that.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked? You know, when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year, and are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and control. And so we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024, and if we've got to spend, you know, a bit more than what we spent this year, we're going to spend more.\nThat's what the plan calls for. And so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance. Right. And so that is, that's important for us. I think it will drive obviously operational improvement and savings down the line. It is part of the $2 to 2.5 billion US dollars. But that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so I would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been making and transformation and risk and controls.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, I think Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multi-year journey as we've always been clear around this, ultimately with benefits for the shareholders, and more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are a separate out transformation from the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is as profound, productive, and as effective as possible. And the types of benefits we're seeing. This is the second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base, and you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms onto 1, 6 reporting ledgers onto 1, 11 sanction platforms onto 1.\nSo we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in. Other things we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business. We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories. That will also begin to start having some benefits for us. So there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work we've done. But it will take some time to really kick in, too, as Mark said, when you really feel it is a few years out. But we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going. So it's not just trust us, this is coming. You'll begin to see it build.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey, good afternoon. You know, Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, you know, slide 22 where you talk about $2 to 2.5 billion US dollars of expense saves. I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you look at exit and wind down markets, you're probably close to $2 billion US dollars in numbers there. And maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all of that out. You're doing about severance is $700 million to $1 billion US dollars in 2024. So it doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number. And just maybe I'm wrong. If you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's, you kind of alluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nI think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things. One, obviously we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time, and so there's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time. And so what you see is there's an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things, and that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks.\nAnd so it's important to think about their headwinds and tailwinds. That kind of nets down to this $2 to 2.5 billion US dollars. And then the final point that I'd make is if I look at this medium-term number of $51 to 53 billion US dollars, that still has Mexico in it. And in one of the other pages, we point to expenses around Mexico, but because of where we are in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base. And so you can't lose sight of that.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nWell, that's an important clarification that the $2 to 2.5 billion US dollars includes some revenue-related volume growth. So that's helpful. And then just maybe the other on the slides talking about revenue targets, one of the big numbers not talked about was Markets. How are you thinking volatility has come in? Macro pictures getting better.\nMaybe that mutes volatility. How do you think about that business in 2024 as it relates to your guidance?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nAs you know, it's a tough business to forecast certainly for a full year and in some instances for a quarter. And so we basically kind of backed that out, but we've assumed Markets kind of flat to, you know, modestly, modestly down. But we, we've backed it out and it's roughly flat.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nRight. Okay.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nNot of the $81 billion US dollars, not of the $80 to 81 billion US dollars, but you see the guidance of NIR ex-Markets and NII ex-Markets. So in the, in the $80 to 81 billion US dollars we've assumed it roughly flat.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good afternoon.\nI think just one.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nHi, Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nMorning.\nAfternoon.\nJane, just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around. It's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro. Should we take it based on what you said today, as we look into 2026 getting to that 11% ROTCE if for whatever reason revenue falls short, you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nIt's Jane. Obviously, I want to just jump in on one bit, which is we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5 revenue growth rate. So there isn't any backing away from that number. And that's in various macro environments, so etc. And as we look across the different businesses and the projections we have, we're confident around that.\nObviously if there's a very adverse macro environment, etc., we've got other levers we can take. But Mark, let me pass it to you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah. And by no means was I trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top line. You think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses. We've got a lot of conviction around that. With that said, as you point out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out there, obviously volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like, that would naturally come down. We'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall, and then we'd recalibrate other spend, other investments, spend not related to risk and control, the transformation, but other investments across the platform. We recalibrate accordingly.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nPerfect.\nJust what I needed. And one quick question as we think about right-sizing the Markets business, there've been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that you've gotten out.\nIs there a risk where the Markets business becomes too small and you lack the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant and certain just across the breadth of, be it fixed income or equities. Just. If you can talk about that.\nThank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nThe short answer is no.\nIf you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses each of which are around four billion or so in size. You have our global FX network where we're typically number one in any year, just given the strength and particularly the corporate client base. We sit atop rates, typically top three. Together these are two of the largest macro pools within FX in terms of the spread products. We've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification fully within Markets so that we've created a unified scaled spread product business, and then finally equities where we're focused on improving our prime offering building balances. We have a way to go obviously in that prime balances were pleased; they were nicely up this year driven by by client momentum, and we're a leading equity derivatives franchise. So you do have these four core businesses.\nI go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well positioned. We have a very differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS and Banking, and that, and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities, and in rates around the world. So Markets is important both in terms of its leadership but also how it fits into the strengths that we have. From this simplicity of those five core interconnected businesses, we've demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future. And you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting onto RWA, 5.3%, getting close to that target. We said Investor Day, we're moving that up to 6%.\nThe exits we've got of non-strategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency. And we've also been doing some good investments in our technology that's getting us into a good place there. So I think.\nDon't be concerned about this shrinking. We're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGood afternoon, Mark and Jane.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nGreat.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nMark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide in the net interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower, and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast, which includes, for the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate environment? I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, I think what I point you to is in the range of the $81 billion US dollars, the $80 to 81 billion US dollars, you know, we're assuming three to six cuts, right? You got a range there.\nThe reason I describe it that like that, excuse me, is that if you think about our IRE as we've shown it in the Q's before, we're positioned such that, you know, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars. Right. So to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars. So as we think about that forecast and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers, you know, kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely, you know, backloaded, but that's what's in there.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good, I appreciate that.\nThen Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative, but obviously there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on: exiting businesses, downsizing businesses, especially in the downsizing. I think you guys mentioned the headcount, about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough, tough decisions that you all have to make?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYep.\nWell, we've also got areas which are growing, so that does help too. It's the, we have a diversity portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of that. There is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect, and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question, Jane. When will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just Q4? I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis points buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III Endgame is still out there. And I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your or being mindful of your RWA footprint and given where your stock is relative to book, when will we be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer term outlook that was underpinning your ROTCE target with regards to the buyback?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nErika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up because given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous, and Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility, and I don't want to say things we're not going to deliver against or that we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly, and with the NPR, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended, and we want to see what that is.\nI think you've all heard us at the Senate Banking hearings with our concerns about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy, the US banking system, competitiveness, and the move of more business to the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point which is not healthy. So we're going to wait and see before where that comes out before we give it to you. But I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility, because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous, was that sort of awareness. I think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors. So thank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. I want to follow up on the Russia exposure on page 34. Looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the debt investment. And you also highlight how the CTA would be capital neutral even if you've been able to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure? And just, like, how are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate dividends? I just don't. I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure. And is there a risk to you going forward or did you hopefully de-risk that outside exposure going forward?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah.\nAnd actually.\nI also want to kind of take a bigger picture onto that before I turn it to Mark, because I would have thought there's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about.\nWhat we've been doing with Russia and Argentina. So the biggest strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to your specifics on the Russia front. If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So that means we hold long-term capital in those countries upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. I think we just point to our leading Services and FX businesses: are the heart of that network, and they're generating double digits as you can see. With that footprint comes a set of risks. I think of them in terms of credit, currency, and transferability of capital, and we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time.\nWith respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say Russia is rather unique. It's a war, and for us a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved again. I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute because I'm sure folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years we derisked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank. So we've really reduced down our emerging market exposures to just our institutional presence focused on the multinational clients. You've heard us talk about that.\nSelect high-grade local clients. Just look at Argentina. It's a very good business for us over the cycle. Even after the impacts of Q4, we had less than $5 million US dollars in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable. $5 million US dollars over 10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues, the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We were able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure. But we would certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did, mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. The reserve is a reserve. It centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking rules. So I just want to put part of things of this quarter into that context. We have a global business model.\nIt's heavily focused on high grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and reserve profile. Mark, what would you add?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nVery quickly on the Russia point. As you know and as the slide points out, we've continued to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion US dollars. It's down 13% from the previous year and 1/3 from 2021. You know, we brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way there. Essentially what's left is that we have a custody business and we are holding corporate dividends that are our clients proceeds. We're unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold those. That's what's being referenced in the slide where we say unremittable Russia, corporate dividends. So that, that is not a risk of loss for us. But we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, that was clear. Then just separately in credit card, you know, you and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here, but most seem to be saying they're going to peak this year, including you. And just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year? Is it just getting back to that, you know, a little bit above normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? You know, what's driving that confidence looking out this year? Because it's obviously a step upcoming still?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nSure, there is a step upcoming. We give a forecast on 2023, as you point out, to what the full year estimate for NCLs will be for both Branded and for Retail Services.\nWhat I'd point out is you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. So to some extent what we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in a cards portfolio. On top of that, we've been originating new card. You've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously have new card loans and those are going through a much more normal maturation period. So as we look at kind of the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level. We think they'll peak inside of 2024. That's what's captured in that average forecast that we've given.\nWe haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens. Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come onto our portfolio and are in the mix of our Branded portfolio as well. And so anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that we're talking about here.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nRyan Kenny\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a question on quantitative tightening. Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi's positioned if the Fed ends QT early, is that a material catalyst for you, and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah, again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure and for US dollar in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q for 100 basis points move and a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a -$1.6 billion US dollars or so.\nBut important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral, again assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so, you know, we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and therefore the impact there.\n\nRyan Kenny\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThere's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing that? Can you help us update us on Investment Banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, and DCM?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYeah, we certainly had a much more constructive market environment at the end of 2023. Interest rate spreads and volatility at lows of the year. Equity prices are high, and I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in 2024, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, and the quality of it is very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward. And we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this. And when we're looking at our own side, as you know, we've been investing in some higher growth areas, so we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high growth areas.\nWe've been seeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology, as well as areas of traditional strength such as energy and industrials. I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM, the beginnings of one in LevFin, and so.\nCautiously optimistic here.\nI wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nNo. I completely agree.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nAfternoon everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess just broadly, how might that be embedded in the 2024 revenue guidance? And I guess just at a top level maybe just a thought or two on.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out the revenue in attrition.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. Just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction in force over the coming year?\nHow that?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nNo, no, we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplifications. So the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles, and they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators. And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward. So I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency while preserving our front line and encouraging them to be as revenue productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I'd like to see the opposite, actually.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, perfect. Thank you. And then, Mark, could you discuss for a second maybe just broadly the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline toward the end, but you know what, what happens between now and then? Do they hold kind of, kind of flattish with a core rate or would there be any normal course of business growth?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nI think what I'd say is that you should expect that in the Q1 we'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth. In part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and therefore dollars associated with that in Q1. And then from there I would expect that you see a downward trend through the Q4.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. All right, thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nHi.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nHi, Vivek.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nCouple of quick clarifications on your NII guide you talked about. You're assuming three to six cuts. That's us, I presume. So are you assuming unchanged rates outside the US since you have more sensitivity outside?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nModest declines outside, but yes, declines outside as well, but not nearly at the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, and then Jane, to your point about the 20,000 headcount cuts, and I heard you just mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions. Where are the rest 15,000 coming?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nLet me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of Q1. As we said, we're expecting to get about $1 billion US dollars of run rate saves from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish phase III, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed.\nThat's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. It's about 13%. These are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier. When we think about where other expense opportunities are on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures. We'll be continuing, and you've seen us been doing that, exiting marginal businesses, hobbies, and the like, and being very disciplined about that. We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you will begin to see some of the impact of that in Q1. He's off to a strong start. Then we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities.\nWe've still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be aggregating those, creating utilities, or consolidating some of those different functions. That is before we get to beginning to get benefits from the transformation where there'll be efficiencies that come through. We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments. It's going to be expense growth still in the top in the from volume growth that we've got. We will be investing in our transformation. All of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12 ROTCE target we talked about. So that 20,000 is the number that we estimate of the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount. I like thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number.\nAs Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense save that we're expecting to achieve in the medium term. These are the raft of different areas that will be contributing to it. We're working hard at it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Really some ticky tack modeling questions. On the revenue side, does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees, and how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nLet's see. So obviously, you know, the proposal's out there and we factored in, you know, what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there, you know, offsets and mitigates that over time will be able to kind of bring into play. And so long with the way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late fee adjustment.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around Services NII, I am struggling to reconcile the 50/50 NII contribution from rate and volume components just given average loans and deposits were essentially flat. Year on year, NII grew $3 billion US dollars. It does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit fund transfer pricing and other noise, so I was hoping you can maybe unpack that a little bit further.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nI mean, there are a lot of factors in there. You know, there's obviously as well the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US, so it's, it's. There are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here, but we're happy to kind of follow up with you offline and take you through it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst and Managing Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, just a clarification. When you said medium term in this call, as it relates to employee reductions, expense savings, revenue targets, and 11% to 12 ROTCE, does medium term mean by 2026 or does it mean something different?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nIt's 2026.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citi\n\nYeah.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst and Managing Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citi\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.\n\nJenn Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citi\n\nThank you everyone for joining the call. If you have any follow up questions, please contact IR. Have a great day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Citi Q4 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.\nThe host has ended this call. Goodbye."

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. I should touch briefly on the macro environment before reviewing the quarter and last month's organizational announcement. The global macro backdrop remains the story of desynchronization. In the U.S., recent data implies a soft landing, but history would suggest otherwise, and we are seeing some cracks in the lower FICO consumers.\nIn the euro area and the U.K., the picture has turned distinctly more negative. The summer weakness in industrial economies is spreading south and the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs suggests a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region. China's economy may have reached a cyclical bottom, supported by the government's modest stimulus efforts, but it still has to work through week sentiment, use unemployment and the pain in its property market. All of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment.\nSeptember is always a busy month being clients, and I'm struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic about 2024 than a few months ago. The shift in the rate question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity, however, corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe. Our multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and are building redundancy and resiliency. And this plays to our strengths and strategy, in particular, our invaluable global network. And between our high-quality asset portfolio, our strong reserve levels are ample liquidity and our diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we are truly a bank for all seasons.\nTurning to the quarter. Today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 7.7%. Our revenues were up 10% ex divestitures, and each of our 5 core interconnected businesses posted revenue growth. We remain on track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year.\nLet's start with our fastest-growing business, services. TTS was up 12% from a year ago. That's the highest revenue quarter in over a decade, and it continues to outpace the target we set at Investor Day. Half of that growth was, business drivers, and the other half, rates. And even with the impact of the long expected Argentine devaluation, we again drove fee growth, which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading franchise.\nWe keep relentlessly innovating for our clients. Amongst other launches this quarter, we announced the creation of Citi Token Services, which will use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver a digital asset solution for our TTS clients. And this is the first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly integrate a permission tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as 24/7 dollar clearing.\nSecurity Services had revenue growth of 16% with some good underlying fee growth. We took share again, and we have grown our AUC and AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year. This business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefiting from the cloud and data investments we're making.\nMarkets was up 10% year-over-year on the back of rates and currencies having the best third quarter in 10 years and commodities, which also grew nicely. This was partially offset by equities, which was down slightly. Despite this, we continue to see good momentum in cash, and we have grown our prime balances year-to-date.\nBanking had a good quarter with revenues up 17% with activity playing to our mix. Now while corporate lending was essentially flat as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet, DCM was healthier. And the IPO market also showed some signs of life. This helped drive investment banking revenue up 34%, albeit of a low base and a small wallet. Sitting here today, it remains hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Still, I'm proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far this year.\nAs you know, we're committed to growing our banking franchise. We brought together the management of the investments, corporate and commercial banks under one umbrella. And this structure will help us better drive the important synergies between all 3. We've been bringing in new talent in key sectors, and we've begun to provide more leverage finance for key clients in the right situation.\nU.S. Personal Banking was also up double digits at 13%. Cards revenues were strong in both our branded and Retail Services portfolios. The growth in spending is decelerating and the consumer is more mindful what they spend on. Indeed, the affluent, who still have excess savings at their disposal drove the growth in spending with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment.\nDuring the quarter, we introduced Simplified Banking to improve the client experience for our retail banking clients. We believe that by peering offerings and simplifying our fee structure, we're going to incentivize our clients to deepen their relationships with us. And the early reaction from clients along those lines has been very positive.\nWealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly. Most notably, investment revenues picked up across our geographies. And the drivers of the franchise, such as referrals, client acquisition and net new inflows were all quite strong around the world. And we won important new mandates for wealth at work, an offering we had highlighted at Investor Day.\nAndy Sieg has now officially joined our firm. This is a time of massive global wealth creation, and our franchise is uniquely positioned for it. Andy will ensure we're at the forefront of what's happening around the world.\nIn terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past 5 years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection.\nOur CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% and which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buyback quarter-by-quarter, and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board. And while the ultimate impact of potentially higher capital requirements won't be known until the Basel III Endgame is finalized. We have been actively working through mitigating actions.\nAs you can see on Slide 3, we are relentless in executing our strategy. This quarter, we closed on the sale of our Taiwan consumer business, and that's the second largest of the Asia consumer divestitures. And earlier this week, we announced that we will sell our consumer wealth portfolio in China to HSBC, and this includes approximately $2.6 billion in assets under management and $1 billion of deposits.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the sale of our Indonesia consumer business. In terms of the international consumer businesses, we're exiting. In addition to the 3 wind down Markets, we've restarted the sales process in Poland, and we remain on track to separate Mexico next year, followed by an IPO in 2025.\nTransformation remains our #1 priority. We're deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms and upgrading our data architecture. We're committed to doing this the right way. Knowing it will take time to meet our regulators' expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure.\nLast month, we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. I said at the Investor Day, the organizational simplification would follow the divestitures. The changes will eliminate layers, duplication and complexity allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution.\nElevating the 5 core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive breakthrough accountability and sustainable results. So to bring it to life. The actions we've taken in the last 4 weeks will eliminate over 15% of the regional and functional roles at the top 2 layers of the company. It also take out 60 committees, which frees up over tens of thousands of people hours annually. We've identified approximately 1,000 or 50% of our internal financial management reports that we won't need any longer.\nAnd we have taken up co-heads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decision-making. We're cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first 2 layers in September, and the next set of changes will be implemented by mid-November, and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year.\nWhen we speak in January, Mark and I will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics showing the impact of the simplification amongst other details. Now while expenses is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending the expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year. And at the end of the work, we will have a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve our clients and unlock value for our shareholders. We've made tough decisions here. And I want to note how pleased I've been with how the leaders of the firm, especially the next generation, have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them. They fully understand that we need to change how we run Citi in order to truly transform it once and for all.\nBefore I close, I'd like to address our people in Israel. We are a significant bank in the country, and many of our people have lost friends and loved ones. Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they're dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm, frankly, in awe of their commitment to our clients and each other.\nMore broadly, the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds, is absolutely devastating to witness. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses.\nOn Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 7.7% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are divestiture-related impacts of approximately $214 million after tax, primarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52 and with an RoTCE of 7.2%.\nIn the quarter, total revenues increased by 9% on a reported basis and 10% excluding divestiture-related impacts, driven by strength across services, cards, and markets as well as modest growth in banking, partially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind downs.\nOur results include expenses of $13.5 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and $13.4 billion, excluding divestiture-related costs, also up 6%. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, up 35% and primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and volume growth. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year-to-date, we reported an RoTCE of 8.3%.\nOn Slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes. Expenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including investments in transformation as well as risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, macro factors, including inflation and FX, severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter and roughly $640 million on a year-to-date basis. This included actions across banking, markets, wealth and the functions. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind downs. And our technology spend across the firm was $3 billion in the quarter, up 8% and largely driven by investments in product development, platform enhancements and improving the client experience.\nAlso driving the increase is continued investment in technology for the transformation as we address the consent orders and modernize the firm. As we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span the following themes: platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements, and data improvements. And we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts, and the FDIC special assessment.\nOn Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million. Excluding Markets, net interest income increased $332 million, primarily driven by growth in PBWM, as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads. A pickup in services, driven by higher deposit spreads as a result of higher interest rates and active beta management, partially offset by reductions from closed exits and wind downs.\nAverage loans were up 1%, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking across cards and retail banking as well as TTS. Average deposits were down 2%, and largely driven by services, as we saw nonoperational deposit outflows as expected in light of quantitative tightening, and our net interest margin increased 1 basis point.\nOn Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio is nearly 2.7% and within that, U.S. cards is 7.8%. In PBWM, 45% of our loans are in U.S. cards and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And both branded cards and Retail Services NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels, but are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 55% of our PBWM loan are largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending.\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. Corporate nonaccrual loans increased by $490 million but remained low at 68 basis points of total corporate loans. And we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 1%. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totals approximately $65 billion, of which 86% is investment grade with a total reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.4%.\nTo give you a sense of the macro scenario that underpin our over $20 billion of reserves. Our current scenario weighted average unemployment rate is approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario with an average unemployment rate of roughly 7%. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios.\nOn Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well-diversified business model.\nWe leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $782 billion are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $416 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and global wealth deposits. We have approximately $569 billion of HQLA and approximately $666 billion of loans, and we maintained total liquidity resources of $937 billion.\nOur LCR was 117%. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 ratio based on standardized RWA, which is our binding constraint. Although not binding, our advanced RWA did increase this quarter, largely driven by business activity. And our tangible book value per share was $86.90, up 8% from a year ago.\nOn Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the second quarter. First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common, which added 28 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points. And finally, the remaining 2 basis point increase was primarily driven by lower DTA deductions and a net reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points or $14 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3% as of October 1.\nBefore we move on, I'd like to spend a minute on capital. We continue to optimize our RWA and capital, which we expect to be a tailwind over time. Contributing to this is the execution of our strategy, such as further diversifying our business mix and simplifying our business model, including exiting our 14 international consumer markets. Our investments in the transformation will continue to enhance our data, analytics and stress testing capabilities, enabling continued capital optimization. And of course, in light of the evolving regulatory environment, we're also looking at other mitigating actions, but those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play out. These actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products, divesting certain equity investments and reevaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer.\nWe consistently demonstrated our ability to manage our RWA and capital levels. through various macro environments and the evolving regulatory landscape, and we'll continue to do so.\nOn Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the third quarter. Revenues were up 12% this quarter, driven by double-digit growth across services, markets and banking. In the quarter, normal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in ICG. On an ex FX basis, ICG revenues would have been up 15%. Additionally, there was an approximately $180 million negative impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country, mainly across TTS, Markets and Security Services.\nExpenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity saves. Cost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit loss. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.4 billion up 12%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.\nAverage loans were down 4% and as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources across the businesses, including the reduction in subscription credit facility. Average deposits were flat as new client acquisition and deepening of relationships with existing clients were offset by nonoperational deposit outflows. ICG delivered an ROTCE up 10% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date.\nOn Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade. Revenues were up 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income. Noninterest revenues were up 1%, and on an ex FX basis, noninterest revenues would have been up 8%.\nWe continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with cross-border flows up 16%, outpacing global GDP growth and year-to-date, cross-border flows were up 12%. U.S. dollar clearing volumes are up 6% both year-over-year in the quarter and year-to-date. And commercial card volumes were up 8% year-over-year driven by growth in business-to-business payments and travel and entertainment spend. And year-to-date, commercial card volumes were up 20%.\nIn fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 40% across all client segments. These include marquee mandates, where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. We continue to make good progress on our commercial client strategy. As year-to-date wins more than doubled, driven by expansion into new markets and growth in multiproduct mandates from clients with cross-border needs.\nIn Securities Services, revenues were up 16% and driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Noninterest revenues were up 3%. We're very pleased with the progress we're seeing in Security Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 10% or $2.1 trillion. Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by fixed income. Fixed income revenues were up 14% and largely driven by strength in our rates and currency franchise. While volatility remains subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter. Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in cash and prime. And we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target.\nAnd finally, banking revenues. Excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were up 17%, driven by investment banking, which increased 34% on a reported basis and 12% excluding marks. Here, too, we saw a pickup in activity in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, particularly in DCM, but also in M&A as we closed a few deals earlier than expected. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, and there's more work to be done, we're making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses.\nNow turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 10%, driven by net interest income growth of 9% and a 20% increase in noninterest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in Retail Services and higher investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments and severance, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios.\nAverage loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 2%, largely reflecting our clients putting cash to work in investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 8.8% and 6.6% on a year-to-date basis.\nOn Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. This quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Personal Banking, driven by cards. Branded cards revenues were up 12%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 5%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 12%.\nRetail Services revenues were up 21% and driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments on the heels of higher net credit losses. In the card portfolio, we continue to see the investments we've been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interest-earning balances of 15% in branded cards and 12% in Retail Services.\nRetail banking revenues decreased 3%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business, partially offset by higher deposit spreads. Wealth revenues were up 2% and driven by higher investment fees across all regions and segments. The benefit from relationships transferred from retail banking and higher lending revenue. We also saw strong net new inflows across all regions. And year-to-date, new client acquisitions were up almost 30% in the private bank and over 60% in wealth at work. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making across these businesses.\nOn Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues were down 13%, largely driven by the difference in onetime gain on sale impacts in the Asia consumer businesses as well as the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind downs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico.\nIt's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 32%, primarily driven by Mexican peso appreciation, higher interest rates and volume growth. Ex FX, Mexico revenues were up 16%. Expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind down, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and Mexican peso appreciation. And expenses in Mexico were up 27% and but Ex FX expenses were up 11%.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by the absence of mark-to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior year and expenses decreased largely driven by lower consulting fees.\nOn Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2023 outlook. With 1 quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Having said that, based on what we've seen play out year-to-date in terms of U.S. and non-U.S. rates and lagging non-U.S. betas, we now expect net interest income to be slightly above $47.5 billion, for the full year, excluding Markets.\nAnd we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize with both portfolios reaching pre-COVID levels by year-end. And as it relates to buybacks, we expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We're executing on our strategy and delivering top line revenue growth of 5% year-to-date. We continue to invest for the long term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver our expense guidance. We're focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure, which will further support our speed of execution.\nWe're managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory headwinds while continuing to optimize and return capital to shareholders, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our RoTCE target of 11% to 12% in the medium term. And again, we look forward to hosting a more expansive fourth quarter earnings call, where we plan to share additional details related to the organizational simplification including expected related severance and expense saves as well as our outlook for 2024.\nWith that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. While this quarter wasn't as eventful as the first quarter, it was not without its moments. The global economy continues to be remarkably resilient, although the macro backdrop differs across key markets. Another bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding rigorously to inflation and have made it clear that cycle of hikes isn't over.\nIn the U.S., the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or 2024. With the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy. The Eurozone has also exceeded expectations. However, most countries there are facing pressure from labor and energy costs challenging the region's longer-term competitiveness. China is the biggest disappointment as growth decelerated after an initial post reopening pop. I was there last month and let's just say, a few on the ground expect China to be a strong driver of global growth this year as some had hoped.\nThe bottom line, globally, we continue to see the same quite challenging macroeconomic conditions that we saw in the first quarter. From Citi's perspective, we continue to see the benefits of our diversified business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank. Despite the turbulence, the macro backdrop of the first half we're on track with the plan we laid out at Investor Day, and we remain committed to our strategy and our medium-term ROTCE target.\nToday, we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex divestures are relatively flat to last year, and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78 million to $79 billion for the year. We are also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year, and consistent with the plan we shared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our transformation.\nIn services,[ TTS ] continues to deliver with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest income and noninterest revenue as we win, fee-generating mandates with new clients and deepen our relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We're proud of our #1 ranking for large institutional clients and this week, we announced our latest innovation, Citi direct commercial banking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network.\nSecurity Services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We're really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. We've gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we've been making. Markets revenues were down 13%, compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remain strong and we achieved our medium-term revenue to RWA target again this quarter.\nIn banking, the momentum in investment-grade debt has spread into other DCM products but the long-awaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize, and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with investment banking revenues down 24%. We continue to rightsize the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas, such as technology and health care.\nIn the U.S. Taken together, our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth, aided by customer engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In branded cards, spend is still strong in travel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise, and we have launched a lot of new innovations from transforming our Thank You Rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the premium card with our long-term partner, American Airlines. Credit normalization is happening faster in retail services given the profile of the portfolio. And overall, I'd say we're seeing a more cautious consumer, but not necessarily a recessionary one.\nWealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift, particularly in the private bank and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen actively pick up a bit in Asia for 2 quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the U.S. retail banks are increasing and globally, new client acquisition in the private bank and wealth are work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisers and bankers.\nTurning to expenses. They were elevated this quarter as we expected. This includes the additional repositioning actions we took to rightsize set businesses and functions in light of the current environment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter. Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of '24 through 3 significant efforts.\nFirst, we continue to make investments in our transformation and other risk and control initiatives, which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls as well as to improve the client experience. As we've said before, we will start to see the more material benefit of these investments over the medium term.\nSecond, as part of our simplification efforts, we expect to close the sales of our remaining 2 Asia consumer franchises by year-end, and we plan to restart the exit process in Poland. As you can see on this slide, we made excellent progress this quarter in the consumer businesses were winding down, aided by material asset sales. And we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the TSAs in the markets that we have already exited.\nYou saw our determination to execute when we decided to IPO [ Banamex ] after exploring a sale. We should complete the process of separating the 2 businesses fully next year in preparation for the IPO. And I'm pleased with the progress on the ground. We are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained businesses. All this means that by year-end, considering how far the divestitures and wind downs have progressed, legacy franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico, Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs.\nAs such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model. Together, these 3 efforts are why we have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of 2024 and continue to bring down expenses over the medium term.\nLet me end with capital. Well, you won't be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our stress capital buffer. We have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of noninterest revenue. And the industry awaits further clarity on capital requirements and importantly, their implementation timing from the holistic review the regulators have undertaken and the expected Basel III endgame NPR.\nThere is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be. And we, like the rest of the industry, we'll need to work through the implications. The exit of 14 international consumer markets coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix will help reduce our capital ratios. In addition, we have other levers to pull over time such as capital allocation, DTA utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders as you saw with our decisions to repurchase $1 billion in common stock and increase the dividend. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%. It's 100 basis points above our upcoming requirements after returning a total of $2 billion in capital, and we grew our tangible book value per share to $85.34.\nGiven the environment, we will continue to look at our level of capital return on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made, but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would both be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment.\nOn Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an ROTCE of 6.4% or $19.4 billion of revenues.\nEmbedded in these results are after-tax divestiture related impacts of approximately $92 million. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 and with an ROTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 1%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across services, U.S. Personal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio was more than offset by declines in markets, investment banking and wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.\nOur results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related costs. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion primarily driven by the continued normalization in cards net credit losses and ACL builds largely related to growth in card balances. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27% and primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture-related impacts, our effective tax rate was 26%.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And through the first half of 2023, we reported an ROTCE of 8.7%.\nOn Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter. Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors including investment in risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation as well as severance and all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and wind-downs. Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million and $450 million year-to-date as we took further actions across investment banking, markets and the functions. We're investing in the execution of our transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees.\nAnd as we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span across the following themes: platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization client experience enhancements and data improvements. And across these themes, technology spend was $3 billion in the quarter, up 13%, primarily driven by change the bank spend. Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture related impacts and the FDIC special assessment.\nOn Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends. The increase in net interest income ex markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially offset by the mix shift that we've seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM. Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind down markets and a decline in ICG as we continue to optimize the loan portfolio, including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities.\nAverage deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS as we saw some nonoperational outflow as expected in light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this, we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones. And our net interest margin increased 7 basis points.\nOn Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loans ratio was approximately 2.7%. And within that, U.S. cards is 7.9%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher and NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in well, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending.\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate nonaccrual loans remain low at about 44 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios.\nOn Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $818 billion are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries.\nThese institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of U.S. retail consumer and global wealth deposits, as you can see on the bottom right side of the page, we have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119% and our net stable funding ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 ratio and our tangible book value per share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago.\nOn Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the first quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common, which added 22 basis points. Second, we returned $2 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 18 basis points. And finally, the remaining 14 basis point decrease was primarily driven by RWA growth, as we continue to grow card balances, partially offset by optimizing RWA in markets and corporate lending. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio which includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer.\nWe expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023, which incorporates the increase in our stress capital buffer from 4% and to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we will continue our dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between their model results and ours, specifically in noninterest revenue. That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent, predictable and repeatable revenue stream as well as reduce risk and simplify our firm by exiting 14 international consumer markets. The strategy and the simplification, coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time.\nThe continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help SCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated headwinds in capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital, and we will continue to reassess the appropriate level of our management buffer over time.\nOn Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter. Revenues were down 9% this quarter as growth in services was more than offset by markets in banking. Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in TTS and Risk and Controls as well as approximately $120 million of severance in investment banking and markets, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $58 million as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG delivered an ROTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023. Average loans were down 6%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 1% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones.\nOn Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in noninterest revenue. It's also worth noting that TTS revenues were up 20% on an XFX basis. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS and that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6% both in the quarter and through the first half, cross-border flows up 11%, outpacing global GDP growth again, both in the quarter and through the first half and commercial card volume up roughly 15% led by spend in travel.\nIn fact, similar to the last [indiscernible] client wins are up approximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In Security Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currency. We are pleased with the progress in security services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in security services.\nAs a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy in our 2 of our higher returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm. Markets revenues were down 13%, driven by both fixed income and equities relative to an exceptional quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed income revenues were down 13% as strength in our rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in currencies and commodities. Equities revenues were down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in equity derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow prime balances driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA part.\nAnd finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 22%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty continue to impact client activity as well as lower revenues in corporate lending. While we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there's more work to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments that we've made in health care and technology coverage will benefit us over time. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we're making progress against our strategy in ICG.\nNow turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7% and partially offset by a 6% decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $335 million primarily driven by card balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 1% and largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023. Largely reflecting the challenging environment for wealth and higher credit costs.\nOn Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline and that, combined with the investments that we've been making, contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in branded cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive 25,000 wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% year-over-year.\nWealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs particularly in the private bank. However, Wealth and Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong lending results primarily in mortgages. Client advisers were down 1%, reflecting the repacing of strategic hiring. And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in Wealth and Work in the second quarter. While there's clearly more work to do in well, we are seeing good momentum in the underlying drivers.\nOn Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues were down 1% as the benefit of higher rates and volumes in Mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exit and wind down. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 22% and 10% ex FX. Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses decreased 8%.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other for the second quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses also increased driven by inflation and severance.\nOn Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts, although the mix has shifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46 billion for the full year, excluding markets, offset by lower noninterest revenue, largely driven by investment banking and wealth.\nWe're also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion excluding 2023, divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessments. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end. And we now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients, including fees and benefits from U.S. and non-U.S. rates on NII.\nWe also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses driven by continued investments in transformation and risk and controls. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in line with expectations. And our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25% and excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our firm, improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time. We're seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our business and as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we remain focused on achieving our medium-term ROTCE target.\nAnd with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another interesting year. Given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks, I'm going to share some observations, and then we'll turn to what was a good quarter.\nFirst, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as someone who has worked in many different systems around the world. The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and larger global banks, including Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on different scale.\nI would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators, that help reinforce confidence in the system at a very critical juncture. I'm pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our clients. That's not an accident. We are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how we run the firm, from client selection to capital planning.\nAnd it's also thanks to our people, and I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to Citi as a port in the storm.\nRecent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While Mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk, liquidity and capital, I do want to mention a few things myself.\nIn terms of assets, our loans are high quality and short duration. We have highly liquid investment securities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion worth of available liquidity resources, including $584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over $1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries and regions, many of which are operational in nature. Indeed, the cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payroll to their supply chains to their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all 3 of our integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions.\nThe data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. And this greatly increases our deposit stickiness. It's also why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more.\nFinally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both assets and liability concentrations across client segments, industry and region. And we're confident in the size and nature of our exposures, given our very rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the interconnectedness of financial institutions.\nWe are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face, which is particularly relevant given the degree of uncertainty today. The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent event to be disinflationary and credit to contract. We believe it's now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this year. That could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch. But right now, the biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term U.S. interest rates and of course, how the debt ceiling plays out.\nIn Europe, the ECB is on a similar but more difficult quest to tame inflation. They have had some help from lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending, and Europe faces more structural challenges, such as the need for increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult.\nIn Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region, although the Chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to India, Japan and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the U.S.-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs. And we see this translate into a shift in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global network.\nNow turning to how we performed this quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex divestitures, and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our RoTCE of nearly 11% benefited from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains.\nLet me highlight our operating performance in each of our 5 core businesses. In Services, TTS has continued to go from strength to strength with revenues up 31%. Noninterest revenue was up 11% quarter-on-quarter on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel.\nSecurities Services wasn't too shabby either, up 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefited from higher rates. Within market, our fixed income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefited from excellent performance in rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third best in a decade. Equities was much weaker, however, down markedly in both derivatives and cash, although it still had revenues north of $1 billion.\nBanking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a pickup, including increased activity in the investment-grade market. In U.S. Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continued to normalize to pre-COVID levels and beyond. Branded cards and retail services saw revenues up 18% and 24%. Retail banking saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experience a significant increase in digital deposits. We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories were down.\nSavings rates are below historic averages. And while the upper quintiles of household income still have roughly $1 trillion in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly drawn down. So we're keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services spend slow.\nFinally, while revenues were down again, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisers were all solid, and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenues later this year and beyond.\nWe also saw the early signs of a long-awaited Asian recovery. We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro outlook. NCLs continued to normalize in consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in another quarter of very low NCLs.\nFinally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have room to absorb the temporary upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue to pursue a dual-path here, and we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders over time.\nAs you can see from Slide 3, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and despite everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy we shared with you at Investor Day. We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure.\nWe made some significant leadership announcements. I'm delighted that Andy Sieg will join Citi at my table as the new Head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years.\nWith Karen Peetz retiring, we named Anand Selva as our Chief Operating Officer and asked him to take on running our enterprise-wide Transformation program, in addition to his current responsibilities. Anand has been at Citi for over 3 decades and has a strong track record of delivering results.\nIn terms of our transformation, we are completely focused on executing our plan to address the consent orders and improve our risk and control environment. Mark will walk you through specific examples of how we're modernizing our infrastructure, simplifying processes and improving data quality. Importantly, these efforts are improving the client experience and helping us deliver Citi's full capabilities to them.\nTo wrap up, it's 1 year after our Investor Day, and I'm proud of the progress we've made and our relentless focus on delivering. Our strategy is clear. Our business model is resilient and diversified. Our balance sheet is strong. We're making good progress on execution. Amidst considerable turmoil, we are delivering on our guidance and our commitments. Our team is determined to continue delivering with excellence.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital; then I will turn to the results of each segment.\nOn Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86, with an RoTCE of over 9%.\nIn the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, Fixed Income and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind downs.\nOur results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs in the prior year, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by the transformation, other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exits and wind downs.\nCost of credit was approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and ACL and other provision builds of approximately $700 million, largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balance. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%.\nOn Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove 1% of the growth, largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits, including the full year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter. Embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise-wide and in the businesses, which make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits.\nAnd across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%. We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come.\nNow turning to Slide 6. I'd like to spend a few minutes giving you some tangible examples of what we're investing in and the benefits we'll see over time. In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to 1 single modern platform, eliminating costs over time. And we have consolidated 11 platforms to 1 global sanctions-screening platform, reducing false alerts, improving the client experience and eliminating costs.\nWe're also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cybersecurity through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and streamline the connectivity between our front-office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual processes and operating costs over time. We're driving the strategy by investing in the client experience, both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products.\nWe launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for e-commerce clients in TTS. We're also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for commercial clients, so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the same way our large corporate clients do. And finally, we're investing in data to create advanced decision-making, client-targeting and risk management capabilities, which has allowed us to enhance our returns through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will allow us to self-fund future investments over time.\nOn Slide 7, we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG, and our net interest margin increased 2 basis points.\nOn Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We're well reserved for the current environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loan ratio was approximately 2.7%. And within that, U.S. cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending.\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiary. And corporate nonaccrual loans remain low at about 40 basis points of total loans.\nAs you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios.\nOn Slide 9, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We've added a few additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet. We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs.\nFirst, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion, are institutional and span 90 countries. And the majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive. So when rates go up, we reprice the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the level of rates. But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational services that we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of U.S. retail consumer and global wealth deposits, as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions and products, with 75% of U.S. Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having been with Citi for more than 10 years. Our Wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding deposits and investment products.\nNow turning to the asset side. At a high level, you can think of our deposits being largely deployed in 3 asset buckets: loans, investment securities and cash, which complement the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity value of our liability. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy. We use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital.\nOur $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable rate. About 35% of our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities, which contribute to our $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly $100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can see the details of this on Page 27 in the appendix.\nBut just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the composition and duration of that liquidity. And our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, agency and other sovereign bonds and is split evenly between available for sale and held to maturity, where we've maintained a short duration of less than 3 years, so we could benefit from higher interest rates. And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risks, liquidity and capital.\nSo in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and duration and reflect a diversified business model and execution of our strategy.\nOn Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from the end of the fourth quarter, first, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 38 basis points; second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points; third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase; and finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our consumer exits.\nWe ended the quarter with a 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 40 basis points higher than last quarter, and this includes a 100-basis point internal management buffer. And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter, and we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nOn Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up 1% this quarter, largely driven by services and fixed income, mostly offset by investment banking and equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23% driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% RoTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down 2%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns.\nAverage deposits were up 3% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end-of-period basis, ICG deposits were down 3% sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter.\nOn Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% in NIR with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6%, reflecting continued swift share gains; cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth; and commercial card volumes up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel.\nSo while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 40% as we continued to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact, client wins are up approximately 50% across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank.\nIn Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 6% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are 2 of our higher-returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm.\nMarkets revenues were down 4% as growth in fixed income was more than offset by equities. Fixed income revenues were up 4% relative to a very strong quarter last year as strength in our rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in FX and commodities.\nEquities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in cash and equity derivatives. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target.\nAnd finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially, largely driven by the investment-grade market opening up. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress that we're making in ICG.\nNow turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $500 million, largely driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumption and growth in card revolving balance.\nAverage loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs.\nOn Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%; card spend volumes up 9%; and average loans up 15%. Retail services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income.\nFor both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline. And that, combined with the investments that we've been making, contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in branded cards and 11% in retail services. Retail banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive over 13,000 wealth referrals in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwind and higher deposit costs, particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia, which were up approximately 20% on a sequential basis.\nClient advisers were up 3%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62% and 81%, respectively. While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we're seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on sale of our Consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind downs and closed consumer exits. Expenses decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as the impact of the wind downs and closed consumer exits.\nOn Slide 16, we show results for Corporate/Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. Despite recent events and the economic uncertainty that remains, our full year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged. We have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources and ample capital and liquidity. This positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios. We're seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our strategy. The financial path will not be linear, but we are confident that we can achieve our medium-term targets.\nAnd finally, I'm incredibly proud of how our firm and our employees have continued to help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system.\nAnd with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations.\n(Operator Instructions). Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and happy new year to everyone joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start 2023. Today, I'll share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter. And then I will take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the coming year.\nThe global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we enter 2023, environments have had better than we all expected for the time being at least, despite the aggressive tightening by the Central Bank. In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak.\nThat said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the Eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with. In Asia, while the public health impact in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID-Zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally. And here at home, the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected, in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings.\nThe Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation, however, and therefore, we continue to see the U.S. entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year. Now turning to how we performed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of $1.16. Our full year revenue growth of 3% ex divestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor Day, as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an ROTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%. This quarter, our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year, and we're quite pleased with some and less happy with the performance of others.\nServices continues to deliver cracking revenue growth. Our markets businesses are navigating the environment very well, and we're seeing good momentum in U.S. Personal Banking. On the flip side, investment banking felt the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in '22 and the environment for wealth remained a challenging one. Unpacking that a bit, services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services.\nTTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our global network had revenues up 36% year-over-year as we execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations.\nLikewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under administration and custody. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory with revenues up 18% from 2021. We have the #1 FICC franchise on the Street during the first 3 quarters of the year and fixed income was up 31% in the final quarter. Equities was down as the mix of client activity, again, did not play to our strength in derivatives.\nWith the wallet down significantly, our investment banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline looks more promising and the client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will turn in '23. Wealth Management's performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter, with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum and net new investment flows.\nSimilarly, we continue to build our client adviser base, albeit at a slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover. In U.S. Personal Banking, both cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly. Whilst in retail banking, we clearly have some more work to do. As you know, we've been actively managing our balance sheet and risk.\nOur cost of credit increased in line with our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in anticipation of a mild recession. And in the U.S., net credit losses in cards continue to normalize as we had expected, still well below pre-COVID levels. Corporate credit remains healthy, and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio.\nIn terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. And finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65, and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our common dividend.\nNow let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've already made. We simplified the bank, closing sales of our consumer businesses in 5 markets, including 3 in the fourth quarter. And we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea as well as our franchise in Russia.\nWe continue to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank. We're streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data. This will make us a better bank. We brought in very strong talent, met our representation goals and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I'm pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year. We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing and announced the findings from an external law firm, which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the U.S.\nFinally, I'm very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks, which define 2022 and supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout. Before I hand over to Mark, let's turn to the next few years and in particular, the path to achieving our medium-term return targets that we laid out on Page 5.\nAt Investor Day, we talked about the past coming in 3 phases, with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined execution and investment. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term shareholder value. We're focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the expectation that our businesses will close out '23 competitively stronger. Services entered '23 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovation and market-leading product capabilities. Markets continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the businesses focused on capital productivity.\nBanking and Wealth are well positioned for when the cycle turns, thanks to the investments we've made in top talent and technology as well as the synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the right time to make (inaudible) and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business.\nI asked Jim O'Donnell to take on a new role, focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep expertise and relationships, and when combined with (inaudible) additional role as North America Head, it's designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market.\nU.S. Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery and borrowing, taking full advantage of our market-leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the card space. We will make further progress on our international consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will, of course, focus on our clients, deepening relationship and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy. We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise, including the investments in our transformation and controls. However, we will pace some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment.\nLooking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets. We'll do so through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our transformation and further simplification, and Mark will cover this in more detail shortly.\nWe fully recognize this suppresses our returns in the near term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary to reach our medium-term return targets and to create long-term shareholder value. We are carrying not just our momentum, but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments.\nWe are running the bank differently with a relentless focus on execution, and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I'll also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023.\nOn Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16 and an ROTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenue. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impact of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10 with an ROTCE of approximately 5.5%.\nIn the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5% excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across services, market and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking, wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exit. Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year.\nExcluding divestiture-related costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5%, largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exit.\nCost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses, particularly in retail services and an ACL build of $645 million, largely related to growth in cards and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income and an ROTCE.\nNow turning to the full year revenue walk on Slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up 3%, excluding the impact of divestitures, in line with our guidance of low single-digit growth. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were up 32%, driven by continued benefit from rates as well as business actions such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments. Higher wins have accelerated due to the investments that we've been making in market-leading product capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 U.S. dollar clearing capability in the industry, the 7-day cash suite product that we launched earlier this year, and instant payment, which is live in 33 markets, reaching over 60 countries.\nSo while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business action and investments drove the remaining half. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 1% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuation.\nFor the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins, and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. In markets, we grew revenue 7%, mainly driven by strength in rates and FX as we continue to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital. This was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives. On the flip side, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 39%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity.\nIn cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continue to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022 along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels. And in wealth, revenues were down 2%, largely driven by market valuations in China lockdown. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 3%. Corporate Other also benefited from higher NII in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in legacy franchises, excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased by about $1.3 billion as we closed 5 of the exit markets and continue to wind down Russia and Korea consumer.\nGoing forward, we would expect legacy franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit market. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8% in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%, with about 2/3 of the increase related to risk, control, data and finance program. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology.\nAbout 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding scalability to our TTS and Securities Services platform, enhancing client experiences across all businesses and developing new product capabilities. We also continue to invest in front office talent, albeit at a more measured pace, given the environment, and volume-related expenses were up 1%, largely driven by market and cards. The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit market.\nAcross the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year. On Slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets that we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions, including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn't anticipate at Investor Day, impacted some KPIs positively and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy.\nIn TTS, we continue to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we roll out new product offerings and invest in the client experience, which is a key part of our strategy. Client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments. And these again include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. For the third quarter year-to-date, we estimate that we gained about 70 basis points of share and maintained our #1 position with large institutional clients.\nIn addition, we've onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chain to address the evolving global landscape. And in Securities Services, we onboarded new client assets, which offset some of the decline in market valuation. And we estimate that we'll gain about 50 basis points of share in Securities Services through the third quarter of this year, including in our home market. In markets, we strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress towards our revenue to RWA card.\nIn cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both branded cards and retail services. Card spend volumes were up 14%, end-of-period loans up 13% and most importantly, interest-earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like investment banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our market position. And in wealth, while we have brought on new advisers and new client assets, given the impact of market valuation, this didn't translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point.\nSo in summary, we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments, and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium term. Now turning back to the fourth quarter on Slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven by services, cards and market.\nAverage loans were down as growth in cards was more than offset by declines in ICG and legacy franchise. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 1%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average deposits were up driven by growth in ICG and PBWM, and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points.\nOn Slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit mix. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio is approximately 2.6%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. card is 3.8% and 7.6%, respectively, both just above day 1 CECL level. And we feel very good about the high quality nature of our portfolio. In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that, branded cards makes up 66% and retail services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total card exposure is to prime customers. And NCL rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels.\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That said, we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentration under a range of scenarios. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels.\nOn Slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 1/4 or just under $600 billion consists of (inaudible) dollars. And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago. On Slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 (inaudible) to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter, first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income to common, which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividend, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits, RWA optimization and market moves towards the end of the quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 basis points higher than the last quarter. As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes 100 basis point internal management book. That will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico consumer exit at signing while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients.\nAnd as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by 3% this quarter with TTS up 36% on continued strength in NII; Securities Services revenues up 22%; markets revenue, up 18% on strength in fixed income, partially offset by a decline in equity and investment banking revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume. Expenses increased 6%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, specifically in services and volume-related expenses partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings.\nCost of credit was $56 million, driven by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. ICG delivered a 7.9% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%. Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 3%, and sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICG grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered approximately $10.7 billion of net income with an ROTCE of 11.1%.\nNow turning to Slide 15. We show the results of our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 7%, driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives.\nCost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build, driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs were up, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in retail services. Average loans increased 6%, while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 1.4%, driven by the ACL build this quarter and higher expenses.\nFor the full year, PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in revenue. On Slide 16, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the closing of 5 exit markets as well as the impact of the wind down. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence of divestiture-related impact last year related to Korea.\nOn Slide 17, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses. On Slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1. We will continue to execute and invest, laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving long-term shareholder value. With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding any potential 2023 divestiture-related impacts, expenses to be roughly $54 billion, also excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact. Net credit losses in cards are expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13% CET1 target, and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close additional exit and announce others.\nOn Slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023, excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions. And for Securities Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuation and onboarding of additional client assets. We also assume somewhat of a normalization in wealth as lockdowns in China end and market valuations start to rebound. And we expect investment banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity.\nAs for market, we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022. Now turning to the NII guidance for 2023. We expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow volumes, particularly in cards, and we continue to get the benefit of U.S. and non-U.S. rate hikes in our services business.\nAs a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes the reduction of revenue from the exit and legacy franchises that we closed in 2022, and we expect to close this year in 2023. Turning to Slide 21. In 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that we've made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are, first, transformation, as we continue to invest in data, risk and control and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient. Second, business-led investments as we execute against our strategy. Third, volume-related expenses in line with our revenue expectations. And fourth, elevated levels of inflation mainly impacting compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exit.\nAnd we are investing in technology across the firm with total technology-related expenses increasing by 5%. While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses, these are investments that we have to make and I am certain that these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future.\nAnd finally, let's talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day, we said the medium term was 3 to 5 years. That time frame represented 2024 to 2026. So while a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11% to 12% ROTCE target in the medium term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reduction and capital levels largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11% to 12% ROTCE target. So let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe, which accelerated NII growth. And that, coupled with the execution of our strategy, has allowed certain businesses to accelerate.\nAt the same time, other businesses such as wealth and investment banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit. From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium term. And we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The 3 main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exit, which will be included in legacy franchise the benefits from our investments in transformation and control and the simplification of the organizational structure.\nFirst, let me remind you, at this point, the ongoing expenses in legacy franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and wind down, which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature, we expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes, the technology-enabled one. And finally, we remain focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reduction in the future.\nFrom a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future ACL build or releases will be a function of macro assumption and volume. So to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our path to achieve the 11% to 12% ROTCE in the medium term. And Jane, the rest of the firm and I, are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions)\nAlso as a reminder, this call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times. And overall, I am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them. As you'll hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment.\nSo before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth, and we now expect to experience rolling country level recession starting this quarter.\nThe severity and timing of these recessions depend where in the world you are. Although persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone in the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply, and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter's weather forecast and the energy supply.\nThe U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing, consumers and corporates remain healthy as our very low net credit losses demonstrate, supply chain constraints are easing, the labor market remains strong. So it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation. Now history would suggest that, that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of '23. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to expand it all else being equal in the geopolitical arena, that is.\nFinally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China's COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide. And I'd say we're more focused on market liquidity generally and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the near term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively, and we are prepared for all environments.\nAgainst this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 8.2%. We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. TTS saw revenues up 40% year-over-year with growth in each business and in fees. Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross-border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan.\nSecurity Services was up 15% despite assets under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we're seeing good momentum in issuer services, in particular. Markets, on the other hand, came in lower with revenues down 7%. In fixed income, we matched last year's particularly good showing through our long-standing strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform, led to lower revenues compared to last year's exceptional performance. And we continued to optimize RWA in market consistent with our strategy.\nBanking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities, including health care, technology and energy. And I'm really pleased with the high caliber bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture.\nThe environment for wealth management continued to be less than ideal. Our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies with our businesses, such as the wealth referral initiatives between commercial banking, retail banking and investment banking is progressing well. We also continue to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers, as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory. Card sales, ANR, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake.\nRetail Services joined Branded cards in having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail Banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase for the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and PBWM. There were effectively no credit losses in ICG, and U.S. consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels.\nConsumer loan growth together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses, and in our transformation, we are managing them closely, and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance.\nAs you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort, and we're committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogues with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I'm generally pleased with the advances we're making in the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March, and these are laid out on Page 3.\nWe're seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter.\nWe also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the wealth franchise there. I would also note, we're ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continued to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country.\nIn August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local commercial banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations.\nTurning to capital. We returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter, while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis as due to increasing regulatory requirements, we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year, and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points.\nWe ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2% as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So the bottom line is that while the environment is a challenging one, and we expect it will remain so, we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark. And then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance.\nOn Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an RoTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and RoTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively.\nIn the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were down 1% as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 18%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM.\nNoninterest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in investment banking, markets, and investment revenues in wealth. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation, inflation and other risk and control initiatives.\nCost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%.\nOn Slide 5, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year-over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit repricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in legacy franchises.\nExcluding FX, loans were largely flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the bank. Excluding FX, deposits were up roughly 1%. And sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points.\nOn Slide 6, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8% and 7%, excluding the impact of divestitures. 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology.\nAs of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth, and we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG, and approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\nAcross all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology-related spend of approximately 16% for the quarter. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework.\nThis framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations, including country, industry, credit rating and in the case of consumer, FICO scores. And importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our reserves to funded loan ratio was approximately 2.5%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day 1 CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers. And while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels.\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade and nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios, and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment.\nOn Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets about 23% or $557 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint. And our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago.\nOn Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our target over the next few quarters. First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5 basis point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3 basis point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14 basis point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization.\nIn light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement, we ended the quarter with a 12.2% CET1 ratio, 25 basis points higher than last quarter. Importantly, 12.2% is above our current regulatory requirement of 11.5% as of October 1 and above 12%, which will be our regulatory requirement as of January 1 of next year. As we said last quarter, we continue to gradually build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which includes the current 4% SCB and a 100 basis point management buffer.\nOn Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group, revenues were down 5% as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. Cost of credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million.\nWhile deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. Average loans were up 1%, driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9%.\nOn Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue.\nIn Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40%, driven by 61% growth in net interest income as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%, commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 9%.\nSo while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit repricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients. And client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions which are up almost 50%. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank.\nIn addition, so far this year, we have onboarded approximately 5,800 suppliers, and we recently launched our innovative suite product in the in the U.S. and Asia which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows 7 days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in Securities Services through the first half of this year, including in our home market.\nAs a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products.\nAnd through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year.\nAnd finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 49%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to marks on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients.\nNow turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment fee revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business-led investments and volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.\nCost of credit was $1.1 billion which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization, particularly in retail services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across branded cards, retail services and retail banking.\nAverage deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across retail and wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation. PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 9.7%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income.\nWe continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 9% in branded cards and 7% in retail services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter.\nRetail banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2% as investment fee headwinds, particularly in Asia, more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our wealth business with new clients in ultra-high net worth and Wealth at Work of 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter.\nAnd we're also leveraging our retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy.\nOn Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12% and largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down.\nOn Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture-related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income, offset by lower noninterest revenue. So for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income, excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts.\nRegarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture-related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

    "content": "Q2 2022 Citigroup Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2022 Citigroup Inc Earnings Call\n\nCNYSEJUL 15, 11:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nHello and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions) Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. When we last spoke, we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation.\nThere are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced. And now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cybersecurity, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond Europe. Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures, which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower U.S. consumer confidence.\nHigher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, while sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.\nSimilarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheet with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So while a recession could indeed take place over the next 2 years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory.\nI'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon.\nIn Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion, an EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year.\nServices continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade.\nThe market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange, rates, commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage. And while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline in markets, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well. And it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally, given their consistent trading needs, is a differentiating one for us in market.\nOn the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the Investment Banking wallet with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients have been less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In U.S. personal banking, the positive drivers we saw in our 2 credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in Branded Cards.\nAnd you can see how resilient the consumer is in the U.S. through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels.\nWhile volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions, leading to flat year-over-year wealth management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisers, expanding our Private Bank physical footprint to reach 20 countries with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the U.S. So the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance.\nOverall, while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon.\nWell, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on Slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-term goals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path.\nSimplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures, such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We're well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature.\nIn terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our Consumer & Commercial Banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model. And this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation.\nTo that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML consent order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves.\nLet me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So over the near term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including our 100 basis point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%.\nWe are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer, which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so.\nWe will make every effort to optimize our capital, especially in businesses such as Markets. So we balance the needs of our clients, our investors and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia; and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance.\nOn Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 with an RoTCE of 11.2% or $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11% with growth in both net interest income as well as noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Noninterest revenue grew 5% driven by fixed income and services, which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM.\nTotal expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture-related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44% and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%.\nOn Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to risk, controls, data and the finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms.\n2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and cards. And approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter.\nBefore we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts.\nTo this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to 1 loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market.\nGiven the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function.\nAnd we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to 1 cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments.\nOn Slide 6, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses. And we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM.\nLegacy franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held for sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points, and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points.\nOn Slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in wealth.\nFrom an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%.\nOn Slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a 5 basis point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as the 12 basis point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale.\nWe ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, 50 basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. We expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October of 2022 to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from 3% to 4%. In January, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge.\nA combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirement. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients.\nGiven all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time.\nOn Slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation.\nAs a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter.\nOn Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Securities Services as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risk, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%.\nWe grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans, which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1% driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%.\nOn Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33% driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR as we saw a strong growth with both mid- and large corporate clients. And we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 61%.\nAgain, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41% driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services.\nOverall markets revenues were up 25%. The macro environment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31% driven by FX, rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we help them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity markets revenues were up 8% driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balance.\nBanking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending. So we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients.\nNow turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 12% driven by transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios.\nAverage loans grew 4% driven by strong growth in Branded Cards as well as growth across Retail Services and wealth. Average deposits grew 6% driven by growth across retail and wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our U.S. Cards businesses. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter.\nOn Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10% driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up 18% and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year.\nRetail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisers up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions, having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year.\nOn Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind down and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter, we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down.\nOn Slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective, and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year.\nIn terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8%, excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds.\nAnd with that said, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions) Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. (Operator Instructions). Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen. And I'd like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we'll be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress, and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2.\nToday is also the first time we're reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I'm going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I'll discuss how we're handling Russia, and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail.\nWe've been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged, and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest.\nWith central banks responding to inflation, we're entering a period of higher and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we're at the start of a new long super cycle, and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02 and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE.\nAnd let's turn to the performance of our 5 main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on Services, I'm particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Security Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021.\nAs you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve.\nIn U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth. So we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., Our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we're hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the private bank and in Citi Gold.\nTurning to capital. We returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter.\nI want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12%. And Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs you heard at Investor Day, we're focused on our transformation, and we're making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to (inaudible) our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term.\nSo far this year, we've announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico, and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you've heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the 3 remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia.\nWe started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January, and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We've been managing down our financial exposures, both in level and composition and there at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We've also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government, and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime.\nBut I've run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees, and we will continue to help in any way we can.\nSo with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of a war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can't blame (inaudible) for it.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment.\nOn Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02 and with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM, was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly.\nTotal expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%.\nOn Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchise as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in markets and cards. And approximately 4% and was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter.\nOn Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year-end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consists of loans, AFS, derivatives and off-balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consist of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year-end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion.\nAnd as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios, and we've taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day.\nOn Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM.\nOn Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year-end. During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year.\nAs we said at Investor Day, we're committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate-driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks, and we'll evaluate that level throughout the quarter, taking into account market conditions.\nOn Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we build capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35 basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15 basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year-end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders.\nOn Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion, largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51%, largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%.\nOn Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue.\nSecurities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43% and driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans.\nNow turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%.\nOn Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%.\nWhile payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in branded cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%.\nOn Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses.\nAnd to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions) Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. (Operator Instructions) Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Landis\n\nHead of IR, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Nind Fraser\n\nCEO & Director, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jen, and happy new year, everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities.\nAs you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high returning franchises. But our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm.\nAs we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network.\nThis won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring. And of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day.\nI'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we're making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refreshed strategy. Now these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward.\nFirst, we're creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment, which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of 2 distinct reporting units: Our U.S. personal banking businesses; and our global wealth management business, which is going to include the private bank.\nSecond, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra. We will begin reporting under 3 units: services, banking and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future.\nFinally, we will create a new segment, legacy franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter, to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March.\nNow turning to earnings. We had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on Slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT primarily related to the wind down of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. In ICG, we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in M&A. And we continue to make significant investments in talent, and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us.\nNow while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes was not quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products.\nParts of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID's disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the U.S., strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to resolve the impact of (inaudible). Now keep in mind, that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buyback, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that, that impact has been addressed.\nFinally, as Slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities: The strategy refresh, the transformation and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy. We are laser focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors. We have signed deals in 6 of the Asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell 4 markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within 8 months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them, and we are well into the process in the remaining markets.\nIn Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was to wind down our consumer operation, and we're able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is wealth management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisers relationship managers and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 private bank clients and 45,000 Citi gold clients in 2021. In what we know as U.S. Personal Banking, we've seen good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card, and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our security services platform.\nWe couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian for their iShares ETF. Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational for everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients.\nAs it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans.\nThird, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year-end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interest and various culture-changing initiatives. A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO 10 months ago.\nAnd of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic, such as inflation, or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through unchartered waters, and we will be with them in the next chapter as well.\nSo now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions.\n\nMark A.L. Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup Inc.\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure. And then finally, the quarterly results.\nAs part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets.\nTurning to Slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in the financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citi Banamex, and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy.\nSecond, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and security services to a reporting unit called Services. These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will, therefore, no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets.\nAnd lastly on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM. As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth, now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients.\nNorth America Consumer will be renamed to U.S. Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include branded cards, retail services and retail banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments, starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm.\nSlide 5 shows the contribution of the Citi Banamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits. And in the appendix on Page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date.\nTurning to Mexico. As Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment.\nOn the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture path, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico.\nIn addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm.\nNow turning to Slide 6. As we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure in terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income, and revenue that we previously referred to as non-NIR will now be called noninterest revenue.\nSecond, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a control revenue and net interest income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers, and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these 2 changes.\nOn Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46, an RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind down of our Korea consumer business, as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99, with an RoTCE of approximately 10%.\nIn the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services and Investment Banking, was mostly offset by lower net interest income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%. Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality.\nNow turning to the full year. Our revenues were down 5%, driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across ICG and in particular, in investment banking, TTS and security services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year.\nOn Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses, with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day.\nOn Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis, driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was flat. Also on a year-over-year basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-over-year as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB.\nAs the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet. This is different from our peers' methodology, which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100 basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over 3x more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income.\nOn Slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consists of HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. And we continue to optimize our balance sheet, deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our short-term and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans with loans to corporates outside of the U.S., representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade.\nFrom a capital perspective, we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 12.2%, as we prepared to adopt SACR on January 1. Having adopted SACR and maintained our capital ratio target, we are resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of 2021. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us, along with the rest of the industry, such as elevated GCIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico.\nIn light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SCB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year with the goal of returning excess capital to shareholders.\nOn Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investment banking, private bank and security services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance, with net credit losses declining on a year-over-year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year, largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter.\nWe also saw a 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%.\nOn Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year, driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees, in fact our highest fee quarter ever. And revenue did increase sequentially, driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we are showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents.\nU.S. dollar clearing transactions are up 4%, which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows, where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business and over 145 currencies. And importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generate significant operating deposits. Commercial card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and, on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% and of total TTS fee revenue.\nInvestment banking revenues were up 43% year-over-year, driven by growth across products, including record advisory performance the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year. And while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products.\nEquity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11%, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, partially offset by interest rate headwinds.\nNow turning to Slide 13. Here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year, driven by the Asia divestiture costs. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9%, driven by transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth. This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impacts, Net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues, with an RoTCE of 17% and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts.\nOn Slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24% and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis.\nWhile we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. Retail banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remained strong, with deposits up 13%, Citigold households up 9% and assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit.\nAsia revenues declined 7% year-over-year largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13% and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year, mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over-year, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down year-over-year, largely due to the wind down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. At this point, we typically give a full year outlook. However, since we have our Investor Day coming up on March 2, we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about 2022 in the full context of our strategy and medium-term performance expectations. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible. And I hope you like the new earnings presentation, and we will continue to evolve it going forward.\nAnd with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\n\nJen Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citigroup\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our Q1 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser and our Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website Citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors. Including those described in our earnings materials. Including as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. Today I'm going to touch on the macroeconomic environment before I update you on the progress we're making, and then I'll discuss the quarter. While global economic performance was surprisingly desynchronized last year, the overall story has been consistent of late, one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth this year looks poised to slow in many markets, and conditions are generally disinflationary. We're already seeing some central banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates. In the US, a soft landing is viewed as increasingly likely, but we continue to see a tale of two Europes, with Germany hurt by the weak demand for goods, while Southern European countries such as Spain and Greece benefit from stronger demand in services.\nIn Asia, Japan is joining India as a bright spot and China's economy has gained some more traction, although its property market remains a concern.\nAmidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of Citi to all our stakeholders.\nI said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities, the transformation, and the performance of our businesses and the firm. Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification that we announced in September. The result is a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy.\nWe are now more client centric. We're already seeing faster decision making and a nimbler organization at work. We have clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team, fewer layers, increased spans of control, and frankly, much less bureaucracy and needless complexity. This will all help us run the company more efficiently, will enhance our client's experience, and improve our agility and ability to execute. While reducing expenses wasn't the primary driver of the program, more roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 that we discussed in January. We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right-placing businesses to better capture synergies, exiting certain businesses in markets that just didn't fit with our strategy, and rightsizing the workforce in Wealth. As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification which we.\nare eliminating approximately 7,000 positions which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run rate expense saves. The combination of these actions and the measures we're taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 to 2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run rate saves. In the medium term, we are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the transformation is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades.\nWe've made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, and strengthen our risk and control environment, all of which are necessary not only to meet the expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively. A transformation of this magnitude, well, it's never linear. So while we've made good progress in many areas, there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right, and we'll look to self-fund the necessary investments to do so.\nTurning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, earnings per share of $1.58, and an ROTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% year-over-year. Excluding divestitures, which is primarily the $1 billion gain from the India consumer sale last year, our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC Special Assessments. Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue is up 8% for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients. Fees were up a pleasing 10% for Services year-over-year driven by the investments we've made across our product offering platforms and client experience.\nIn Securities Services we took share again this quarter, and in TTS cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth, and commercial card spend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our investor presentation on Services in June. Markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in 2023 while revenues were down 7% as low volatility impacted Rates and Currencies. That was off a very strong Q1 last year.\nWe saw good client activity in Equities and in Spread Products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust. We fully integrated our financing and securitization capabilities within our Markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients. The rebound in Banking gained speed during the quarter, led by near-record levels of investment-grade debt issuance, and as improved market conditions enabled issuers to pull forward activity, and after a bit of a slow start, ECM picked up in the second half of the quarter, notably in convertibles.\nOur strong performance in both DCM and ECM drove Investment Banking revenue growth of 35% and overall banking revenue growth of 49%. While M&A revenues are still low across the street, I was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter, such as Diamondback's merger with Endeavor Energy and Catalent's merger with Novo Holdings. We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in Q2 in lit of improved market valuations. Corporate sentiment is quite positive, especially in the US, and our clients around the world have very sound balance sheets. We very much look forward to welcoming Vis Raghavan to Citi to lead our banking franchise in early June. Like other new top talent who've joined the firm, he will inject fresh thinking to help us achieve our firm's full potential.\nIn Wealth, while revenues were down in the quarter we grew fees and gathered an estimated $22 billion of net new assets over the past 12 months. As you've seen, Andy continues to form his team and is focused on three areas. First, rationalizing the expense base, second, turning on the growth engine by focusing on investment revenues, and third, enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. Now these won't happen overnight, but getting these things right will help us get more than our fair share of the $5 trillion of assets that our clients have away from us, and that will help us get our returns to where they need to be in this business in the medium term.\nUSPB had double-digit revenue growth for the sixth straight quarter. We feel good about our position and our resiliency as a Prime, lend-centric issuer and are seeing positive momentum across proprietary card and partner card businesses. Healthy spend growth persists in Branded Cards, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Across both portfolios, increased demand for credit continues to drive strong growth in interest-earning balances, and while they're only a small part of our portfolio, we are keeping an eye on the customers in the lower FICO bands. We also continue to see strong engagement in digital payment offerings such as Citi Pay as a point-of-sale lending product which is easily integrated into merchants' checkout processes. We are driving more value from our retail branches as well as getting the spend space right to increase returns there.\nOur balance sheet is strong across the board, an intentional result of our high quality assets, robust capital and liquidity positions, and rigorous risk management. During Q1 we returned $1.5 billion in capital to our common shareholders and that includes $500 million through share buybacks. Our CET1 ratio ticked up to a preliminary 13.5% and we grew our tangible book value per share to $86.67.\nWe have a great franchise around the world with great clients who are served by great colleagues. I'm pleased with where we are and I'm excited about where we're going.\nWith the organizational simplification behind us and a good quarter under our belt, we have started this critical year on the right foot. Now, while there will be bumps in the road, no doubt we will continue to execute with discipline and we are committed to reaching our medium term targets. With that I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we will both be delighted as always to take your questions. Thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nThanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on our year-over-year comparisons for the Q1. Unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On Slide six, we show financial results for the full firm in the Q1, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58, and an ROTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenues.\nTotal revenues were down 2% on a reported basis excluding divestiture related impacts, largely consisting of the billion dollar gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year.\nRevenues were up more than 3% driven by growth across banking, USPB, and Services partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7% on a reported basis excluding divestiture related impacts and the incremental FDIC Special Assessment. Expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and Legacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.8%. On Slide seven we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC Special Assessment of roughly $250 million.\nAlso included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we've incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters. As part of these actions, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run rate saves over the medium term related to a headcount reduction of approximately 7,000.\nIn addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning cost largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm including a reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the transformation this year, and relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation, and volume related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance.\nTherefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in line with our $53.5 to 53.8 billion ex-FDIC expense guidance. On Slide eight we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In Q1 net interest income decreased by $317 million largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4 basis points decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat.\nAverage loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by loans and Spread Products in Markets as well as card and mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services. Average deposits were up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by Services as we continue to grow high quality operating deposits. On Slide nine we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter we adjusted our FICO distribution to be more aligned with the industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 threshold across Branded Cards and Retail Services.\nApproximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher, and we remain well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of nonaccrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans.\nAs a reminder, our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5% which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment.\nTurning to Slide 10, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet which increased 1% sequentially. Despite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets reflecting our continued optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite strategy and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base which is well diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types.\nThe majority of our deposits, $812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we are fully integrated in our clients' systems and help them efficiently manage their operations through our three integrated Services, Payments and Collections, Liquidity Management and Working Capital Solutions, all of which greatly increase the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423 billion are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth at Work as well as across regions and products. Now turning to the asset side, over the last several years we've maintained a strong risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities into high quality assets.\nThis starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio, which is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About 1/3 of our balance sheet is held in cash and high quality short duration investment securities that contribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources.\nFor the quarter we had an LCR of 117%. So to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in our high quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position.\nOn Slide 11 we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA which resulted in a 10 basis point decrease. Finally, the remaining six basis points benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA.\nWe ended the quarter with a preliminary. 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points or over $13 billion above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our current capital requirement does not yet reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation, or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to bring down capital requirements over time.\nSo now turning to Slide 12, before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in Q4 we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking between Banking, Services, and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all other line for each business in our financial supplement.\nIn Services revenues were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income increased 6% driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14% largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS cross-border volumes increased 9%, US dollar clearing volumes increased 3% and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was driven by strong corporate client activity. Securities Services our preliminary assets under custody and administration increased 11%, benefiting from higher Markets valuations as well as new client onboarding.\nThe growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investment in product innovation, the client experience, and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to maintain its number one position with large corporate and FI clients and see good momentum in the commercial client segment. We continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation.\nCost of credit was $64 million as net Credit Losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up 4%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow and Services continues to deliver a high ROTCE of 24.1% for the quarter.\nOn Slide 13 we show the results for Markets, for Q1. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower Fixed Income revenues more than offset growth in equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased 10% driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 21% on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending, and we continue to see good underlying momentum in equities with revenues up 5% driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives, and we continue to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%.\nExpenses increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200 million, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans and Spread Products that impacted reserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8% primarily driven by asset-backed lending and Spread Products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets increased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter.\nMarkets delivered an ROTCE of 10.4% for the quarter. On Slide 14 we show the results for Banking for the Q1. Banking revenues increased 49% driven by growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending, and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously mentioned, Corporate Lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from Investment Banking, Services and Markets. Investment Banking revenues increased 35% driven by DCM and ECM as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly investment grade, which is running at near record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year.\nHowever, in the quarter we participated in the pickup in announced M&A across sectors, including those where we've been investing, such as technology and healthcare. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition.\nThe NCL rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6% as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency as we optimized corporate loan balances. ROTCE was 9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases, and continued expense discipline. On Slide 15, we show the results for Wealth for the Q1. Wealth revenues decreased 4%, driven by a 13% decrease in NII from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs partially offset by higher investment fee revenues, we're seeing good momentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 11% as we benefited from higher investment assets across regions diven by increased client activity as well as market valuations.\nExpenses were up 3%, driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform enhancements, partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reductions as we continue to right size the workforce. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately $200 million, primarily related to a change in estimate as we enhanced our data related to margin lending collateral. Net income was $150 million, end of period client balances increased 6%, driven by higher client investment assets.\nAverage loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued shift of deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform, which more than offset the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net new investment asset flows, and the benefit of higher market valuations.\nROTCE was 4.6% for the quarter. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns of our Wealth business by executing on our three foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time, but over the medium to longer term, we view this as a greater than 20% return business. On Slide 16, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the Q1. US Personal Banking revenues increased 10%, driven by NII growth of 8% and lower partner payments.\nBranded Cards revenues increased 7%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 10% as payment rates continue to moderate, and we continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes of 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Retail Services revenues increased 18% primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as interest earning balance growth of 9%. Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth, and improved mortgage margins.\nExpenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs including repositioning offset by higher volume-related expenses plus the credit of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In Branded Cards the NCL rate came in at 3.65% in line with our expectations. In Retail Services, the NCL rate off 6.32%, was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year, and will likely remain above the range in the Q2, reflecting historical seasonality patterns.\nHowever, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services. This expectation, along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million. Net income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10% as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. ROTCE for the quarter was 5.5%. We recognize that this business is facing a number of headwinds from a regulatory perspective and from higher credit costs given where we are in the credit cycle, both of which are putting pressure on returns for the quarter and for the full year 2024.\nHowever, this doesn't impact our longer term view of the business. We feel good about our position as a prime and lend-centric issuer. We will continue to take mitigating actions to manage through the headwinds, lap the credit cycle, and drive more value from Retail Banking and Retail Services while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business, all of which will ultimately result in a higher returning business over the medium term.\nOn Slide 17 we show results for all Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind downs, as well as higher funding costs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico, and expenses increased 18%. Primarily driven by the incremental FDIC Special Assessment and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses from the wind down and exit Markets. Slide 18 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged.\nWe have accomplished a lot over the past few years, and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure. The year is off to a good start as we are laser focused on executing the transformation and enhancing the business performance. These two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient, agile company, but a client-centric one that brings together the best of Citi to drive revenue growth and improve returns, and we are on the path to reach our 11% to 12% return target over the medium term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will open the floor for questions. If you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself at any time by pressing star five again, and we'll pause for just a moment. Okay. Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Well, you just finished your seven months of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away with $1.5 billion of expense savings. That's, that's very concrete. More generally, after 20, 30, 40 years of matrix structure, down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently. The question that I think a lot of people have is are you simply reporting these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nThank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes not only to the organization model that we have, but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy, it's simplified the bank, it's eliminated needless components, complexity, it's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance. As you can see, it's increased accountability, and very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. Maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive. The first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses, and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer.\nWe brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end to end under the direct management of those five business heads. An example being operations. It's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end to end and total P&L focus. Focus on the bottom line and the returns, driving growth, expense discipline, et cetera. We also right place businesses to align with the strategy. Banking all being under one umbrella, the investment bank, the corporate bank, commercial bank, really helping us drive synergies there, putting F&S and securitization into Markets so that we have a unified spread product there. Also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter. That's an example on the businesses. I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change.\nBy eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies, that enables us to make sure that our countries are focused on change, climate, client delivery, and legal entity management. We've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies, and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined eliminated through the last seven months.\nWe also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters. That allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, et cetera, we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler. The third piece, we created the client organizations so that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm wide to drive revenue synergies. The governance has got a lot easier. It took up a lot of time, and we've given much clearer mandates in. We've more than halved the number of committees, that's 200 committees plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them. The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision making.\nIt's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities, we've eliminated most co-heads, we've reduced matrix reporting, we've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. All of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser focused on being business performance in those five businesses. The transformation already feels different around my table. I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I, and the rest of the team, to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregator layers to get things done.\nWe're done as we said we would be at this point we're wrapping up the final consultation period. Not an easy few months for the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We put a lot of change through the organization, and now as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode again, continuing to drive improvements and simplification in processes and the like. Now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks very much. I think it shows how much you have helped us see the simpler organization. I think people have totally bought into the expense story. So a lot of credit for you guys. I think where I personally and others still have questions on is on the revenue side and getting to those 4% to 5% medium-term targets. So could you take us just conceptually where we're going to where you think you'll drive that growth from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nYou snuck that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this. Pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to banking. So look, we are laser focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium term. And it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium term return targets. In Services we want to continue around the mid-20s in ROTCE. Banking should be getting to around 15%. Markets, 10% to 13%. So we'd like to see at the higher end of that range USPB getting that back to the mid teens and then moving on to the high teens in the medium term. And then lastly as Andy and Mark have talked about getting Wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium term.\nBut the goals to the mid-2020s in the longer term here and we're confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5% CAGR in the medium term. That's a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses, gaining shares in others. We have good client growth. Look at our win rate for example in TTS at over 80%. We've got our commercial bank also bringing in new clients in the mid-market and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world. But Mark, let me pass it over to you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure. Good morning, Glenn. We appreciate the acknowledgment around the expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say we're going to do there. You know, on the revenue line, I'd first point to if you look back since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium term, so that 4% to 5% top line growth. Yes, it was a different rate environment. But that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength. As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-Markets being down modestly.\nSo what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely to play through. The revenue top line being up 3+% but when you look through each of the businesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclosed the revenue, you can see the underlying NIR growth in the bottom left-hand corner of each of those pages that's coming through as well. Securities Services up 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border clearing, commercial cards, but also Securities Services, right?\nWith the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody, we expect that trend to continue with existing clients and more and new clients, as well as how we do more with our commercial middle market business. Excuse me. So NIR growth there, the Investment Banking piece is the other driver of fees. We're seeing that wallet start to rebound. We're part of that rebound. The announced transactions, we're part of those in sectors that we've been investing in, we're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that. And even in Wealth where we're not pleased with the top line performance this quarter down 4%, when you look through that, we do have good underlying NII growth in the quarter in Wealth, and that's up 11% year-over-year.\nAnd it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on, which is investments. And not just in one region but across all the regions. And then finally the USPB piece which is showing good NII growth as well. So the long and short of it is that the 4% growth that's implied in $80 to 81 billion is going to be continued momentum largely in fees, helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium term target.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nSo let me pick up the slack. I'm sure Jen Landis will give the evil eye for sneaking in a second question to Glenn. But let me, let me pick up on banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years really to lay the foundation for growth in banking. North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, healthcare, and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this, defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like, energy, while investing in high growth sectors such as healthcare and technology.\nWith some strong talent, financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion of estimated firepower which they are incentivized to deploy. So they're likely to be between 20% to 30% of global Investment Banking Fees. We've great relationships with this community, we've built that over years and decades. You're going to see us more active in the LevFin space in the right situations for our key clients, and we'll continue to ensure we're well positioned and active around this important opportunity. You'll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class that can be an important source of liquidity for many clients. The middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity. Our investment bank and commercial bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world.\nAnd indeed the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up client-centric strategic coverage across Corporate, Commercial, and Investment Banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I are going to be very laser-focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity. Vis Raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our banking franchise. The momentum that we've been generating with the foundations we've been laying. The intention here from him is to accelerate that. He will focus on increasing our performance intensity, driving productivity and disciplined growth, and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments, fundamentally improving the operating margin, generating higher returns, and that all-important fee revenue.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Yeah, we're almost edging into the afternoon here.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nHi Betsy.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nGreat to hear you Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI guess a couple of questions. Well, I know we talked through the institutional securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the Wealth side because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so it would be useful just to understand the pace or speed or time frame when we should expect to see that start to inflect?\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nYes, absolutely. Some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and Andy's also been taking in the Wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks, and so you'll start, you'll see the impact coming through in our headcount numbers and in Wealth in the expense base next quarter.\nLook, as Mark said in his opening, and Andy's been talking about, this should be a sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business, and he's focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine. He's enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience.\nThe heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're under penetrated. So a lot of the operating efficiency is frankly going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side. Mark, let me pass it over to you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYes, I mean look, I think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of 3% is not yet reflective of the work that Andy has been steadfast at. There are still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important. But I think coming out of the Q1 you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a byproduct of that work. And the work has been across the entire expense base in the Wealth business. So that includes non-client-facing roles and support staff. It includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors.\nAnd those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters. I do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so you can see on some of the metrics on Page 15, the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish low performing or low producing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect in terms of take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of us. So long-winded way of saying there's some operating efficiency upside for us. For sure it's a combination of the top line and the expense work playing through the balance of the quarters and the year here.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay. Good morning, Jane and Mark. Very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth. But you know, revenues are often dictated by the macro, that it's a little bit out of your control. Can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51 to 53. So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, fair to assume you'd be at the very low end of that range, and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, look, I mean the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5. We put that target out there, $51 to 53, as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a good sense of how we expect to get there. With the $2 to $2.5 billion reduction by then, we've already signaled the $1.5 billion that's in front of us. The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range. Obviously the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. Depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top line.\nWith that said, we've got to continue to invest in the transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top. We've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years. We expect for those to continue to drive some top line momentum. But we've got levers in case they don't.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I guess just one question mark around capital. So you talked about $13 million over the Reg minimum. My mind like you could easily be doing 2x the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. Just, I know you don't like to talk about our quarters, but give us a sense of at least this quarter. Should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase, and if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure. Look, you know, and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense. In light of the uncertainty that's out there, we have run at about 13.5 this quarter. That does give us capacity above the 13.3. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve. We want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in Markets or other parts of the franchise. And then there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III Endgame proposal could evolve.\nBut that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized, it's not in place yet. And so we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves. And we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter by quarter basis. But we recognize that there's an opportunity there and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHi, good afternoon. Hey. So, you know, clearly the theme of this that's emerging on the Q and A is, you know, a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in line with the, you know, in light of the expense declines, which, you know, it's not really us analysts. We're sort of a little bit past inheriting what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet jumped into the stock. So to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently than ask a question about card late fees. How are you balancing that? Clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the, into the business, I guess. How are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer? Could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the $80 to 81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation in October.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup",
    "content2": "Yeah, thank you. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long term here. Right. So we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously Jane has recast the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that. But we're playing for the long term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise. It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the transformation, risk, and control spend. And it's why I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there where the returns to do so make sense.\nWe are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer-term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good return returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders. This is, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment, it's an everyday discussion with the teams, frankly. It's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade off on a regular basis in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in.\nIn terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 to 81 billion. The only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of, it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed. Again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nI'd also, just as a reminder, 85% of our auto portfolios are prime. And in CRS where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS. So we want our customers to pay on time with a number of mechanisms to do so. But in terms of the economics, I think we along with the rest of the industry will be putting in mitigating actions over time. Some of which we've already begun to implement.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Mark. I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge offs. You maintain the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on Retail Services. Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year and what kind metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYes. Thanks, John. You know, we have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top line growth, we've seen continued average interest earning balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with.\nWhere we're really seeing the price pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so there the current NCLs are higher than the high end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process. And so I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down. And then I still expect that in 2025 you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges.\nBut look, the reality is that we continue to watch it. The factors that are out there that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates. And those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time. I think the final point I'd make, and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, you know, through the COVID and pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs supported by government stimulus. And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal.\nAnd we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their normal pace. And so these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact. And that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have and, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. On the Branded side, you still expect kind of the peak this year. You're still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025. You could move lower on the Branded charge offs.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in Branded.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit. You know, we did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth. So just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. Obviously, the view on the macro is important. Right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions weighted is about 5%. The downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves will be an important factor. How HPI evolves will be an important consideration here for this portfolio. But also, what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease. Then, the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point.\nAs we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have to continue to build. And so it's why I mentioned on John's question, you know, the importance of looking at, you know, the interest rates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves. But I will say, you know, Ken, as I sit here and think about, you know, what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels. You know, the 8.2% for combined kind of, you know, ACL to loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio. And we'll continue to watch it.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. A separate question on TTS that NII related to TTS has been remarkable with rising rates this quarter. Granted, there was a leap day and there could be currency stuff in there the Q1 that it stepped back. I'm just wondering, like, where is that in its, you know, asset liability sensitivity, the TTS NII and what are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward? Thanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure. Yeah, I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of, you know, some Argentina playing through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying, you know, beta activity. And you know, we have seen, you know, this is a corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen, you know, betas, particularly in the US, you know, at kind of normalized or terminal levels. And playing a bit through that, we are seeing betas outside of the US continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base. But all of that again is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters.\nJust in light of kind of how the rate environments evolved and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on our deposit levels, the last point I'd make on this is we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits. That will be an important, important tailwind that kind of plays through.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina, you've shown $100 million in NII, total net income benefit of $500 million after tax, so probably implying about $5 to 600 of non-interest income benefit. Which line item, sorry, which segment did that come through, and is that sustainable?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina. Devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships, and the primary activities include some of the TTS type of activities that we've talked about. So liquidity management, payments, custody within the Services business. And so you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the Services business, some of it in Markets as well. But again, the majority of the activity in Services.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. As a reminder, can I please remind everyone: just one question per person. Thanks so much. Our next question is from Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey everyone, thanks for taking the question. I think you touched on at least a component of this, a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess I only ask because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories if we potentially go lower in Europe but higher here for a while in the aggregate do these kind of complicate your management, or makes you feel better, or worse about the overall NIM momentum for the company?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, let me try and take it in two pieces. I guess so. One is if I think about how the rate expectations have evolved from the three to six to now, something a little bit north of one in the context of what I expect for our PBWM performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 to 81 billion. And in part that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally backloaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve.\nI mentioned earlier the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our NII line, and so those factors put me in a place where I feel like there'll certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curves evolved, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is. To answer your broader question in terms of kind of how we're positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out. In that 10-K we offer, as we have before, a number of IRE scenarios for ±100 basis points and what it means for our business. If you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate Firm for Citi, US dollar, and non-US dollar that were asset sensitive.\nSo as rates increase, we should see an increase in our NII performance. But if you look at the breakdown, and that's about, I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown.\nWhat the breakdown will show is that for USD at this point we're neutral. So if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue. For the non-USD, we're still quite asset sensitive. Right. And so that should give you some sense of that, and we recognize the limitations with IRE. It assumes, you know, 100 basis points parallel shift across the yield curve, the static balance sheet, et cetera. But that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi Mark. Hi Jane.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nHi Gerard.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nHi Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nMark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card charge offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the corporate side, which obviously is very strong. We've seen spreads narrow in the Markets on high yield corporate debt, leveraged debt, et cetera. It's very robust out there. But around the global geopolitical risk, do you think the spreads will would be widening? Can you guys share with us what you're seeing on the corporate side in terms of competition? Are underwriting standards getting a little weaker now as people are trying to grow their books? What are you seeing on that front?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nLook, we're still seeing, you know, good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that, you know, we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment grade, you know, large multinationals that we, that we serve. And that hasn't, that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit, and that I think will continue to evolve. I think importantly, as we think about our Corporate Lending activity, you'll, and you'll note that actually we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet.\nAnd part of that again is a byproduct of the revenue sharing that we've implemented where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have. And so I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good healthy demand despite continued strong balance sheets. And part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well positioned to be thoughtful about that. But Jane, you may want to add a couple of points to it.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nYeah. Look around the world. The corporate client base and our commercial banking mid-market client base have very healthy balance sheets. We are also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for the quality issuers across all asset classes. We've seen both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors, that deals are well oversubscribed. So that's also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs. The other piece I just pop out there as well is.\nThe recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards. Active discussions are increasing as supportive capital markets create confidence as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing, and some of the higher margin capital markets and lending activity as well. So as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from companies just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can diversifying their capital raising in different quarters. But I just close by saying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these actors.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. In your prepared remarks, you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on Slide 4 here. We're just wondering if you can elaborate on, you know, I guess what you're doing or planning to do differently. On that front, and if there's any meaningful financial impact. Thank you.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, look, I think matters we've talked about many times, the transformations are top priority. It will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium term financial path. And we've been making significant investments behind it as well as not only in the consent order but also making sure we've got this modern, efficient infrastructure. We're currently deep into a very large body of work upgrading our data architecture. Automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium term.\nAs I've said though, there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes, processes, and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need.\nWe keep a close eye on execution, making sure we both got the right level of resourcing and expertise, and we'll invest what we need to do to make sure that we address these different concerns. I can't go into much more detail in terms of CSI obviously, but something of this magnitude you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, and I mean, I think that's exactly right. But you'd also expect that, that in this type of environment, on the heels of the regional bank stress last year, that we're looking at stress scenarios, we're enhancing our CCAR processes, we're enhancing our resolution and recovery processes, all of those to make sure that we're shoring up capabilities and you'd expect that across the industry, quite frankly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Saul Martinez at HSBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi, good afternoon. I'll change tack a little bit here, but I'm curious if there's any update on the Mexican IPO. And more specifically, I'm kind of curious how set in stone the IPO process is. You will have a new administration, and even if it's the candidate from the same party, she may have a less confrontational view of the private sector, perhaps be more allowing of local bank to extract value from buying a bank. You know, I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table? Because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market evaluation could be higher and even materially higher than a public market evaluation.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nThe guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We're well on track on the path in Mexico. We're very pleased to bring Nacho Deschamps in as the Banamex chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year.\nObviously the election's coming up fairly shortly, but we're not anticipating that we would be deviating from the IPO path. That is the path that we are on at the moment. I'll never say never, but we do believe that this is the right one. But we'll keep an eye on what's happening in Mexico as we always do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Chris Kotowski at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon, thanks. Just a quick one for Mark. Previously, you had talked about quote \"bending the cost curve\" between the third and the Q4 of this year. And on this call, I thought I heard you say it's basically been that Q2 should be down, and we should be sequentially lower from here. So did it just happen six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nI'll take it. I'll take that.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nDamn, I wanted that one!\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nI'll take that. A downward. No, I mean I'll take the win. A downward trajectory from here through the end of the year in line with the guidance of $53.5 to 53.8 and so. Yes.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Steven Chubak at Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi good afternoon.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nHello, Steven.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, Jane. Hey, Mark, did want to ask on DFAST and SCB, just recognizing this will be the last opportunity before the results come out. The macro scenario Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year. But just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions which admittedly depressed earnings last year. Want to get a sense as to whether there are any idiosyncratic factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam, and just broader thoughts on the longer term trajectory for the SCB, just given the org simplification efforts are underway.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYes, Steven, the first part of your question is just impossible to answer, to be candid with you. Right. I mean, it's, you know, we obviously have an internal base scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided, you know, a balance sheet as part of the submission. But ultimately, you know, the regulators have to run through their models. The information that we provided and that informs what, what happens with the Stress Capital Buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like, and so really hard to call at this stage.\nThe second part of your question I think is spot on, and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set, and we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy. The evolution of the business mix and the business model, the mix towards more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that will be lower when we get to that medium term period.\nSo all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB score and the like and the freeing up of the capital of which we've already freed up, you know, $6 billion or so. And so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in, and we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the medium term.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. A follow-up, Mark, you said TTS. We said we will have growth and operational deposits, and I was just wondering what gives you such confidence that you will or is that accelerating or the same pace or what?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nWe have seen growth in the quarter in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients as well as the growth we've seen with new clients doing more with existing and more countries more deeply penetrating the commercial middle markets space. And so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also provide the most stickiness as it relates to that relationship. And so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth, including inside this quarter.\n\nJane Fraser\n\nCEO, Citigroup\n\nIt's also a lot of the investments that we've been making fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have market-leading product innovations, and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. Whether it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients. And the stickiness of the deposits and the operating deposits comes with that. So we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike. And the Investor Day in mid-June, which will be, I think we hope, will be very helpful to everyone. So you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money, and see what we call it, a crown jewel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, Mark. A completely different topic, because I think I understood your answer to be just for my previous question to be the tax benefit. So we'll leave it at that. If it is different, then I need to go down that part. But the question I was, I signed on to ask was you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the private label and in the retail partner cards. What is that percentage, and how does it compare with what it was pre-pandemic?\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nYeah, we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that. But we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity, which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound. And so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations, but obviously is a factor in reserve levels, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that, you know, Q1 will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter. And then when we look to Q2 we should, should we still be expecting a step down in Q2 and is that step down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in Q2 as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially Q2, Q4 to hit your annual number or is there a bigger step down in Q2 that I should still be expecting here? Thanks.\n\nMark Mason\n\nCFO, Citigroup\n\nSure. I think you should just fade it to answer your question very directly. But I'd also point out that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it. So when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided. All right. Despite that, I'm telling you the same. I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year. While there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through. So hopefully that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds, and the downward trend is what we are managing towards as we kind of play out the balance of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\n\nJen Landis\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citigroup\n\nThank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please call us. We look forward to talking to you. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Citi Q1 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect."

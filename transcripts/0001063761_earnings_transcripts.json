For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request and limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nGood evening. Yeah, I'm obviously pleased with our financial and operational performance for the Q3. Our results were driven by solid fundamentals, higher occupancy, accelerating shopper traffic, strong retail sales, and a positive supply and demand dynamics, all contributing to strong cash flow growth. We are pleased to have acquired the remaining interest in Taubman Realty Group that we didn't know and are excited about the opportunities to enhance the operational efficiency and increase the NOI from the assets and deliver long-term returns to our shareholders.\nI want to thank Bobby and Billy Taubman, and the entire TRG team for our successful partnership over the last five years. I'm now going to turn it over to Eli, who will discuss the terrific TRG transaction and update on our development activity, and Brian will cover our Q3 results and other various goodies. There you go, Eli.\n\nEli Simon\n\nDirector, EVP, and COO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you. As mentioned, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 12% interest in TRG that we did not previously own in exchange for 5.06 million limited partnership units. We are pleased with the outcome having acquired these high-quality assets at an overall cap rate of over 7.25%, not taking into account any operational efficiencies and improvements. These iconic assets further enhance the quality of our overall portfolio, and we are now in a position to pursue new growth and value creation opportunities for this portfolio.\nThe portfolio has strong operating metrics, including 94.2% occupancy, average base minimum rent of $72.36 per sq ft, and retailer sales of approximately $1,200 per sq ft. This transaction will be accretive in 2026 as we assume management responsibilities and integrate the assets with the full benefit realized in 2027, given all of the operational aspects of running on our platform, adding at least 50 basis points to the going-in overall yield. TRG will be consolidated, and the acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination.\nThis will require remeasurement of our previously held equity interest to fair value, resulting in a really big non-cash, non-FFO gain to be recognized in the Q4 of 2025. Now turning to development. In the Q3, we began construction on several new projects, including a second phase of residential at Northgate Station, an expansion of The Westin Austin at The Domain, retail and experiential additions at Brea Mall, King of Prussia, and The Shops at Mission Viejo.\nAt quarter end, our share of the net cost of development projects across all platforms was $1.25 billion, with a blended yield of 9%. Approximately 45% of net costs are for mixed-use projects. In addition, our new development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow, with exciting new opportunities ahead, including a major full-price retail and mixed-use project in Nashville, where we will be unveiling our vision later this week. I'll now turn it over to Brian, who will walk through our Q3 results.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Eli. Real estate FFO was $3.22 per share in the Q3 compared to $3.05 in the prior year, 5.6% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good Q4 and contributed $0.26 of growth, driven by an 8% increase in lease income. As anticipated, lower interest income and higher interest expense combined were a $0.09 drag year over year.\nDomestic NOI increased 5.1% year over year for the Q4 and 4.2% for the first nine months of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 5.2% for the Q4 and 4.5% for the first nine months. Retailer demand remains strong as we signed over 1,000 leases, totaling approximately 4 million sq ft during the Q4. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity represents new deals, reflecting continued strong demand across the portfolio.\nThe malls and premium outlets ended the Q3 at 96.4% occupancy, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year over year. The mills achieved a 99.4% occupancy, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points from the prior year. Average base minimum rents increased 2.5% year over year for the malls and the premium outlets, while the mills saw a 1.8% increase. Retailer sales per square foot for the malls and the premium outlets were $742 for the Q4.\nImportantly, total sales volumes increased more than 4% in the Q3. Shopper traffic and retailer sales accelerated sequentially, reflecting the impact of a successful back-to-school season. Occupancy cost at the end of the Q4 was stable at 13%. Q3 funds from operations were $1.23 billion, or $3.25 per share, compared to $1.07 billion, or $2.84 per share last year. Some of the increase was due to improvement in OPI compared to last year. Please see the FFO reconciliation in our supplemental today for details on the year-over-year changes in FFO per share.\nTurning to the balance sheet and liquidity, during the Q4, we completed a dual tranche US Senior Note offering that totaled $1.5 billion at a combined average term of 7.8 years and a weighted average coupon rate of 4.8%. During the first nine months of the year, we completed 33 secured loan transactions totaling approximately $5.4 billion. The weighted average interest rate on these loans was 5.38%. We ended the Q4 with approximately $9.5 billion of liquidity.\nTurning to our dividend, today we announced $2.20 per share for the Q4, a year-over-year increase of $0.10, or 4.8%. The dividend is payable on 31 December. Now turning to guidance, we are increasing our full year 2025 real estate FFO guidance range to $12.60 to 12.70 per share. This compares to $12.24 last year and our prior guidance range of $12.45 to 12.65 per share. The updated range reflects a $0.15 increase at the low end and a $0.10 increase at the midpoint. Thank you. We are now available for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the opportunity for operational efficiencies and improvement for the Taubman assets twice, and that these should help improve the yield by 50 basis points. So can you share some of the specifics of the opportunity from bringing these assets fully onto your platform?\n\nEli Simon\n\nDirector, EVP, and COO, Simon Property Group\n\nCan you get on your phone? We should always have a backup on your phone.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHello.\n\nOperator\n\nHi, we're able to hear you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. We got disconnected. So can you repeat the question? We didn't get it all.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, absolutely. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the opportunity for operational efficiencies and improvements for the Taubman assets twice, and that these should help improve the yield by 50 basis points. So can you share some of the specifics of the opportunity from bringing these assets onto your platform?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I mean, when we bought the original 80% of Taubman, the only real operational efficiencies we got was eliminating public company cost. Obviously, they had a full operational team running those assets, and we'll be able to add them to our platform at very little cost. And then from an operational enhancement point of view, we bring our expertise in development, redevelopment, leasing, marketing, brand ventures, and we put all that together, and that's what we do for a living.\nSo we've helped out, but not to the point of how we would if we actually ran the properties day to day. So now we bolt them onto our platform. That's easy. And then we run the properties day to day, and we bring all that we can bear to a portfolio like that. And that's where we see a tremendous amount of upside. Look at the occupancy. It's lower than where we're at, and we think we can bring it up to our level. And then we've got all our asset management techniques, property management capabilities that are going to just grind higher cash flow. That's what we do for a living.\nThat's why we've been the acquirer. That's why we've been successful time and again. If you look back at this portfolio and you look at the entire transaction, we're going to be at essentially an eight-cap rate when we add these little over eight-cap rate when we add the assets to our platform. You look at the quality of the assets, that makes for a terrific deal, which you guys need to understand. It's at a much higher cap rate than strip centers or trading, much better growth rate than strip centers or trading that I've seen. These assets have been around 70 years.\nThat's the other thing to step back. Take data centers. Data centers trade at a 4.5-cap rate, and we don't know, nobody knows, what they're going to look like in five years. What we do know is that good malls have been around 70 years. 70 years. Not 7 years, not 17 years, but 70 years. So we made a hell of a trade, and that's certainly one of the reasons why I think the Taubmans wanted to convert this last 12% into our units, which is convertible on a one-to-one basis to our stock, because they've seen our ability to execute and perform at levels that no one else has in our peer group.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much. Good luck in the Q4.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Be excited.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nWe are.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAll right. Good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey. Good afternoon out there. And Eli, welcome to the public earnings call. Thank you. So you now get all the enjoyment that David has had over the years. So David, just going back to the cap rate, and if you'll indulge me a little bit, if we take the implied cap rate of the shares issued on Friday, it's sort of a little over a 6%, but you spoke about an 8%, which sounds like the existing assets were producing a lot more, the overall versus the final buyout trade.\nBut then you spoke about the initial 50 basis points increase once at Taubman's platform, but presumably there's a lot more growth over the next five or so years that presumably that 8% goes higher. So one, can you help us understand sort of the pricing of the final 12 and how that relates to the 7.25 that you initially spoke about? And then over the next few years, presumably this cap rate's going to be much higher than an 8%.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. So let me just unpack it a little bit. I'll be a little more clear. So if you look at, we had four transactions within the Taubman Group. We had the initial 80%, we had the two 4%, and then the 12%. If you look at that on today's numbers, that's basically a little over a 7.25 cap rate. If you add what we think will bring in operational synergies, efficiencies, slash enhancements, that's where we get to north of 8. And then obviously, Alex, you're right.\nThen you have all the intrinsic growth of the portfolio, which we're not; that'll just be year-after-year growth because I think these assets, by and large, have a higher skew of quality than just the Simon-only portfolio. So they skew a little higher growth than we did historically. So we would expect our top-line growth to accelerate because of adding that in. So hopefully that unpacks. If you really are focused on the 12%, not including the operational enhancements, we're in the 6.25% to 6.5% cap rate if you just want to focus on that 12%. Okay?\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nRight.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nDid I help explain it?\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. It's what we thought initially, but obviously all the pieces adding up to get us how you think about it.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI told you a lot more only because it's you I told you a lot more information than I normally would. Okay?\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nI'm sure Floris will ask a lot more details than I have, so I'll stand back. So thank you for your thank you, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Bye.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi everyone. Congrats on the quarter, and recent announcements, and yes, welcome, Eli, to the earnings call. Maybe on the sales results, they increased in the quarter, which was great to see. Could you give any detail on how widespread that was? Did a couple of tenants drive numbers one way or the other? I know you have initiatives to upgrade the tenant base, maybe shrink the reserves where it makes sense. So just whether we're starting to see some impact from those initiatives?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nHi, Caitlin. It's Brian. Quite honestly, throughout the quarter, you saw a widespread increase across all three platforms. The tenant base certainly was productive in the quarter. You saw certain categories outperform. You saw luxury come back a bit. Certainly, athleisure outperform, even the apparel category. Certainly, the back-to-school season was a robust one for our business and our portfolio. Even, you saw some positive inflection in some of the tourist-oriented centers.\nSo we are starting to see it kind of widespread across the totality of the portfolio, sequential improvement, both in traffic and in sales.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Caitlin, I would only add that I think, like I said last quarter, I believe we're still not, from a sales point of view, hitting on all cylinders. What we did see is that kind of the higher-end consumer, obviously. I don't have to; you have as good data as we do at Goldman. But clearly, we're in this K-shaped kind of situation. So we did skew better results in the higher-income-oriented centers. The value-oriented centers were more flat to kind of eking along. So you didn't see the entire portfolio. Brian's right.\nThe border was okay, at least stabilized. So it's not hitting on all cylinders, but it's okay. Florida remains to be very strong. The one area that we're seeing, and I think everybody's seeing, is that Las Vegas, from a tourist market, is underperforming. You see it from the casinos. Obviously, we have a lot of properties, great properties, but they're not comping the sales growth that we would expect. And then Brian is right. We did see stabilization in the luxury, which is good. And again, the higher-income properties are doing better.\nThe one caveat is, as you know, our Vegas properties skewed toward that, and their comp sales were in fact, I think, a little down. I don't have the number off the top of my head. So we're seeing underperformance. Look, we don't worry about that because Vegas assets are great, and Vegas does go up and down. You've clearly had Canadians that don't go to Las Vegas and other people that are not going at the frequency that's happening. No concern there. Right now, it's kind of been a trough.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Samir Khanal with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nSamir Khanal\n\nDirector of US REITs, Bank of America\n\nHi. Good evening, everybody. Brian or David, you've generated a very strong NOI growth here to date, 5% for the quarter. I guess given the solid leasing environment you're seeing, just trying to see if you can keep up this sort of same-story momentum in 2026 or even do better, assuming a sort of a similar retailer sales environment. Curious on your thoughts. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, the team is doing our I think we invite Alex on here, right? So we invite you and then disinvite you. But the team is going through the property-by-property root canal. Okay? So I'm glad to report no cavities, no need for root canal. We feel really, what I'm being told and what I'm seeing from the numbers, really positive. The team is juiced, energized. So I'm not going to give you a number, but we feel really good about 2026 in terms of our ability to produce comp NOI growth. As you know, we'll do that in February with our earnings guidance.\nBut the team is feeling good that we'll have another, obviously, there's external factors that even we don't control. I'm kidding. But we're feeling really generally positive about what we're seeing. Right, Brian?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. No, that's the report back. We're in the middle of grinding out. We'll get back to you in February, but I think there's an optimism.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Eli, you've been going through all these.\n\nEli Simon\n\nDirector, EVP, and COO, Simon Property Group\n\nYep. It's across the portfolio, not just the powerhouse centers, but really across the portfolio. A lot of exciting new things in store for next year.\n\nSamir Khanal\n\nDirector of US REITs, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\n\nGreg McGinnis\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHey. Good evening. From our perspective, and despite our expectations, tariffs have had seemingly little impact on shopper or retailer behavior to date. And David, I know you previously mentioned that maybe the holiday season is when we start to see some impact to retailer financials, but we were hoping for an update on what you're seeing in your retailer discussions, and regarding your expectations on any impact to leasing and/or tenant behavior.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nFrom the tariffs. Right? So look, I think the news that President Trump and President Xi had on the Chinese discussion is positive for our retailers, even though a number of them have moved some of their production out of China. But that's a positive. I continue to believe that tariffs will have an impact. We have not yet seen all of it. And I think some of that will, as I said last time, I mean, it's a pretty consistent story. Some of that will be passed on to the supplier. Some of that will be eaten by the retailer, and some of that will be passed on to the consumer.\nSo there's just, in many cases, the inability for retailers to eat that entire tariff. So they're going to have to pass it on or renegotiate better vendor deals. And I still believe we still haven't seen the full impact of it. So I think your question is appropriate. I think it's still now, baseball goes to, what is it, 18 innings now? Is that what you're talking about? I mean, okay, 18 innings. So let's assume it goes to straight nine. I think the tariff, if I had to put an ending on it, I'd say five or six. I mean, it's just a gut feel, so it's not scientific.\nSo we'll have to see. And I do worry that it will put more pressure on the smaller retailers or not the mammoth retailers that we all think about, right? Because they have the ability to handle it and try and use this as an opportunity to squeeze and increase market share. So we're still in the middle of the game. It ain't over. Hopefully, it is a nine-inning game. It doesn't go to 18.\nBut I don't think the final chapter, how about all these analogies. But I don't think the final chapter has been written. So we're still cautious on that. Let me just end by saying, from a supply and demand point of view, just from our leasing, we see absolutely unequivocally no change apart from the retailers that are looking to grow their footprint.\n\nGreg McGinnis\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, guys. David, maybe going back to your comments earlier about the value mall, kind of the foot traffic going on there versus your near-end mall. As you look at 2026, I know you guys said you feel very good. But in the tenant demand, as you guys approach conversations with tenants who are looking at both high-end and kind of the value segment from some of that crossover, do you feel like you guys are losing a little bit of momentum in the ability to push net effectives at the value side of the portfolio?\nOr has the inflation over the last couple of years just pushed OCRs to a point where you still feel like you're able to get pretty good upside relative to maybe where you're pushing into luxury or the higher-end malls?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Let me just say, traffic for the kind of the value-oriented centers is up. So it's not the traffic. It's just really the conversion. I think that consumer is being a little more cautious. But I think you pinpointed. I mean, we have low OCRs there. The demand, again, the retail demand on that portfolio is still very positive. So, no change, no different point of view. But we do have to be sensitive because the lower-income consumer, which, again, we don't skew to, even in our outlet centers, they're skewed toward the higher-end retailers or the higher-end consumers, I should say.\nSo it's not where we skew. But again, demand is good, and it's not that there's really no change of mood or potential there. But it is. Sales are not moving as they're not increasing at the rate that the full-price better higher-end centers are. That's it. So I think that the outlet consumer is being a little more cautious. But let's see what happens this Christmas. I mean, you still got things going for the lower-end consumer, lower gas price, hopefully lower electricity prices for the time being until all these data centers get built.\nAnd that's another interesting thing we need to talk about as a country. But I think, again, we're just the sales are not hitting like Vegas, like a couple of the northern borders. We're just not hitting on all cylinders. And the reason we say that is to show you that there's more juice in the orange, right? Is it orange or lemon? Orange. I'd rather say orange. Orange. Orange. Okay. Yeah. Lemon sounds good, right? So there's more juice there. It's just we're not getting all of it at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Griffin with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Griffin\n\nDirector of REIT Equity Research Team, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks. I wanted to ask on the new leasing in the quarter. Brian, I think you mentioned it was about 30% of the total leases executed. Is this y'all proactively looking to get ahead of leases that might expire in a year or two and upgrade the credit quality? And can you also give us a sense if you're seeing more of those new-to-mall concepts coming in the portfolio? And lastly, anything you can comment on leasing spread for that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I'll just let Brian answer most of it. But I'll say the new-to-mall concepts. I mean, Netflix is opening the store. We're in discussions with them. Google's opening stores. We're in contact with them. Netflix, Eli's going to the opening tomorrow at King of Prussia. Is it next week? Next week. So Netflix, I encourage everyone to go check it out. They're opening their flagship destination store at King of Prussia next week. So there's more and more Labubu? Labubu?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Pop Mart, Edikted, Princess Polly, a bunch of tenants. And what they see is they can open a bunch of stores with us. And so we're having really great conversations in our new business leasing.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSo I'll let Brian get to the rest. But so the new idea, new experiential stuff, we're doing new Apple stores as well. They opened in Del Amo as a good example. We've been working that deal for five years or so. So I think it's very encouraging what we're seeing on the new storefront. We're still doing a lot of new restaurants with high-end operators. So that's going very well. We opened Formula 1 at Forum Shops, one of their second or third operations, two-level flagship store, a bunch of people there for the opening. It's terrific. Saw pictures.\nSo just on the new concept, the new storefront between the restaurants and the Meta's of the world, the Netflix, the Googles, that we're all working on that, I think it's very, very positive. Very positive. So lots happening on that front.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nAnd Michael, the 30% statistic is new leases. So it is not picking up old stuff. What you've got is just the unabated demand for us to continue to add interesting and new uses. We're also seeing big demand from the existing kind of retailer base, and we're slightly out ahead of 2026's expirations. And so I think it's coming from a variety of places. Certainly, on the last several calls, you've heard us talk about improving the merchandising mix. And that 30% statistic is really encapsulating our desire and ability to do that. And I'll give you a simple example. We have a great mall.\nI probably shouldn't, yeah. I'm not going to name the tenant, but I'll give you some breadcrumbs. But it's a great mall in a great southeastern city, a great southeastern city, not Atlanta. That's a great southeastern city, but another great southeastern city, not Atlanta, that we're, and this goes to your point. Even if you have a lease, are you satisfied? The answer is no. So we're taking one tenant that has a lease. We're actually downsizing them, moving them to another space, and putting a leading high-end retailer in there.\nI'll leave it at that. I was going to give you a little bit more breadcrumbs, but I don't want people yelling at me. So which is a good example of even though we had leases on both spaces, we're taking one, downsizing one tenant, moving, bringing in another one. And that's what our folks do. That's one of the great things that we see in the TRG portfolio. We'll be a lot more aggressive in doing that because we should never be satisfied that we've executed the mix at the rate that you've always got to change it. For instance, talk Forum Shops. I think it just recently opened.\nWe had an H&M store there. We replaced it with Zara. Beautiful store. Big investment that they had. And that changes the whole kind of the Center Court. They're familiar with the asset, which is truly exciting. So absolutely. And that's one of the, like I said, one of the interesting things that we see in the TRG portfolio. And then in our assets across the spectrum, whether it's the outlet centers or the full-price malls.\n\nMichael Griffin\n\nDirector of REIT Equity Research Team, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, good afternoon. I was hoping maybe to talk a little bit about technology. A lot of things in society seem like they're in flux, and retail is not excluded there. Talk about ChatGPT agents or agentic agents that can do some of the shopping, bypassing people. Just curious on how you guys are trying to position for this and your thoughts on how this may evolve and if you see it as a risk or an opportunity or both.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, you have to assume everything's a risk. So I do think bringing AI into the equation will have a pretty big impact on how e-commerce is done. But we offer something much broader than e-commerce. If e-commerce was going to put us out of business for the last 20 years, and here we are standing. Just to give you an example, I saw Palantir had EBITDA this quarter of adjusted EBITDA, whatever that means, of $400 million. Our EBITDA this quarter was $1.6 billion. So now Palantir's market cap is $500 billion, and ours is $65 billion if you include the units, right?\nSo that's pretty good math, right? So again, I do think the people that shop, the e-commerce shoppers, are definitely going to use AI tools to eventually use AI to replace the way they shop online today. And the key for us is to create like we have for 70 years. Remember, we've been in this business 70 years, okay? Not 5, not 20. But we have survived. This product has survived 70 years.\nI will tell you, our half-life is greater than the newfangled data centers that are being built today because I think they'll figure out how to do them smaller and more efficient three to five years from now, okay? And I know nothing, but that's my gut feel. I know nothing, but that's my gut feel. So going back to your question, so it will have an impact on e-commerce. I think it's going to absolutely continue to make us great at what we do in that we're going to have to create real shopping, holistic shopping environments.\nAnd another way to look at it is, look, so there's a lot of talk about going to, and I was at this CEO summit the other day, which was kind of interesting. But put that aside. There's a lot of talk that people are going to be working three days a week. And the potential GDP impact of AI could be $15 trillion or trillions of dollars, right? So the way I look at it, I look at it actually positive. So let's say we all work, now, I'm going to still work five days, eight days a week, right? Or I'm going to make work at least seven, eight days a week.\nBut let's just hypothetically take the point that it's only three days a week work, okay? Three days a week that you work. You're going to have a lot more free time. We've created this great wealth. Our GDP goes from $18 trillion to 25 to 30 trillion. That means money in people's pocket. I think they're going to go to the mall to shop. What else are they going to do? Okay? So they can only yell at their kids that much when they play huge soccer. So they're going to go to the mall to shop, spend their newfound wealth that's going to eat through this economy.\nNow, what we have to do is just create these great environments. And ultimately, we'll use AI like everybody else to enhance our loyalty, to enhance our shop sign-in, to enhance our search effort, to connect with the consumer. And we'll talk to ChatGPT and ask them, \"What would her or it, whatever, what would you do to the mall to make it better and do all this stuff?\" But I'm looking at it positively. We lasted 70 years. We're only going to work three days a week. We're going to create $12 trillion of value. And people are going to go to the mall to shop.\nBecause what else are they going to do? Okay? You see what I'm saying? Yes. Hopefully. Okay. So in any event, but we're experimenting how to do it. We've got a friend called Harvey that we may create the first AI CEO. Now, I'm not saying he's going to replace me, but he could replace one of our divisions or elsewhere. So stay tuned. We'll use it effectively like we've used everything else.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Industrial and Mall Research, Green Street\n\nHi, good evening. I wanted to follow up more time on the Taubman cap rate. Just specifically, if you, like the way I'm looking at it is the purchase price is just over $1.5 billion if we use Friday's close for the OP unit value plus incremental debt. Trailing 12-month NOI is right around $77 million for 12% of Taubman using your supplemental. So that's more like a low 5% cap rate on a trailing 12-month basis. So I mean, is it really that much synergies to get to the Q3?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, we told you the numbers. Vince, at this point in our career, we're not going to mislead you or the public. Your cap rates are too low for certain assets, but not too high for ours. We told you where the cap rates are. We told you where the accretion is. We told you everything there is to tell you about that deal. They've had a lot of growth this year. They've got growth next year. We've told you everything there is to tell you. I will tell you, I think your cap rates for our asset base is too high.\nI think your peers at Green Street have a product that is too low compared to ours. Our growth is better. And the longevity of our asset base, we don't factor in that our assets last 70 years. Okay?\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Industrial and Mall Research, Green Street\n\nNo, that's fair. All right. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nManaging Director and Senior REITs Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking my question, David. Good to hear from you. Eli, welcome to the call. My question is on corporate structure. Congrats on the internalization of the remaining part of TRG, but I'm curious if there are any changes or shifts in how you're thinking about your investment in your European platform, Klépierre. Earlier this year, you bought an asset in Italy off-balance sheet outside of Klépierre. So I guess I'm curious if you're happy to own more assets outside of Klépierre.\nBut then I also wanted to add, it seemed like recently you opted to convert some of the Klépierre exchangeable note holders into stock, not cash, which might suggest you have a longer-term hold for that stock. So maybe help us reconcile those two dynamics and how you're thinking about the Klépierre platform. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, we bought the mall, which has nothing to do with the, which is a luxury outlet center in Italy too. It's actually on balance sheet. It's on balance sheet. Yeah. Right. No, I saw that. Yeah. So that has nothing to do with Klépierre. Klépierre, look, it's been a great investment for us. We evaluate it all the time. We did get some, as you know, we issued the convert, did we do it three years ago? Three years ago. We got conversion notice. We did settle in shares.\nAnd we looked and evaluated that investment continually, and we'll continue to do that. But it's been a very good investment. We've added a lot of value to that organization. I think, again, the market should appreciate. We're Klépierre. Go back. Let's turn the clock back. Ten years ago, where Klépierre was, and look at where it is today. And our strategic input, vision, and guidance created the new Klépierre that exists today. That's a position to succeed in European full-price retailer with the best.\nAnd that's all, I mean, again, the management team did a great job, but we hired the management team, okay? So at the same time, we have a fiduciary duty to continue to add value to Klépierre while we're on the board. While we're on the board, at the same time, we have a fiduciary duty to our Simon shareholders to look at all of our investments to see if that's the best allocation of our capital, and we will continue to do so.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nManaging Director and Senior REITs Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nI appreciate that, David. I guess I just wanted to clarify because I mentioned the asset in Italy you bought because you bought it on balance sheet and not in Klépierre. So I guess I was curious if you were happy owning more assets outside of Klépierre in Europe. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. We would probably, okay, I'm sorry if I misunderstood. So we would probably only look to, we've kind of decided that the full price, again, this could always change, right?\nBut we've kind of decided that if there are full-price assets to acquire while we continue to hold our Klépierre investment and sit on the board, that Klépierre would do that. On the other hand, if it's in the outlet world, because we look at outlets worldwide, we have outlets in Asia, obviously North America, both in Mexico, Canada, US, obviously, several countries in Asia, that we would look at those for our own accounts, the Simon accounts. Okay. I'm sorry I misunderstood your question.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nManaging Director and Senior REITs Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. So Taubman's used a secured debt strategy for the portfolio ever since the 1998 restructuring. Do you think you'll be unencumbering a number of those assets over time? And as a follow-up, are there any parts of that portfolio that look like they're sale candidates today?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nHi, Mike it's Brian. You're right. They did go to a secured strategy over time. I would expect that over time we will unlock that and use our unsecured capital to unencumber assets and of course to further improve our unencumbered asset base, which is already incredibly powerful. As far as the portfolio on balance today, I think we're comfortable where it sits, but we naturally evaluate things frequently. So that could change over time. But for now, I think we're in a good place.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you. Thank you, Mike.\nOur next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. It's Adam on for Ron. I think we had always looked at the dividend sort of post-COVID as I think you guys are sort of targeting getting back to that pre-COVID dividend level. You're now past that.\nSo I guess just sitting here today, how do you sort of stack rank the capital allocation priorities? I know you've talked about sort of development of obviously the class A assets, but also I think you've talked in recent quarters about some of the class B or B-plus development opportunities or redevelopment opportunities as well. So just sitting here, the different options in terms of capital allocation, how do you sort of stack rank those: dividend buybacks, potentially development, redevelopment, etc.?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nActually, thank you for, i think, I forgot we passed our COVID dividend. We did?\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe did.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAll right. Good. Good work, guys. Well done. So look, I think one of the things that you'll probably—we do have a buyback open, right? Obviously, you can't buy back now. But one of the things you'll see from us most likely, which is not in the numbers, but we issued 5 million unit shares. So we'll look to quarterize that over. We have a balance sheet that does not need to issue equity. So now, as part of the deal, Taubman family really wanted units, equity.\nSo I think over time, obviously subject to market conditions, we'll look to quarterize, i.e., at least want to get our share level back to kind of where it was pre-issuance for the TRG deal. Now, that's subject to market conditions. We'll be very smart about it. I can do everything else. So that has moved up the. I still think we're going to want to grow our dividend. And obviously, I think I said last time, the development stuff does take time to put the capital to work.\nWe don't move as fast as these data centers. It just goes up nine months. But I think quarterizing that 5 million issuance has moved up to the top of the charts. But that does not mean that the capital redeployment in the portfolio slows down. You're rightly pointing out that we all get in these classifications, A-, B, B+. We're going to put it where the capital is accretive to that property value. We don't use Green Street cap rates. We use David Simon's cap rates. And over my career, I've been more right than wrong.\nSo we could do a ChatGPT poll of who's got the better cap rates. I'm going to go with David for the time being, but I've been proven wrong. So we're blowing and going, and we've got some really exciting big things on the horizon to do with capital, just to name a few. We bought out Seratage at Boca, which is a huge, massive thing to a great center, which should be a 4.5 cap rate. But don't worry, we're not going to. Our development yield is going to be greater than that, much greater than that. But we've got Fashion Valley. We've got Boca.\nWe've got Barton Creek. These are just two or three that are popping. Later in the week, the team will be announcing a really landmark deal in Nashville, a great site in a great city that we have a very important presence in, now complemented by the TRG asset that we now have full operational control with, which is a very good asset, and Opry Mills as an example, which is a very good mall and a distinct trade area. So that'll be our new ground-up development that we're really excited about.\nSo it's pretty much status quo other than we're going to be moving up the. I don't want another 5 million shares out there. Okay?\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the time. Appreciate it.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Thank you. We're going to run a little bit over. We got two more questions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director and Senior REIT Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. I know we're running late.David, great to hear your voice. Eli, again, I'll not be the first one to welcome you, but good to have you on the call as well. And David, I love your passion. Question for you. I'll try to keep it relatively short here, but your S&O pipeline, could you talk about that? And I note that Kering has dropped out of your top 10 tenants list. Presumably, they haven't closed any stores. Is that just you haven't signed new leases, or they haven't opened new stores in the portfolio?\nAnd maybe talk a little bit about, in that S&O, how your luxury is trending or how you expect that to trend, maybe.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nHey, Floris. It's Brian. So the S&O pipeline is 310 basis points as of 30 September. And you're right. Kering did drop out of the top 10. It's just simply because we opened up more stores with other retailers and forced them above the Kering ranking. So it's really a reflection of the robust activity that's on the ground from a leasing perspective. Kering is still a very important tenant, and over time, we would expect to continue to see them move around in the top rankings. As you look at that 310 basis points, there is a substantial amount of luxury in there.\nIt's probably to the tune of about 50 to 60 basis points of the total 310. So the luxury cohort of tenants continues to favor our portfolio and continue to see growth with us.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director and Senior REIT Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nThanks, Brian.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAnd again, we've got, you know, we're occupancy is pretty high, but a lot of this new stuff is re-tenanted. And obviously, Forever 21 is having, releasing all that space is having an impact on the S&O, right?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director and Senior REIT Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nThanks.\n\nDavid Brown\n\nCompany Representative, Aiera\n\nThank you, Floris.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nOmotayo Okusanya\n\nManaging Director and Head of US REIT Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking my call. Eli, congratulations. Welcome aboard. In regard to OPI, just curious what you guys are, how you're thinking about that business again because it's a little bit more value-oriented. I'm just kind of curious if there's opportunities to kind of monetize that, or is just the world too murky right now to really have an opportunity?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group",
    "content2": "Well, we'll see how that transpires, but I will compliment the team at SPARC Group. They're doing really terrific work at a number of the brands. Not all, some of the brands are, again, it's not perfect sailing there, but they're doing a great job at JCPenney, great job at Aéropostale, a great job at Brooks Brothers, a really good job at Lucky Brand.\nSo we've been very pleased with how SPARC Group has integrated the various brands that that merger is really, this is the first nine months. If you go back, it really happened in early 2025. So they're doing a terrific job. It's stable. Good results. Obviously, out of Forever 21, which was as much as we tried to save it, we couldn't primarily because of the de minimis. And now that we would have had a fighting chance had we not suffered from the de minimis, but we couldn't overcome that.\nNow, thankfully, it's changed, and at least it puts domestic retailers on an even footing with certain foreign retailers. So long story short, SPARC Group is doing a terrific job. And like everything else, look, if I would say we'll always look at what the best options are, but for the time being, it's in good stead. Again, a few of the brands skew towards the lower income. I will say this: the lower income and the higher income as well is they're looking for value.\nValue is in the eye of the beholder, but you got to give the consumer today value, whether they're a high-income consumer or a lower-income consumer. Value is the name of the game. I think SPARC Group has recognized that and are providing it at a high end, like it's at Brooks Brothers, and it's kind of the more moderate at Aero and Penn. So it's all good.\n\nOmotayo Okusanya\n\nManaging Director and Head of US REIT Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nWell said, David. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference over to David Simon for closing remarks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. We had a very active quarter. We're going to have a very active Q4.More good stuff to come. Thank you very much for your interest and your questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."

I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Tom. Good evening everyone. We're off to a good start for 2025 with results that exceeded our plan. We completed the acquisition of the mall luxury outlets in Florence and San Remo, Italy, and opened our first outlet in Jakarta, Indonesia. We continue to enhance our retail real estate platform through development, redevelopment, and acquisitions.\nOur A-rated fortress balance sheet with over $10 billion in liquidity sets us apart, and we have the lengthy track record of adapting our capital allocation and operating strategy to confront and take advantage of diverse macroeconomic cycles. Now I'm going to turn it over to Brian who will cover our first quarter results and we'll take it from there.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, David, and good evening. Real Estate FFO was $2.95 per share in the first quarter compared to $2.91 in the prior year. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.14 of growth, driven by a 5% increase in leased income as anticipated. Interest income, land sales, and lease settlements were $0.10 lower year over year. We signed 1,300 leases for more than 5.1 million soft in the quarter.\nApproximately 25% of leasing activity for the quarter were new deals, and approximately 80% of the leases expiring through 2025 are complete ahead of last year at this point in time. Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy at the end of the quarter was 95.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. The Mills occupancy was 98.4%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year.\nAverage base minimum rents for the malls and outlets increased 2.4% year over year, and the mills increased 3.9%. Mall and Premium Outlet retailer sales per square foot was $7.33 per foot for the quarter. Occupancy cost at the end of the quarter was 13.1%. Driving domestic NOI, which increased 3.4% year over year for the quarter, and portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.6% for the quarter.\nQ1 Funds From Operations were $1.0 billion or $2.67 per share compared to $1.33 billion or $3.56 per share last year. As a reminder, the prior year results include $0.81 per share in after-tax net gains primarily from the sale of the company's remaining ownership interest in ABG. Q1 results include a $0.17 per share loss primarily from the non-cash unrealized mark-to-market and fair value adjustments on the Klépierre exchangeable bonds.\nThis is offset by a $0.07 gain on the sale of securities. The non-cash loss on the derivative is due to the outperformance of Klépierre stock price, which increased 11% in the first quarter. The Q1 also includes an after-tax loss of $0.05 per share related to Catalyst branch restructuring costs. Turning to our development activities at the end of the quarter, development projects were underway across all platforms with our share of the net cost of $944 million and a blended yield of 9%.\nApproximately 40% of net costs are mixed-use projects. We expect to begin construction on additional projects in the coming months, including a residential development at Brea Mall and new retail, dining, and outdoor spaces at The Shops at Mission Viejo, both in Orange County, California, as well as the redevelopment of a former department store at The Fashion Mall at Keystone in Indianapolis into dynamic mixed-use. Starts for this year will be approximately $500 million.\nTurning to the balance sheet, we were active in the first quarter where we completed 12 secured loan transactions totaling approximately $2.6 billion. The weighted average interest rate on these loans was 5.73%. At the end of the quarter we had net debt to EBITDA of 5.2x and our fixed charge coverage ratio was incredibly strong at 4.6x. As David mentioned earlier, we are well positioned to allocate capital and be opportunistic through various economic cycles.\nTurning to the dividends, today we announced our dividend of $2.10 per share for the second quarter, a year over year increase of $0.10 or 5%. The dividend is payable on 30 June 2025. Turning to guidance for 2025, we are reaffirming our full year 2025 real estate FFO guidance range of $12.40 to 12.65 per share. As we stated in February when issuing our initial full year 2025 guidance, our range reflects real estate FFO and does not include OPI.\nWe expect the results to trend towards the middle of the range given the current macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty potentially impacting retailer sales.With that, thank you to everyone. David and I are available for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen.

You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys, and the first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nStephene Sakwa\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Rquity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks. Good evening, David and Brian. I guess I know the tariff situation has certainly been de-escalated, but I'm just curious what sort of conversations you were maybe having with retailers kind of leading up to today's announcement. And you know, how do you think it impacts, if at all, the leasing? And I guess, Brian, you sort of talked about sales, but I guess what are you baking in for sales today maybe versus three months ago.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Hi, Steve, let me take that. Brian can add color. It had just on the new lease when we ask, obviously every week to the leasing team, but it's only affected four deals that I am aware of from one European retailer because they were worried about the import cost bringing over goods from Europe. It wasn't big deals, but that's the only one. Other than that, at this point, it hasn't really affected any demand.\nWe're hopeful that it won't because as retailers are looking long term on these stores and at some point we're all hopeful that this stabilizes. Projecting and predicting sales is really difficult because to the extent that there is a retailer that imports goods from China, even with today's kind of reduction in the kind of tit for tat you're still talking about 30% tariff, which is material.\nAt this point many retailers are either holding off bringing in goods from China which could affect their inventory levels, trying to source it elsewhere, which they may or may not be successful with. It said it's a relatively big unknown to the extent that there's a reliance on China, even on today's recent news. Given margins, those tariffs in the 30-ish%, I think are going to give retailers pause whether or not they can afford to have goods shipped to them from China. To the extent that it is in the more flat 10% I think it's really retailer dependent.\nI think they're going to probably operate business as usual. I think they'll try to pass a little bit on to the consumer. They'll try to get the manufacturer to take some of it and they may eat some of it as well. But it shouldn't affect how they operate and how the inventory their stores. China still is a big unknown and so that's why, as Brian said in his comments, look, our sales were relatively flat, if we were relatively flat.\nAs you know, we have a history of certainly beating the midpoint and always trying to achieve the upper end and even higher. It's impossible for us to say what sales are right now just because we don't know inventories. I mean, I think we're going to obviously land within our original guidance, which is good given all the uncertainty. But we're thinking that inventory levels could be affected because of the China tariffs, even with these reduced ones, as I went through, and so I think it has the potential to affect sales, and that's why we're being a little more conservative, and we're thinking it's probably going to be more in the midpoint.\nOne quarter ish, into a very a very uncertain, volatile thing. I'd also say to you, the good news is, other than this one anecdote on it some small deals from one European retailer, you know, demand is still strong, and we haven't seen across the board by any stretch of the imagination, a reduction in leasing demand.\nSo that, in a nutshell, is the latest and greatest. I'm sure if you ask us in a couple of weeks, you know, we might have something new. But you know, you've got retailers that are scrambling now. Remember the way this thing works is that for retailers, you know, the US retailers pay the tariff so they can't get the goods on the boat unless they pay the tariff at the time it's delivered to the boat. So, you know, that's why you're probably seeing a lot of boats not make the journey over or a lot of inventory at the shores in China.\nIt's an unusual situation that we're just going to have to see how it, how it shakes out. Now we're obviously pleased to see that at least the relationship.Relationships seem to be thawing and seem to be on a more constructive path. You know how it all shakes out. I mean, our guess is as good as yours, or your economist, or anybody else.\n\nStephene Sakwa\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Rquity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. That's it for me.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good afternoon. Just as a follow-up there, David, that was really helpful, providing your thoughts. I'm just interested in where you think kind of retailers stand from an inventory perspective in terms of when they do start to run out to the extent shipments from China don't kind of reaccelerate here following the thawing. Have you seen that pull forward of demand in your traffic data here in April and May as consumers kind of pull forward to get ahead of the tariffs.\nJust curious how you think that plays out for just the cadence of retail sales this year, and the last piece, just how you think the de minimis rule impacts some of your retailers. Do you feel like they get a market share boost from the loss of that kind of avenue for retail for customers to some extent.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. All right, let me take it in, only because I can remember it this way. I hope Tom took notes. De Minimis is great for American based companies. De Minimis. Really hurt a number of retailers that obviously paid, you know, paid tariffs and weren't able to avoid that loophole. Obviously a couple of Chinese companies took real advantage of it. That is a great outcome. I want to applaud the administration for dealing with this loophole.\nHopefully it continues. I think that's going to, you know, be a material benefit to our retailers to defend themselves against Chinese retailers that ship directly to the consumer. Okay. That was really, really, really important. Now, you know, with respect to Forever 21, I wish they had done it a couple years ago because it would have leveled the playing field. It is what it is.\nYour second question, or maybe it was your first. I would say that we don't see in our, what our retailers sell, all that pull forward that's been talked about. I think what you have to look at in the first through basically April now we'll get April sales shortly because we're in arrears on that from our retailers. I'll give you a general thing. First of all, two or three things happened, and I'll touch on trastic. One is we had an Easter that was in April versus March. That was obviously very important. That's why March sales were a little bit higher last year than this year. You had weather issues certainly in the outdoor outlet centers.\nFor us in February, the weather was historically bad compared to 2024 and traffic year through the quarter was, I would say, down slightly. When you look at year to date through April, it's actually up year to date because now we've taken into account April. Traffic is holding up. The malls are actually performing above, and the outlets are relatively flat. I would say what we're seeing in the outlet on a traffic point of view is we have assets on the border, whether in Mexico or Canada, there's been a slowdown in traffic and sales on some of our border great long-term assets. Currently, you know, with all the rhetoric, we're seeing some.\nTraffic diminution on some of the border assets, you know, with Canada and our Mexican customers. Hopefully as that rhetoric dies down, we'll get back to normal on what. I think your first question, retailers basically have the way I understand it, which is not perfect and every retailer is different. I would say they have probably another.\nMonth or so, maybe longer to decide what they're going to do with respect to China for Q4 inventory. I've seen a number of retailers have already reduced their exposure to China dramatically. As I said earlier, those retailers are more or less taking the 10%. Told you kind of how they're thinking about it, but you know, it's business as usual. To the extent it's China, they're either trying to replicate the goods elsewhere. If they can't, they're, I think, holding off on making a China decision.\nI think they probably, this is squishy, but they probably have a month, ish. When, if they still are in a holding pattern whether to pull the trigger or not, it could affect inventory levels in Q4, but I think that's so retail idiosyncratic it's hard for me to make that blanket statement. I think the European retailers.\nHave much better control over their production, and I don't see any change coming from them. I think their approach will be more on how they're going to price their goods to the ultimate end consumer. Hope that's helpful, I think did I cover all three?\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nYeah, you got it. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nSamir Khanal [Director\n\nUS REITs Analyst] (Bank of America)\n\nGood afternoon everybody. David, I guess given the uncertainty out there and kind of what you said, retailers scrambling to make sort of long term decisions, has that, has your approach changed and kind of how you're dealing with your tenants, whether, you know, when you're negotiating leases, whether it's, you know, on new deals, whether it's pricing or TI's, I mean, how are you approaching the situation sort of here given the uncertainty out there for tenants to make long term decisions. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nLike I said, the only anecdotal thing is one retailer backing out of four outlet deals is not a big deal to us because they were replacement tenants that we already have leased. Honestly, as I said earlier it's business as usual. Supply is still very much constrained, demand is still strong.\nThe reliance, as I said earlier, from China is much reduced. Right now I can't guarantee it, but right now it's business as usual. I don't think we're doing really anything out of the ordinary in dealing with them. Obviously, the extent they have a specific issue, we'll try to address it. They have come a long way on their supply chain.\nBeen reducing the Chinese imports for a long time. I do worry a little bit about not the bigger ones. Again, we haven't seen I think the bigger retailers have, you know, sophisticated supply chains and long-term relationships with suppliers everywhere. I do think the main street retailers, local moms and pops.\nWe all need as a country to be focused on. I think they could have more. Again, we haven't seen it, but if I had to venture. If things don't stabilize, which today is a good step, but if they don't ultimately stabilize, I think you'll have potential pressure points on the local mom and pop retailers that are important to the country. And obviously we, you know, we do lease space to them. Again, I'm not hopefully I'm not anticipating we're not seeing a problem. I do worry about that a little bit more than say, XYZ that has 100 stores.\n\nSamir Khanal [Director\n\nUS REITs Analyst] (Bank of America)\n\nThank you, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you talk about the back leasing of those Forever 21 boxes, what types of tenants are you seeing interest in taking the space? Those tend to be bigger boxes. Have you needed to break them up, and how quickly can you get Red Ping tenanted?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, look, I think the demand has been really good. We've got basically over half of them leased. With that, those economics, we've already replaced the rent that Forever 21 was paying us I think it's a combination of, we're doing a lot of business with Primark. Zara's of the world, they're in some cases splitting it up.\nWe're very focused on it. We will more than double at the end of the day, and it'll take a couple years, all in to at least basically 100 stores. We'll more than double the rent at the end of the two-year process. Brian, you agree with that?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, no, absolutely. We got about 50 of them addressed. We think those 50, about half of those start commencement of rent this year, the other half next year, with the balance kind of finishing out as we complete our leasing efforts. Michael.To David's point, we do think rents are going to at least double.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much. Good luck in the second quarter.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, good afternoon out there, David. Appreciate your comment about the mom and pop retailers. Pretty interesting, especially given your platform. A question, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like the consumer is fine, despite what we read online, in the newspapers, etc. Recession, job loss, whatever, but it sounds like the consumer is fine, the shopper is fine.\nIt sounds like the real wild card is inventory levels. It sounds like restaurants and the other similar services that are not impacted by tariffs are doing well. Is that correct that we should—the real concern to earnings is really about inventory levels and whether they can sell out products and hit percent rents, or are there other things that are playing into your outlook?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, I'd say it's all around sales now. Sales is more than just inventory levels. It's consumer sentiment. That's hard to predict, Alex, as you know. I mean, right now it's pretty good. Our sales are flat. X2 retailers are basically flat. Again, we don't have April sales, but that was basically flat through end of March. Again, I explained the Easter being in Q1 versus Q2 this year.\nI expect sales, once I get April numbers, to be up first four months over the year compared to last year. The consumer, I think, is fine. I do think they're being a little more cautious. I do think Tourism is. I don't, this may be the wrong word, flattening, waning. What are the different phases of the moon? Waxing, waning, whatever it is.\nI think tourism to the US is going to be cautious this year, whether it's from Mexican nationals, Canadians, or Europeans. I do think, and again, we have, we've just seen a little bit on the border. On the other hand, the dollar is weaker, so maybe that offsets it. I do think there should be a little bit caution to the wind on just some the sales that are generated by non-US consumers, you put it all together.\nThe economy is clearly a little bit uncertain. You put it all together, and it makes it really hard to predict sales right now. Even if it's, you know, like I said, we're just thinking it's going to be a little more cautious, and that's why we're, you know, indicating it's probably more likely. We have this history of beating and raising, and we're trying to be realistic given the set of circumstances that we're dealing with. That's why we're thinking sales, and it's really only sales. That have the variability that could ultimately produce us more in the middle of the range.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nDavid, if I could just ask clarification, your comments on the US consumer, is that the same for your European and Asian portfolios, or are those consumers experiencing different trends?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nIn the US, there's actually and it's basically our portfolio on investment in Klépierre. Japan is. It's all internationally. It's all very good. They're not, their playing field there hasn't changed. We don't expect that whole business, whether it's Europe and Asia for us is basically stability. We're outperforming in Europe and in Asia. You know, obviously, you know, there's fluctuations. Korea could be up, Japan could be down. But generally. It's basically according to plan. I don't expect any change there. The US consumer that goes to these places really doesn't drive our business.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nIt's more the Germans going to Italy, and that kind of stuff.Certainly more likely the Chinese go to Europe than they come here.\nOkay.\nOperator, I think we're ready for next.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVP and Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, everyone. Maybe one thing that's tougher to predict than the tenant sales results is OPI. With that in mind, I guess wondering, David, if you could go through some of the OPI performance in Q1, kind of talk about what's going on there. I know they aren't part of guidance, but just trying to understand how some of the revenue and cost synergies that were planned for 2025 are going, expectations for those to progress throughout the year. I guess separately would be how the tariff situation could impact JCPenney and the other Catalyst brands this year.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAgain, OPI had improvement. Again, OPI is basically three businesses. Just so everybody knows, it's our e-commerce business, RGG, Shop Simon, which we own roughly 45%. Our interest in Catalyst Group, which is Penny and the other operating brands, Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, et cetera, which we now own, remind me, 39%, and or 50% interest in Jamestown. That's all it is. That's all it plans to be. It is not what we live and breathe every day, though. We're focused on creating value there as we have with ABG and our other OPI investments.\nGetting to your question, we had quarter over quarter improvement in cattle. The other two businesses are stable, fine, going according to plan. The Catalyst brands had real improvement quarter over quarter. As you know, part of that was being not only the synergies that it was achieving in the merger, but also the F21 bankruptcy. F21 is gone. They're getting their synergies. Penny, in terms of sourcing goods. They have a lot less reliance on China.\nThere is some reliance on China. They're trying to source it elsewhere. If not, I think they're going to be one of these retailers that have to decide in the next six weeks whether to pull the trigger to bring goods here or not. Obviously, they're negotiating very very hard with their suppliers. They have I mean, the administration is right. They have more leverage in negotiating with suppliers because the US is a big market. They're in a tricky spot. It's very hard to predict sales for those brands just like it would be for some other retailers. Some of the brands and catalysts, like Brooks Brothers, is doing great.\nThey're achieving the synergies that they wanted. The business is on plan. The bottom line is, even with today's uncertainty, we still expect to have, again, it doesn't show in our numbers because of depreciation that I've explained to everybody, but we expect Catalyst to have positive EBITDA this year even with all the tariff economic uncertainty that it's going forward again, I would suggest you don't worry about it all that much. That's what we're telling the market. We're happy to answer any and every question except what the price of a cotton shirt is at Brooks Brothers. That I don't know. Actually, I do, but I don't want to be a know it all.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVP and Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks David.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nActually is wearing. Tom, you look very nice. Okay. That's a good looking shirt. Actually, it's better than those you used to wear, those weird shirts. Okay, I think he's a Brooks Brothers consumer.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVP and Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nDirector, Scotiabank\n\nHi. Hey, David. Hey, Brian. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape, but has macroeconomic uncertainty reached a point where you're making adjustments to capital plans to maybe become a bit more defensive? Whether that's reconsidering certain development activity CapEx or your appetite for acquisitions or otherwise?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThat's a great question. I would say we're still making long term decisions we're very fortunate to since we've been public, as far as I can remember, even with COVID thrown at us, the great financial recession, and everything else, we've never, since I've been involved, we've never been over our skis.\nWe haven't even put on our skis, if I can keep with the analogy. Right. Is that the right word? We're not, we haven't even put on our skis recently. We've been cautious to begin with. Now we have all these opportunities, we're very studious in them. I would say, yes, instinctively we're more cautious right now. You know, we are expecting, you know, our development pipeline is there, but it's not, you know, we're not going crazy with it. I think it'll continue. We are expecting construction costs to increase the things that haven't started.\nObviously, we don't start construction until we have to know guaranteed max price anyway. The things that are on the docket to start. We're getting through, we're not pulling triggers until we have all the, all the costs finalized and everything else. I think caution is the word of order. That doesn't mean we won't buy something or that we won't continue to do our pipeline. It'd be foolish for us not to be a little more cautious.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nGreg, I think the only thing I would add there is, as you know, as volatility increases, sometimes for us, opportunities increase. We have a strong pipeline, and we are clinical with our capital, as you know, so nothing really materially changed, obviously a bit more cautionary relative to the headlines these days.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI'll give you a simple example. I was just thinking out loud, but we had one development in Asia. I was going to say it, but it just didn't feel like the right time to do it. Just because it wasn't material, and it just feels like we should be a little more cautious. Again, I don't want to, I don't want to say that we aren't going to do a couple of deals here that could even be nontrivial. Caution is the word of order right now.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nDirector, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. If I'm looking at development pipeline maybe we don't go much above this kind of $1 billion level for now, an acquisition is still on the table, but of course everything depends on the underwriting.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, Greg, I would say, as you heard me in my prepared remarks, you know, we ultimately believe that we're going to start about $500 million of projects that are not included in that $1 billion spend level. We are still advancing, you know, our projects that are ready to move forward. We're just doing so thoughtfully.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay. Thank you, Brian. Thanks, David.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed.\n\nFloris Van Dijkum\n\nCompass Point, Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst\n\nThank you. David, you sound very chipper. I'm glad to hear your voice. Can I ask you about the SNO pipeline? Where it stands today? I think end of fourth quarter was at 250 basis points. Has that grown, and how do you see that? Can you quantify that for us? What's the timing of those rents coming online.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYou may ask, but I'm gonna have Brian answer.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nIt's about 300 basis points today from SNO Pipeline. We're standing about 300 basis points. When you run the math, that's about $150 million worth of rent at our average rents. Again, that's not all incremental to the existing kind of space, so it's not all going to be additive here. We probably believe that the back half of this year you're probably going to see 30%-40% of that.\n\nFloris Van Dijkum\n\nCompass Point, Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst\n\nThe bulk of that will hit in 2026. Is there also some spillover into 2027?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\n26 in some 27, we are seeing some looking out further or have been looking out further. Some of that is included in that as well.\n\nFloris Van Dijkum\n\nCompass Point, Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst\n\nThat includes the Forever 21 spaces as well.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nIt does, yes.\n\nFloris Van Dijkum\n\nCompass Point, Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThe ones that are least signed up, yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nGreen Street, Managing Director, Head of US Industrial and Mall Research\n\nHi, good evening. Could you discuss trends in tenant sales in a little bit more detail? I'm curious if there are any specific tenants or categories that are having an outsized impact on the decline in trailing twelve month portfolio sales results?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I mentioned one of the decreases, I mean it's a marginal decrease, but yet two. We don't like to get into specific retailers, but we had two that were basically flat. If you put those two retailers aside, Easter was not in this versus last 12 months of last time. Vince, when you cut through.\nIs relatively flat. We had a little, you know, the malls were a little bit above, outlets were a little bit down. I mentioned earlier, part of that was because of the weather. You know, we had a very tough you probably never experienced it being in Southern California, Newport Beach, where it's sunny. Most of the time, you have other issues there. Right. Earthquakes and unfortunately fires. We had a little softness in some of our border activity. I would say by and large our top 25 retailers had were pretty much doing okay. No, other than that color and nothing unusual on sales?\n\nVince Tibone\n\nGreen Street, Managing Director, Head of US Industrial and Mall Research\n\nThat's great to hear. Appreciate the color. One more, switching gears, you didn't mention department stores as it relates to any tariff-related or inventory concerns. I would imagine many of their products are sourced from China. I'm just curious, what is your current. Outlook for department store closures over the next few years? Has it changed at all with any of this macro uncertainty?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, it depends on the department store. For instance. If they don't have private label, they're not sourcing their own goods. They really don't have the tariff, you know, the China tariff exposure that you might think. It really depends on which department store you're talking about and how big their private label business is.\nIf they sell mostly branded goods, then it's really their relationship with the wholesaler and what the wholesaler, so the wholesaler has to pay the import if they get it from China or elsewhere, how they want to negotiate that between a wholesaler's manufacturer and what they want to pass that on to the department store. That's a whole complicated and what the consumer pays. There's just no way to really know how that all shakes out.\nAs far as we can see on department store closures, you know, we don't see, you know, we, as you know, we had the Macy's announcement, we had one that was affected by that. It wouldn't surprise me, if again, you don't see pruning just like you do from every retailer on their store level. I don't expect any real major changes right now. Again, the tariff situation is idiosyncratic to that department store and mostly impacts whether or not they have a big private label business.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nGreen Street, Managing Director, Head of US Industrial and Mall Research\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nYeah, hi. Going back to sales for a second, I know you flagged Easter and two retailers, but would your recent sales trends be materially different, either positively or negatively, if you look at things on an NOI weighted basis?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, I would say we used to always do that. I didn't see it. We had it. We don't do it by waiting anymore. Well, we should do that, by the way. That's another. That's me telling my guys. I would say when I look at it, you know, they do. There's no question that the better properties are getting better. The simple answer to that is sales would be up. We can give you the specific numbers, but sales would be up. If you NOI weighed it unequivocally, 500. Assets are up about 1.5%. That doesn't include. That again has Easter in March of last year, not April of this year.\n\nMichael Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nGot it. Okay. Great. Maybe one other one on the $500 million in development starts. I think, Brian, you mentioned mixed-use components in there. How much of those dollars, or even the overall redevelopment pipeline of those dollars, are, you know, directly retail versus some other property type, whether it's office, hotel or resi.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI mean, effectively the 60% that isn't mixed use, quite honestly, Michael.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay, so 60% retail and the other 40% would be mixed-use. All the other component.\n\nMichael Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nOkay, perfect. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nBy the way, that's at our share. Again, we're going to do a big residential development in Brea Mall, but we have a partner for that. That's 500 new starts is our share. It's a bigger pipe than just that. It's just we boil it down to our shares.\n\nMichael Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REITs and CRE Research, Morgan Stanely\n\nGreat. Hey, just wanted to go back to the guidance and I think some of the assumptions and inputs that have come into last time. Appreciate it. Still early, but how are you guys thinking about sort of domestic property NOI bad debt, as well as the $0.25 and $0.30 interest cost headwind for this year. Just how does those sort of change since the last three months? Thanks so much.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNo change. Really?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYes. No change to any of those amounts. You can see the interest income starting to come down. It's about $0.06 in the quarter. We would expect that to carry forward for the balance of the year. You will also see some more interest expense come through as we refinance our debt later this year, slightly higher coupon, but no material change to the other elements of the guidance we announced at the beginning of the year.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REITs and CRE Research, Morgan Stanely\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\n\nRavi Vaidya [Equity Research\n\nREITs] (Mizuho Securities)\n\nHi there. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Hope you guys are doing well. I wanted to particularly ask about your luxury tenants. Are you seeing, what are you hearing from them in terms of sales and foot traffic, and maybe has there been any sort of pause or pullback on leasing demand from luxury tenants in particular?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNot really.\nAgain, and I think it's very brand specific. You have some that are absolutely on fire, others that are bringing in new designers and updating the brand. But all of that's been pretty consistent for our outlook and what's been going on. They think very long term like we do. There really hasn't been a change of mood or commitment from those brands. Overall, I'd say the business is. There's always ups and downs, but I'd say overall from a sales point of view, relatively flat. So we haven't seen the big sales growth, but I think a lot of that is more you have a few brands that are just in the midst of, you know, bringing in new designers and more of updating their brand.\n\nSamir Khanal [Director\n\nUS REITs Analyst] (Bank of America)\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSenior VP and Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYes. Hi. In terms of not seeing pull forward in demand now, do you think there's a scenario where pull forward demand materializes in Q3? If consumers shop earlier for the holiday season, if there's concern that inventories are low or product is more expensive.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, we have seen that a little bit historically. I would say it's possible. If that's the case margins might be okay because, you know, price for retailers, prices could go up. I do think it's possible. We have seen that in other cases. I wouldn't rule it out. I think, it's to be determined, but I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSenior VP and Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nOmotayo Okusanyo\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REIT Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nYes, good afternoon. Just a quick question on the $2.8 billion of debt refinancing. When you just talk a little bit about what that market looks like today. Any big changes in terms LTV how lenders are generally looking at the asset class at this point?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I'd say that lenders are very comfortable with the asset class. I mean, we've been upgraded from stable to positive from S&P, from A from an S&P perspective from an unsecured perspective $1.6 billion of maturities here. We will refinance that back in the unsecured markets throughout the balance of the year. On the mortgage side, you continue to see lenders, CMBS, life insurance companies, and others looking at the asset class and looking to deploy capital. Given our leverage levels we are relatively conservative from a financial point of view, as you know. That opens us up to an opportunity to refinance.\nWhat we did earlier in the year is representative of that gold loan done in Q1. I think, you know, the market is open for us to continue to refinance. Importantly, we're rolling over our debt. We're not looking for incremental capital. We're not looking to extract excess proceeds to redeploy into our business. We're doing that with our free cash flow.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThe good news is good retail real estate has people are very comfortable financially and certainly our company.\n\nOmotayo Okusanyo\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REIT Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to David Simon for closing remarks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay, just thank you, everybody. I think we'll talk soon. I believe, at least I do think the mood's getting more certain and more stable. We're optimistic about this uncertainty resolving itself shortly.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

For those who would like to participate in the question and answer session, we ask you to please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I am pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nGood evening everyone. We delivered robust financial and operational results yet again for the second quarter. Occupancy gains, increased shopper traffic, and higher retail sales volumes contributed to strong cash flow growth. We continue to enhance our retail real estate platforms through development, redevelopment, and acquisitions, including the purchase of our partner's interest in Brickell City Centre, a premier mixed-use property in Miami and its rapidly growing central business district.\nOur focus remains on creating long-term value through disciplined investments and operational excellence that drive growth and cash flow, funds from operations, and dividends per share, which yet again we raised. I'm now going to turn it over to Brian who will cover our second quarter results in more detail.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nGood evening, and thank you, David. Real estate FFO was $3.05 per share in the second quarter, compared to $2.93 in the prior year. 4.1% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed 21 cents of growth, driven by a 5% increase in lease income. As anticipated, lower interest income and higher interest expense combined were a 7-cent drag year over year. Domestic property NOI increased 4.2% year over year for the quarter and 3.8% for the first half of the year.\nPortfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.7% for the quarter and 4.2% for the first half. We signed approximately 1,000 leases for more than 3.6 million sq ft in the quarter, with approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the quarter on new deals.\nNearly 90% of our leases expiring through 2025 are complete and ahead of this time. Last year, the malls and Premium Outlets ended the second quarter at 96.0% occupancy, up 10 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year over year. The Mills achieved a record 99.3% occupancy, an increase of 90 basis points sequentially and 110 basis points from the prior year. Occupancy remained strong across the portfolio, overcoming retailer bankruptcies of approximately 1.8 million.\nSquare feet this quarter.\nAverage base minimum rent for the malls and outlets increased 1.3% year over year, and The Mills increased 0.6%. Sales for malls and Premium Outlets per sq ft were $736 for the quarter, and occupancy costs at the end of the quarter were 13.1%, flat sequentially from Q1 2025.\nSecond quarter funds from operations were $1.19 billion or $3.15 per share compared to $1.09 billion or $2.90 per share last year. 8.6% growth. Second quarter results include a $0.21 per share non-cash after-tax gain primarily due to Catalyst Brands deconsolidation of Forever 21. In addition, better operational performance at Catalyst Brands compared to last year and lastly a $0.13 per share non-cash loss from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustment on our exchangeable bonds due to the outperformance of Klépierre's share price which increased 8% during the second quarter.\nNow turning to development, at the end of the quarter, development projects were underway across all platforms with our share of net cost of $1 billion and a.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nBlended yield of 9%.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nApproximately 40% of net costs are for mixed-use projects. As David mentioned, we acquired our partner's interest in Brickell City Centre. Our $512 million investment includes the retail and parking components and is accretive. We now fully own and manage this highly productive center and look forward to enhancing operations with efficiencies in our leasing and management expertise to drive NOI growth. Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, during the first half of the year, we completed 21 secured loan transactions totaling approximately $3.8 billion. The weighted average interest rate on these loans was 5.84%, and we ended the quarter with over $9 billion of liquidity.\nTurning to the dividend, today we announced our dividend of $2.15 per share for Q3, a year-over-year increase of $0.10 or 4.9%. The dividend is payable 30 September.\nNow moving on to guidance, we are increasing our full year 2025 Real Estate FFO guidance range to $12.45 to $12.65 per share compared to $12.24 last year. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.03 at the midpoint. With that, thank you and David and I are now available for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. And for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nJeff Spector\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you. Given them first. I'll keep it high level. Just given all the uncertainty as of today, I guess, could you describe for us the leasing velocity you're seeing some of the demand? Maybe a peek into, you know, your last leasing meeting in terms of quantity, deal flow, and quality of the deals. Please. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nUnabated. So you're right, Jeff, in the sense that you know the whole world.\nAnd is uncertain. A lot of geopolitical stuff going on. Obviously.\nA lot of domestic political stuff going on. New York City. Thankfully we're not an investor in New York City, but obviously a lot of political uncertainty in New York City.\nYou know, tariff.\nYou know, swings back and forth.\nInterest rate uncertainty.\nYou know, you can, you can name it.\nHowever, you have unbelievable stewards.\nThat are us, you know, in particular, that are able to manage that.\nIn addition.\nYou know, retail demand is really unabated and you know, the physical shopping environment.\nYou know, continues to be the place to be. So we're quite bullish about what we've done, what we are doing.\nWhere we are going.\nDespite, you know, all of the, you know, headlines that are out there so unabated. You know, if you look at our 33-year, almost track record, you know, I kind of laugh.\nYou know, I guess not to segue, but to segue.\nI kind of chuckled to myself in that, you know, some of our, you know, you read all these companies that are restructuring.\nWell, now they're going to lease their properties better. Now they're going to manage their balance sheet better.\nNow they're going to bring in new management and be better.\nYou know, if you look at our particular little niche, you know, we've had bankruptcies, we've had people that have bought companies that have overpaid, that had to restructure their operations, wholesale management changes, you know, restructuring of operations, this, that, the other. There's one group, one group that's never done that and that's us. All we've done is run our business appropriately and we'll continue to do so.\nAnd, you know, it's something that I think investors and analysts in particular, Jeff, should point that out. You've never read about a Simon Property Group, you know, restructuring. Yes, we had to do some, you know, certain drastic things.\nYou know, to deal with COVID and to deal with the Great Financial Crisis. But, you know, there's been no restructuring of this company, only things that have benefited shareholders. So, you know, the headline risks are out there, they're real.\nTenant demand is unabated, traffic's up, sales are holding their own, and our properties are continuing to get better.\n\nJeff Spector\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Griffin with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Griffin\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe just diving into that tenant demand piece a bit more. You know, probably seems like the national retailers and concepts have, you know, a greater footing or clarity around their, you know, real estate footprint needs. But for maybe some of those smaller tenants, maybe those mom and pop local concepts, are you still seeing strong demand from those as well? David, you touched about kind of across the board demand, but just curious if you can kind of bifurcate those two pieces. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, you're right. Last quarter I did express my concern about that segment given how tariffs might affect them and their cost of goods.\nBut it's. They're beating their plan so far this year. So it's all systems go there. I'm sure there's trepidation, but I think they're managing it.\nYou know, as best they can. I still think the full story.\nObviously, given the volatility, has not been written, but.\nWe're not seeing it in demand. That particular business that is sensitive to Moms and Pops continues to perform well. So, you know, we're more optimistic about that segment than I was last quarter. But, you know, like I said, you know, it is. It is something that we're watching closely.\n\nMichael Griffin\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thanks. Maybe just on the acquisition side, you guys were active in the first half with acquisitions, which was exciting to see. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the upside you see at Brickell and then more broadly to what extent other acquisition opportunities seem to exist for Simon today, either from JV Partners or otherwise.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Well, Brickell is a really good asset that, long term, will be great. Miami, you know, Caitlin, I'm sure you're familiar with it. We're in the central business district. There's no real retail that can be built in that because of the traffic of Miami. It's kind of its own sub market.\nEven though, you know, there's a lot of retail generally in Miami, just because of the traffic and the population density, and the tourism.\nIt is really, you know, you can have a number of properties that flourish. Central business district, you see what Citadel is doing there.\nI still think you'll see.\nA continuation of.\nNew York and Chicago companies moving there. So the job prospects are great. And Brickell in itself deals and attracts a lot of international.\nCustomers. Tourism, it's got the hotels, it's got the nightlife.\nWe just think the assets going to get better and better, and there'll be more development around it that.\nwill continue to fuel its growth. We bought it on a very accretive basis. We bought it at a higher cap rate than the strip centers that are being sold today. Strip centers that are subject to, you know, probably easier competition.\nEasier to build.\nYou know.\nBrickell, we bought it at below its replacement cost by far.\nIt hasn't even had its first rollovers of rents.\nNow, this is our core business, so I think we'll do better leasing and managing the assets. We're very excited about Brickell.\nAs we, you know, as we are with the mall. We're working on a few other things that, you know, we're able to do, and I mentioned this before.\nWe're working on some other interesting things that.\nWe're able to do because we've never gone through a restructuring. Oh, great. It's great to buy them all because you haven't bought anything in a decade. Well, that's never been us.\nAnd so we'll keep.\nFinding.\nOpportunities where we can grow our platform, but we're going to be, you know, we're going to be picky on what we, what we buy and what we want to do, but we're able to do it because, you know, this company doesn't need to sell a bunch of assets, doesn't need to bring in a new management team, you know, it doesn't need to downsize its platform, you know.\nDoesn't need to do it because it's outperformed over a 30-plus-year period, you know, that no one else has done. So.\nWe're hopeful that a couple more things will get announced this year. They'll be accretive, they'll add to our platform, and that we'll be able to manage them better. So we'll be able to grow our cash flow.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for all that.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, good afternoon out there, David. Just, you know, continuing on.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWe're actually in New York City. That's why I brought up the New York City Council.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, well, then you're just down the train line from us here in Greenwich, so hopefully you're enjoying the city.\nA question, just following up on Caitlin's question on externals. For quite a long time, you've been reiterating to us that you see more investment potential in your existing portfolio versus externally. So if Tom will forgive me for a two-parter, one, what is the return threshold, the gap that you need when you go externally versus ability to reinvest internally in your existing? And two, it does seem like we're on the cusp of a mall transaction wave where capital is starting to flow back to malls across the spectrum.\nAnd just sort of curious if in your view this is going to set up like a repeat that we had in the, I guess, late 90s, early 2000s, when there was suddenly within a few years this massive mall trade. So wondering if you're foreseeing that. So that's my two-parter. Forgive me, Tom.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, you don't have to Tom. You don't have to ask for forgiveness from Tom. He's a very nice man. We'll give you a free pass Alex. So look, I don't, I think a lot goes into acquisitions.\nAnd, you know, it's not an either-or thing. I think, you know, we have, as you know, Alex, the balance sheet and the firepower to do both. And the development process that is, or the redevelopment process takes, you know, years to do. Right. So, you know, take Brea, that, you know, is under construction and we had to buy the Sears store, we had to get approvals, and we had to build, you know, we're about to start on the multifamily.\nThat's over a three-year process. So it's not like suddenly the money just goes out day one. So we've never had this.\nYou know, dilemma that you're suggesting where it's an either-or. And I think.\nFrom a math point of view, we look at it kind of the, you know, similar basis. Do we, are we buying it.\nOr when we're redeveloping or developing, are we creating net asset value?\nSo if it's a mall, you know, is the redevelopment yield higher than, you know, where that asset might trade, and what does it do to the overall assets growth rate of cash flow?\nlot goes into that. But that's the basics. Then on an acquisition, it's a little bit of the same thing with our expertise, you know, what does it do for the platform? Does it deepen our relationships with the retailers?\nYou know, are we buying it under replacement costs? And you know, as we, and when we look back, will it be pristine as an asset, and you know, so you have to take a little bit longer term view on that.\nBut it's not.\nIt has not, you know, it has not created this.\nSituation where we can't do both. And so our goal is to continue to do both and to push to do both.\nThe reason we haven't done as many acquisitions is we really have been product and price sensitive and will continue to be product and price sensitive because we can't create NAV.\nWithout focusing on the product and the price sensitivity. So as my, you know, I'm on the board of Apollo and not to quote Mark Rowan, but I'll go ahead and quote him. You know, purchase price matters. Okay? So, you know, it does. So, you know, and.\nWe're very focused on that. So rest assured, when we buy something, we vetted the price.\nReally vetted the price. So going to your next thing, I'm not sure about whether there's going to be this huge, you know.\nMall transactions. I think you'll have other players come in.\nYou know, buying.\nMaybe not necessarily, you know, quote A properties, but a lot of Bs. Because, you know, the reality is you can make, you know, you can, you're stable and you can create, you know, a nice arbitrage and manage them and lease them and improve them. And they're a lot stickier than people believe because, you know, most malls, Alex, I hate to break it to you, but most enclosed malls are 30 to 50 years old. And yet, you know, despite the media, the naysayers, you know, they've, and that's not to say there hasn't been a significant amount of obsolescence, but most of them, you know, are here today still fighting pretty good battle.\nAnd despite.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nYou.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, a lot of things not going their way. So I think there'll be more trades, but I don't, I'm not sure. It'll just be this huge, huge wave of transactions. Ryan, you can weigh in if you want, but that's kind of, you know, just some random rambling thoughts. Alex, you can comment. I will let Tom give you another pass. You can comment on my comments while Brian is contemplating whether he will want to add anything to it. So your turn first, Alex.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nNo, I'm going to defer to others who want to ask. That was a very thorough. So thank you, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nBrian, nothing to add.\nYou covered it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, guys, good evening. I wanted to maybe circle back on some of the themes of the earlier questions. David, just, you know, a lot's happened in the last 90 days, and last quarter your message was, you know, a little bit more realistic, I think, in the face of uncertainty. And, you know, Brian kind of focused us to the midpoint of guidance. Fast forward 90 days. Maybe there's been a little bit less fallout than then would have expected. You guys raised the low end.\nWould you still kind of point us to that, that midpoint of guidance, maybe update us on, you know, your views today of, you know, how you're feeling about the macro, and are you concerned about, you know, any lingering effect of policy or geopolitical happenings kind of weighing on 2026 growth?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, let me. I'll let Brian kind of. I'll be less verbose than I was with Alex. I will say, unquestionably.\nEven though we raised the bottom, I mean, we're still very cautious about, you know.\nThe economic environment. We have to be right. I mean, you know, tariffs are a real cost to doing business and.\nThey're changing, you know, consistently. Right.\nThe only consistent thing about tariffs is that they've been consistently changing. Right. So, and it's a cost to do business now, you know, ultimately who pays that cost? You know, is it the consumer? No, there's only, first of all it's the domestic company that imports, right. So they start with the cost.\nPain, and you can see it in Ford and a number of other companies, and said it's going to cost me $800 million or $1 billion. Then the next question is, can the suppliers chip in and ultimately the consumer. I think most companies are kind of working.\nThat next step or two through. So in that scenario, it is, it is hard for us not to be cautious, and obviously from just pure retail, are they going to, they're going to be more cautious on buying.\nThen they might not otherwise be. Who cares at the same time the US economic.\nLandscape looks, you know, I mean I don't have to tell you how much money and capital is planning to be spent in the US. That's a huge driver of GDP.\nI don't think it'll be all that's out there now, all that's announced, but you know there's going to be a huge driver of GDP growth.\nYou know, the ultimate ramifications of those investments are uncertain. But that's several years down the road, I believe.\nSo you know, we're optimistic about the growth profile in the US, but you know, I mean it's.\nThere's a lot of variabilities that all companies are dealing with. So.\nAgain, I said I wasn't going to be long-winded. It turns out that I was. But so I think the bottom line is we're being a little more cautious. I think 26 actually to me might feel better only because by then you'll know the tariffs.\nThe tariffs could be a one-time cost at that time, you know, between the suppliers and.\nThe vendors or the importers, you've kind of, you've kind of figured out who's going to pay for it and.\nIt'll surface and then you'll be able to go forward and operate the business. So I don't think 26 will have this kind of volatility from the tariff.\nScenario and it actually could look better. Brian, Craig, I guess all I would.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nAdd to that is, as you look at kind of what we did for.\nGuidance, certainly looking back over history, it.\nIs not we traditionally will bring up.\nThe bottom end of our range at.\nThis point in the year after.\nYou know, seeing the first six months, occupancy's up, FFO is up. So I think we're cautiously optimistic too.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nDavid's point for the balance of the year.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, David. I think you've mentioned increased shopper traffic on the call twice now. So are you able to quantify what you're seeing, and is there any difference in the traffic growth between mall and outlet or any other way that you can segregate it with the goal of trying to understand if the consumer is, if there's any trends for the consumer at different price points?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, our traffic is up 1.5%. So that's the number.\nI would still.\nYou know, we're not.\nOperating on all cylinders. Where we see.\nA little bit of sales and traffic weakness or.\nBorder, you know, these assets are still great, so don't get me wrong, but generally they provide.\nPretty healthy sales growth. And right now they're relatively flat. But I would say.\nThe softness, at least based upon historical results, has been assets.\nAnd it doesn't really matter whether it's an outlet or a full price mall, but it's assets that are on the border, north or south. Okay. It's almost irrelevant whether it's Canadian border or the Mexican border.\nAnd so from a sales and traffic point of view, we're not hitting it on all cylinders because those that freedom of going back and forth, you know, to shop or whatever is.\nYou know, is.\nYou know, is restricted. And I would also say, you know, we're not seeing the benefit that normally you might see from a weaker US dollar vis-à-vis the euro or certain other currencies.\nYou know, as the international tourist is not growing or flatlining.\nIn terms of people, the way, you know, you might see historically. So those kind of tourist oriented centers are not again, they're great centers.\nSo they have a high bar to achieve, but they're not hopefully being articulate, but they're not outperforming like they always do for us. We're kind of in line. So therefore we're not, in my opinion, not performing at the highest level because those great properties, border, north, south tourism, are kind of operating within the normal portfolio performance. Make sense. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks.\nOur next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nHey, David, thanks for taking the question. David, maybe if you could comment on, I think last quarter I asked about your leasing pipeline of being around 300 basis points. And as I look at your portfolio, your Mills assets are 99.3% leased or something like that.\nIs this getting to be the new?\nNormal on the supply-constrained market? I did notice your TRG assets saw a drop, but the rents were up markedly. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about where the greatest growth potential is in your view.\nBetween the various segments of your portfolio. If you could maybe expound on that and then maybe talk update on the SNO pipeline as well, please.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nSo, Floris, I'll start with the NOI. It's at 340 basis points at the end of the quarter as we think about, and you've heard us talk, you know, about occupancy. It's the optimization of that. Occupancy is where we're kind of at in the point in the cycle now.\nAnd so it's really finding merchandise mix.\nFinding tenants that make the properties better.\nAnd so there'll be more of that replacement of existing tenants with new tenants going forward. It's really going to drive the performance of the portfolio, and it's across all of our asset classes. So The Mills still, even at a high occupancy, the tenant demand is still.\nStrong, and we're able to replace underperforming tenants.\nI think you can say the.\nSame across the outlet and the Mills businesses. I mean, excuse me, the outlet in.\nThe mall businesses as well.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. And Taubman, no, there's TRG. You know, they. It's a smaller portfolio. So swing here and there has a bigger impact. Couple of Forever 21. So as Brian mentioned in the text, we lost 1.8 million sq ft in bankruptcy. 1.7 of that was Forever 21. That has a bigger impact on a smaller portfolio. And that's really what transpired at the TRG level.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nIn terms of occupancy, is 99 your goal now internally? Do you think you can get that for the other platforms as well?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYou know, I mean, I want every space leased, you know, with the highest productive tenant.\nI think, you know, it's an interesting tidbit. 99.3%. I don't get excited about it one way or another.\nNow. Next quarter it could be 99.5% or it could be 99.1%.\nI think it's neither here nor there. Okay. The team's doing a good job. Give them a pat on the back.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street Capital Market. Please proceed.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nHi, good afternoon. I was a bit surprised Simon was not more active acquiring JCPenney boxes from Copper Property Trust, like just big picture. Can you discuss how you're currently thinking about, you know, the importance of owning and controlling additional anchor boxes at your centers and how that, how your appetite to acquire these may vary based on center quality? You know, near term redevelopment prospects. Just love to pick your brain on that topic.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, well, again, this is complicated matters, so I'm not going to talk about it specifically, but it's really, it's really up to Catalyst. We don't have any particular right to buy it. It's really up to Catalyst, you know, Macerich, you know, has a right to buy it. I'm not going to really get into that.\nScenario.\nWhat happens. We've been very active on buying boxes, redeveloping our centers. I think everybody knows that. But as I said earlier, purchase price matters, and you know, we are very focused on paying the right price on any given particular.\nScenario. But again, you gotta be careful that going from.\nFrom what PropCo is selling to Simon Property Group, there's a company called Catalyst that operates those stores. We're a shareholder in it. And it's a complex matter and beyond that, other than to say.\nWe've been very active in buying boxes, you know, since you know all the various restrictions that have been going on. But we're going to pay the right price.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nNow, that just maybe to summarize and confirm, is it kind of fair to summarize that it seems like there's probably more complexities in this structure versus, you know, this is not an indication that Simon is less interested in buying anchor boxes or, you know, the appetite has changed. I mean, that's kind of what I read through, but just want to kind of confirm that's a fair categorization.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYou can confirm. First of all.\nIt's related. PropCo has a relationship with OpCo, which is Catalyst. We have no relationship. Simon Property Group has no relationship with PropCo.\nNone.\nSo we have a relationship with Catalyst because they're, you know, in some cases they're a tenant to us. In some cases they're not a tenant to us, but they operate a J.C. Penney store in our malls. So you can't go from.\nYou know, whatever the name of that Copper Property. Copper Property to Simon Property. You can't make that link and say, oh, Simon's not interested in the boxes. Would I be interested in all the OpCo boxes?\nNo, not necessarily. Would I be interested in the Simon boxes? Potentially sure. But then I would fall back and want the right prices. You follow what I'm saying? Then you can't go from there to Simon Property Group. Yes, there's a step function in there. Okay.\nBut the simple answer to your question is do not read.\nYou're right, do not read any intent from Simon Property Group due to that transaction. We'll see if it even closes. You know, you know, deals get announced, but they don't close. Tariffs get announced, but they don't close. You know, so let's see what closes when and how and we'll take it from there.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nGreat.\nThank you. Appreciate all that color.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, good evening out there, David. I guess I was intrigued by your commentary earlier that the cap rate for asset was higher than recent open-air strip asset cap rates. So I guess I'm curious that that's more of a unique dynamic to this transaction because you were, I guess, the only logical bidder here or if perhaps you have some additional color or thought you'd like to share on the asset pricing for top quality malls versus quality open-air. And then any thoughts on what you see as a long-term opportunity either from a mark-to-market or densification opportunity at Brickell? Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, I just think we're great at finding opportunities and we don't, you know, we don't participate. Rarely do we participate in auctions. Auctions get, you know, when our friends at Eastdil or what are some of the other brokers, when they run a process, man, they're going to find, usually it's pretty, you know, it's pretty tough.\nWe like to find opportunities.\nI have all the respect in the world for those guys. They're doing their job. But we like to, you know, figure out how to do it without that. And you know, I think.\nThe market does not recognize.\nThe value.\nOf.\nSomething like Brickell. Brickell should have been sold at an auction at a.\nHigher price than what we paid. But the market.\nIt's mispriced when it comes to high quality. You know, Brickell's not enclosed by any stretch of the imagination. The market misprices big retail. In this case, it has a roof, it has a moving roof, still got all sorts of stuff to it.\nBut the market misprices.\nWhich is good for us because we can take advantage of it. And I'm letting the cat out of the bag, which is probably pretty stupid. But the market, absolutely unequivocally misprices big enclosed.\nCenter shopping centers.\nBecause if you look at the cash flow growth and the longevity, forget about it. But you know, but that's, that's fine with us and it's good for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nRon Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, just coming back to domestic property NOI, I see 3.8% year to date. I think you talked about at least 3% for the year, and then you made some interesting comments about how, whether it's tariff or the strong dollar, may be holding back some of the centers. Just wondering if you could just comment on how you guys see that shaping for the rest of the year and if there's any way to quantify what sort of this headwind is doing to that number so we get a sense what a true run rate can be.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, look, we're outperforming our year to date. Even with the volatility of the.\nYou.\nNow, the tariffs that were announced in April, the consumer is.\nHolding on. We don't update our, you know, our guidance constantly. Oh, there's a lot that goes into it.\nBut you know, we're very confident we're going to beat that number and have a very strong year. And you know, like I said, I think recent demand continues unabated.\nSales is always a little bit out of our control.\nBut you know, we'll have to see how that evolves. And you know, the.\nYou know, the.\nYou know, we're seeing pretty good sales results even up to today and a pretty good back to school season. So.\nWe'll see how the rest of these shakes out.\n\nRon Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Linda Tsai, Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nHi. I think it was in response to Alex's question earlier, you were discussing acquisitions in the context of deepening relationships with retailers. What are some of the examples of this? Because I would think that you have a lot of negotiating power with the majority of retailers.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, we really, I mean.\nRetailers have all the power because they can go across the street or, you know, or close the store or.\nGo online.\nYou know, leave the market. So.\nBut the more product you have available to them, the better the relationship. So it's just a commercial relationship.\nIf IBM sell, if Microsoft sells Outlook to.\nA big company, they're going to be able to sell other products to that company. So, you know, it's no different. You know, we're, you know, if we could talk about 20 things as opposed to three things, it just means we'll have a longer meeting. And maybe. And if they have confidence in our ability to deliver a good product, you know, maybe we'll have 21 things. But, you know, don't kid yourself. These retailers have all the leverage because they can close stores, go across the street, or leave the market, or do their business online. And, you know.\nThat's. And you know, we're the one begging for the new business. So I just think the more product you have, the better you are and the more likely you are to have more senior focus.\nFrom that retailer. Just like, you know, if you're selling widgets, if you have a bigger portfolio, you're able to spend more time with the customer. And that, you know, that's just commercial common sense. And, you know, they have faith in our ability to deliver a good product.\nHave confidence, you know, that we'll operate the center appropriately. You know, that's why we're able to do a lot of repeat business.\nThere's no, you know, there's nothing more to that than that. But believe me, they got the leverage because they don't have to operate the store.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nHong Zang\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, hey, David, I mean, you've talked about how you expect Brickell to be great because people are moving from New York and Chicago over to the area, I guess. Have you seen the opposite impact in your New York centers, like, say, Westchester or Roosevelt Field?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, first of all, Brickell is really, really good. This is not a troubled asset. Right.\nI just want to, you know, just want to make sure you understand that.\nYour second part, your second part.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nI guess, are you seeing a negative?\n\nHong Zang\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nImpact in your New York assets like Roosevelt Field, Westchester? If people are migrating outside of New York?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI don't think it's going to affect Long Island.\nI think New York City, I'd be nervous about urban environment. Yeah, I mean, I do. You know, there's a lot of, lot of great stuff in New York City, but I think the suburbs.\nYou know, by the way, we've seen the suburbs have a renaissance, you know, primarily due to COVID. Right? So.\nI think the suburbs of New York City and suburban New Jersey.\nJersey City.\nLong Island, Westchester County.\nAll could benefit.\nYou know, depending on, you know, what happens with the city. But. So I don't think it's. I don't know if this is a New York issue or I think it's more of a New York City issue.\n\nHong Zang\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nGot it.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHi, yes, good evening.\n\nTayo Okusanya\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI am curious about the secured loan transactions this quarter.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAgain, you guys have an A credit.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nA lot of your peers are kind of doing unsecured around 5%. Curious why you guys decided the best thing to do was the secured loans at 5.84%.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI don't know whether that's a duration thing. Mortgage financing? Yeah, that's a mortgage, yeah, the mortgage financing, yeah, it's with the JV partner. So we wouldn't want to use our balance sheet for a JV partner.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nI mean, 10-year unsecured debt for us today is right around 5%. So on the unsecured market, we're right on top of the market where others are issuing.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nIt should be. I agree it should be 4%. By the way, I agree with President Trump. Interest rates should be lower.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nI hear you, David. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Chairman David Simon for closing remarks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAll right, thank you. Hope you enjoyed our call.\nI know Tom and Brian are available for follow-ups. Thank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect their lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

I am pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nGood evening. I'm pleased with our financial and operational results in the Q4, concluding an exceptional year for our company. We reported record total funds from operations of $4.9 billion, or $12.99 cents per share. We generated $4.6 billion in real estate FFO, or $12.24 cents per share, which was growth of 3.9% year over year. We returned a record of more than $3 billion to shareholders in cash dividends, and now we have paid approximately $45 billion to shareholders in dividends over our history as a public company. We saw record leasing, retail sales volume, and occupancy gains for the year. We completed last week the acquisition of The Mall, two well-known luxury outlet centers in Italy, from Kering. We look forward to adding these high-quality luxury assets into our global portfolio while continuing to build upon their success.\nWe opened a new fully leased premium outlet in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and we completed 16 significant redevelopment projects during the year. Development and redevelopment opportunities are growing within our portfolio. We levered our A-rated balance sheet, providing additional capacity and flexibility to fund future growth. I'm now going to turn it over to Brian, who will cover our Q4 results in more detail and provide our outlook for 2025.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, David. Real estate FFO was $3.35 cents per share in the Q4 compared to $3.23 cents in the prior year, 3.7% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.18 of growth. During the quarter, we sold assets that resulted in a tax benefit, which partially offset the prior tax expense from our ABG sale and essentially offset a write-off of pre-development costs associated with a joint venture development project in California. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,500 leases for 6.1 million sq ft in the quarter. For the year, we signed a record 5,500 leases for more than 21 million sq ft. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals. Malls and outlet occupancy at the end of the Q4 was 96.5%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year.\nOur year-end occupancy is the highest level over the last eight years. The Mills occupancy was 98.8%, an increase of 1%, and is at a record level. Average base minimum rent for the malls and outlets increased 2.5% year over year, and The Mills increased 4.3%. Retailer sales per square foot was $739 for the year. Strong revenue growth across our businesses, combined with expense discipline, resulted in a 100 basis point increase year over year in our industry-leading operating margin. Our occupancy cost at the end of the year was 13%. Domestic NOI increased 4.4% year over year for the quarter and 4.7% for the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at a constant currency, grew 4.5% for the quarter and 4.6% for the year. Q4 funds from operations were $1.39 billion, or $3.68 per share, compared to $1.38 billion, or $3.69 per share last year.\nQ4 results include $0.20 cents per share of non-cash after-tax gain from the combination of JCPenney and SPARC Group. The mark-to-market fair value of Klépierre's exchangeable bonds increased year over year, which offset a lower contribution from OPI operations. As a reminder, the prior year results include $0.33 cents per share in gain from the sale of part of our interest in ABG last year. Turning to new development and redevelopment. This year, we will open our first premium outlets in Jakarta, Indonesia, in March and expect to begin construction on four to five mixed-use projects throughout the year. We expect to fund these redevelopments and mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after our dividend payments. Other platform investments. JCPenney and SPARC Group combined to form a portfolio of iconic retailer banners called Catalyst Brands.\nCatalyst Brands brings together SPARC's brands: Aéropostale, Brooks Brothers, Eddie Bauer, Lucky and Nautica, with JCPenney in its exclusive private brands. Catalyst Brands sold Reebok in early January and is currently evaluating strategic options for Forever 21. We view the Catalyst transaction as a positive development that will create significant synergies with a solid balance sheet that will enable the company to drive EBITDA growth. Catalyst shareholders include Simon, Brookfield, Authentic Brands Group, and Shein. Turning to the balance sheet. During 2024, we completed $11 billion in financing activities, including issuing $1 billion in senior notes for the 10-year term and a 4.75% interest rate. We recast our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with maturity extended to January of 2030 and no change in pricing or terms, and completed over $6 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions.\nLastly, we delivered our balance sheet by approximately $1.5 billion in the year and ended the year at 5.2x net debt to EBITDA. Our A-rated balance sheet provides a distinct advantage with more than $10 billion of liquidity at year-end. Additionally, today, relative to our dividends, we announced a dividend of $2.10 cents per share for the Q1, a year-over-year increase of 7.7%. The dividend is payable on 31 March. Now, moving on to our 2025 guidance. Our real estate FFO guidance range is $12.40 to 12.65 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2024 of between $0.25 to 0.30 cents per share, reflecting current market interest rates and projected cash balances compared to 2024. Lastly, our diluted share count of approximately 377 million shares and units outstanding.\nDue to the recent Catalyst Brands transaction, we will not include Catalyst guidance at this time. We expect there will be significant savings and synergies from the combination that will be coupled with potential restructuring costs. We expect Catalyst will generate positive EBITDA in fiscal 2025 and roughly break-even FFO as they work through the combination. With that, thank you, and David and I are now available for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session.

You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Spector\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. I know you'll get through some of the numbers through some of the other questions. I wanted to focus on some of the initiatives you have to bring people to the mall. I know you have the Tomorrow Stars, the Meet Me at the Mall. When your traffic was up at malls, premium outlets. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the programs and initiatives that you're doing to, again, bring the shopper to the mall, and how did those programs go for the holiday season? Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, listen, I think we're leaders in this area. Our national advertising campaign is all about talking about how it's fun to go to the mall and hang out, just like in the 80s and '90s. We had a very good reception to it. We rebranded Simon Premium Outlets to Shop Simon. We're in the midst of creating our loyalty program. And then, obviously, we've got events, thousands of events that drive traffic through the year, whether it's breast cancer awareness programs, Valentine's Day, basically every major event that occurs within the US, we try to drive an event around that, Easter, down the road. So I couldn't be prouder of our marketing efforts. They're very digital. They're very fun. They use new media in a lot of ways. And I just expect more and more. And more importantly, we're seeing return on investment.\nWe've got the data to prove that. Not that our peer group is wide and deep, but to the extent that it is, there's nobody doing more when it comes to data, digital commerce with Shop Simon, marketing, events. You put it all together, we're leaps and bounds compared to what else is out there.\n\nJeff Spector\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Sakwa\n\nSenior Managing Director,Equities, Evercore ISI\n\nYes, thanks. Good evening. David, you guys obviously had a great year with 21 million sq ft of leasing, occupancy up. Given where you're sitting on the occupancy side, I'm just curious how the discussions that your leasing team are having with the retailers is kind of shifting and maybe talk about the pricing power and how that's kind of returned to the mall for the A's. And to tie that into NOI growth, you've talked about greater than 3%, but you've certainly beaten 4% for the last three years in a row. So what are we missing on the 3% front? And maybe just comment on pricing power. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, let me just talk about the 3%. So look, as we did last year, we budget flat sales. Why? I don't really know, but that's what we do. And when you do that, we come up with a conservative number. To the extent that we have sales growth like we did this year, again, maybe not overall, but the retailers that matter, we generate over-trend, which obviously pops our NOI growth. So I hope we're being conservative. Obviously, there's pretty good animal spirits in the US and its economy. We expect to participate in that. And again, I don't like the word pricing power. I just think we're able to have deep relationships with our retailers, and we're able to generate a lot of new business.\nWe see new retailers approach us all the time and new uses all the time, which essentially allows us to, and one of the big things to growth, we're never stuck with the tenant mix that we have. So what, and I think Brian knows the number specifically, but I think 25% of our leases this year were new. So what's driving a lot of what we do is we're able to take the retailers that aren't doing the sales and replace them with ones that will. And that, because they'll do better volume, that drives rent growth. And I don't call that pricing power. I just think that's improving our mix and doing what we need to do to drive our business forward.\nAnd as I said, I think last call is we still think we have an opportunity because, frankly, we've been organizationally very focused on the, for no better word, the A's. We do think there's real effort, focus, growth for us in the B's where we're investing our dollars. So that's a big program for us in 2025 and 2026. And just to cap off your question, we still feel, and again, it's hard to predict because there's always downtime, tenant bankruptcies, etc., but we still feel like we have upside in our occupancy. We're still not at our high. That was 1997, 2001, if I remember right, in 2014. I'm shaking his head yes. So we still, some message to my leasing team if they're listening.\nI don't mind if they're not, if they're making a lease, but assuming they're listening, let's get up to our record high in 2014, and then we'll take a deep breath, but we won't until then.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Maybe just following off the last one, right? The NOI expectation dropped from 4% last year and for the last several years down to 3%. So bridging the gap between those expectations, right? It sounds like some of that is retail sales, but it sounds like occupancy, there's still upside, but is there the same magnitude of upside? And then also, are you taking into account any sort of tenant bankruptcies or credit reserve in that as well, which is driving that by 100 basis points? Thanks.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nHey, Michael, it's Brian. So I think first, we've historically put out at least 3% at the beginning of every year, including last year, and then have subsequently beat that, which we've repeated here. I think you just heard David talk about the overage component. We budgeted, assumed sales were flat, so there's a negative component tree mathematically to overage in the subsequent year. You heard us just talk about mix. And so as we swap out tenants for new tenants, there is downtime specifically associated with our full-price business as we build out those stores. Last thing I would mention, you just mentioned bad debt. Our numbers in 2025 take into consideration our historical approach to bad debt. We did slightly better than that in 2024, but we've taken an appropriate expectation into 2025 relative to our standard approach.\nSo those are the three major drivers that would get you kind of back from this year's number down to a 3% number for, again, as a baseline starting in 25. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Craig Mailman from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Joseph\n\nHead of US Real Estate- Real Estate and Lodging Research Team, Citi\n\nThanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, just want to touch on the potential impact for tariffs. Obviously, the news keeps changing. But just broadly, what are you hearing from your retailers? How is it impacting their business, kind of the uncertainty there, and the potential impact of the de minimis exemption going away?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I don't know. It's interesting. Just our firsthand, I don't know where every retailer sources their goods. But if you take Catalyst as an example, they only source 20% of their goods, with all the brands, about 20% in China. Okay? And when we talk to Catalyst, their view of it is, with respect to China, that they'll pass some of it on to the consumer, but also hope that the supplier tightens up the cost of goods sold. So many, many retailers have moved a lot of production out of China over the last several years. And the good news is where we had kind of the most exposure was shoes, which Reebok would have been more exposed. But as you know, we disposed of the Reebok operating business in January.\nSo, no one is really honestly; it hasn't affected day-to-day decision-making, and it's a relatively reduced amount for the retailers. What's really going to be helpful to the American retailers and the non-Chinese retailers is to get rid of the de minimis rule, which basically exempts tariffs if you send a package over $800 to a customer. That's not a level playing field. That causes retailers to pay more that ship in bulk. And it's given real benefits to someone like Temu, where they've shipped purposely under the $800. Congress is taking it up. I know the president is taking it up. And that will absolutely be, if enacted, will give a real shot in the arm to retailers that don't purposely try to send their goods to get under the $800 limitation. Not only to say it's also more green, it saves packaging costs, etc.\nIt's good for our country. I hope Congress and or the president enact it. That, to me, is more material than any tariffs that are being talked about.\n\nNick Joseph\n\nHead of US Real Estate- Real Estate and Lodging Research Team, Citi\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please go ahead.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director, Compass Point\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. Good to hear your voice, David. A couple of questions, but I guess I'm going to focus on your latest acquisition in Italy. I note that Kering just snuck into your top 10 list this past quarter prior to the acquisition. Curious if you can talk about that acquisition, the returns that you expect to achieve, how you might be able to manage those assets going forward. And also, what would Kering's percentage have been had they been included? I guess I know your top 10 is domestic only, but how much of an impact would that have on the top 10 if you were to include Kering's exposure in Europe as well?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, on that particular point, you'll see that in our next supplement. So it'll go up, but you'll see that in our next supplement. Look, I would say we're under a confidentiality agreement on the details other than the price. I will tell you we've been very, as you know, very selective on acquisitions, and we're only buying top stuff at the right price. This follows 100% of that strategy. So it's top stuff at the right price. Kering will remain a long-term tenant in that they've had historically a very competent group that ran it for them, obviously, because that's not their main business, as you know. We've taken over that team. We'll help them with strategic guidance, and we think there's upside in the business. We think it's NAV accretive for us. We also think it's earnings accretive for us.\nIt, again, is something we wanted to do years and years ago, but they weren't ready to do it. We're extremely excited about doing it. The location, Italy's in a renaissance. It's got one of the positive growths in the EU. These are the kind of deals we want to do. Buy it at the right price. It's accretive to NAV, accretive to earnings, but it's also high quality with the right retailers. We couldn't have picked a better asset in terms of this.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nManaging Director, Compass Point\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Forrest.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good evening. David, following up on your comment regarding the focus on B mall investments in 2025, 2026, are you able to talk about the types of investments that you make in those malls, whether it differs from how you would approach investing in an A mall, and then any detail on the magnitude of those investments and expected return? Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I'll just be very generic. Brian can lay it out for you later. But to me, it's a whole combination of things. These are important assets in the communities. We've been focused on the bigger assets historically. So it's a combination of adding boxes, updating the look and feel of the place, restaurants, and tenants. Everyone changes a little bit differently. But I'll just take Smith Haven as an example. We're going to. I got to be careful because I don't know if I can announce it, even though the lease is signed. So I think an announcement's coming. This is in basically Eastern Long Island where we're going to update, renovate the property, add a great retailer in a huge box. We just added Primark. Hospital just opened up their one of their health facilities.\nThat will probably be about a 12% return over the next couple of years. It'll be a renovated, rejuvenated asset that, because of all the progress we've made in the bigger ones, we're able to kind of re-energize our focus on an asset like that. But the list of those is long. So Brian can go through it, but that's just one that kind of jumps to top of mind. To my team, I'm supposed to see a press release on that, but I haven't seen it. So please move that along.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nPhone one disconnected.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHello?\n\nOperator\n\nI'm sorry. Next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nHey. Good evening, David. Good to hear you. And I'm sure the people out of Smith Haven will appreciate the dollar spent. Question on your guidance for 2025. Obviously, very good versus expectations despite the headwinds on the interest expense that Brian laid out. So my question is, is this back to sort of the old Simon days, pre-pandemic, where you guys just had strong internal growth that was accelerating, or is this more about removing OPI drag from the future? I'm just trying to understand if this is just all the Simon, but not yet leases taking effect, or if truly the underlying portfolio is accelerating and we're going back to where you guys used to be pre-pandemic when the core portfolio was really just humming along.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, the $1,240 to $1,265 excludes Catalyst. The other investments in OPI are small. So, they're, and again, they're. Neither FFO is probably the wrong way to look at those investments, but they run through FFO anyway because they're; one's an asset management company, and then one's an e-commerce marketplace and an e-commerce retailer. And so FFO is the least important metric on those, but they run through our numbers. So Catalyst is outside of that number. And I don't like the word old, Alex, but yeah, no, we're growing the portfolio. We said at least 3%. I think we said at least 3% the last two years, maybe three. I don't remember. Three years, Brian's saying. So hopefully, we can beat that.\nAnd that's basically all the stuff that leads to that, which is leasing, focused operational margins, events, Simon Brand Ventures, replacing boxes, restaurants, all of the basics. And we still see that. I think we've had a pretty good run. Forget the big juice that we got back from getting back to business after we were unreasonably shut down by various state governments. But we've been clipping along four-plus percent, even though we guided to three. And let's see how this year transpires. But we've got a lot going for us, and the biggest of which is a great team, leasings focused. We feel that there's upside in the portfolio across the board, but primarily in our historical bread and butter properties. We're going to do smart deals. We're prudent. We have a hell of a balance sheet. And I think we're lease, lease, lease.\nI think it's not overly complicated. Then Catalyst, well, it's obviously a big six months as they go through it. We'll have a better sense of kind of it will be positive EBITDA for sure. We'll have a better idea of FFO as the year progresses. But just to be clear, it's not in our number as of what we've guided to in the $1,240 to $1,265.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Good to see the magic.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nUS REITs Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Great to hear your voice, David, as well. Just a question on the leasing. Looks like about 5% is still month to month. I think that's still kind of above where you were pre-COVID in 2019. So just curious on how you think that will evolve over time. It's just like a second or part B of a question. How has the S&O pipeline changed, if at all, over time? Could you just give us where it is as of year-end, please?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nHey, Juan. It's Brian. S&O at the year-end was about 250 basis points as we brought occupancy on in the Q4. And you saw that in the numbers. Month to month, as we move leases through our leasing process, ultimately, not everything gets signed at the same time. So we put that into that category. Nothing there. We're in the process of renewals and year-end leasing. And so ultimately, we would expect that number to come down throughout the year.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI just would say we're slightly for the life of me. I don't understand why it takes so long. Put that aside, we do get our leases signed up. We are slightly ahead of where we were last year on our renewals and signed, I should say. We've got commitments on a lot of them. Sure.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Vince Tabone from Green Street. Please go ahead.\n\nVince Tabone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nHi, good evening. I have a few questions related to the mixed-use projects you mentioned earlier. So what is the expected pro rata spend on the four to five mixed-use projects to break ground in 2025? And also, what's the common structure? Are you doing this primarily on your own balance sheet or using joint venture partners and the non-retail component? And then also, is it mostly residential? Or what are some of the other non-retail property types in there? Sorry for the multiple questions.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I'll follow up. Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt you. So it'll be around $400 to 500 million. And again, when I look at the ones that we're expecting to start this year, they're all JVs. And they will run from residential to a couple of hotels to office. And just to give you a sense, what's in that category, we expect to start a hotel in Roosevelt Field, a big residential project in Brea, office at Clearfork. And we're expanding a hotel at The Domain in Austin, Texas. Those are all pretty much planned for. I would expect Vince to add to that this year. As you know, we've got Northgate under construction. We are going to somewhat accelerate if we can. Anything we're planning in California, I am very nervous about construction costs there given the horrific events in Southern Cal.\nSo we're looking at a couple of projects there that we might push before what's going on there. But I would expect us to add more to the pipeline. But those are kind of the ones that were pretty much don't even got a shovel on the ground and they over. But those are all pretty much baked in the cake. And in this case, they all happen to be JVs, but that could change.\n\nVince Tabone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nNo, that's really helpful. If I can maybe just get one more clarification. When you say joint ventures, is Simon typically like a 10% or 20% partner in the non-retail portion, or are you an 80% owner of the non-retail? Just trying to get a sense of appetite for non-retail.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. No, no, no. Vince, you're usually 50/50.\n\nVince Tabone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nYeah. Great. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. No problem. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Mike Miller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Miller [VP\n\nStrategy and Information] (JPMorgan)\n\nYeah. Hi. I know you can't talk about the current pricing, but what's your sense as to how pricing on a comparable-quality US assets would compare today? Do you think it'd be similar, stronger, or weaker?\n\nOperator\n\nOnly US assets.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI missed the question. Can you say it one more? I didn't understand. Can you rephrase it?\n\nMike Miller [VP\n\nStrategy and Information] (JPMorgan)\n\nYeah. So yeah, I was saying on the Italy purchase, we know you can't talk about the cap rate and the economics. But just curious as a hypothetical, if you have something comparable quality in the US, how would you imagine the pricing would compare to what you were in for in Italy? Do you think it would be stronger, higher cap rate, lower cap rate, something similar? Just curious of the thoughts there.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nIt's a good question, and I'm trying to think if I can answer it. I'll try to be artful. I would say let me do a macro statement about Italy. Usually, macro are that even though properties are powerful and comparable, they'll tend to have higher cap rates than they would to the US. And obviously, that calculus is important as to how we think about things.\n\nMike Miller [VP\n\nStrategy and Information] (JPMorgan)\n\nGot it.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHow was that? Okay. How was that?\n\nOperator\n\nThat was good. I think you pointed in the direction. There you go.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay.\n\nMike Miller [VP\n\nStrategy and Information] (JPMorgan)\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, everyone. Maybe just another question on kind of acquisitions or capital allocation generally, but it sounds like you were targeting the Kering acquisition for a while, and I imagine there are many other deals that you've assessed over the past couple of years. So I was wondering if you could talk about the rest of the acquisition properties that might be out there that could be attractive to you and how you're balancing perhaps buying those versus your stock versus more redevelopment versus increasing the dividend, realizing that you're kind of doing a little bit of all of that.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Listen, I would say, Caitlin, that there's no big deal that is on the drawing board. So we're still interested in a few high-quality transactions. We're working on them. There's no guarantee. But I think since there's no big deal, we're going to do it all. And that's kind of my philosophy right now. So we may, if there were a big deal to do, you can define big deal, but several billion dollars, billions of dollars, let's say, then we might have to readjust our thinking. But I think we're going to the mindset right now is we can do it all. Remember, we delevered. And so we're still working on a couple of high-quality transactions, but they're not going to tip the scales from a leverage, financial consequence, or capacity point of view. And as you know, development, redevelopment is a three-year project.\nJust, you build a house, you buy a house, it's one thing. When you build it, you got three years to stroke the check every year or every month, unless you have a really nice contractor. So honestly, I think we're going to do it all, redevelop. We don't mind buying our stock back. Obviously, subject to market conditions, we have the capacity to do so. And then I think redevelopment, development. We announced Nashville. We're really excited about that land. It's in the growth quarter. It's on an interstate. Great, great ingress, egress, visibility. Terrific long-term, 100 hectare site. So we've got stuff going on in Asia on development. Nothing really on new development in Europe. So just maybe a couple of things here or there. But we're also looking at expanding some of our better assets like a Woodbury or a Toronto Premium Outlet or Desert Hills, etc.\nSo that stuff is high priority. So right now, obviously, things change. But right now, we're planning to keep operating the same way we're operating. A little bit of everything.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nSounds like a lot of opportunity. Great. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey there. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And good to hear you, David. My question, I guess, I wanted to go back a bit more to your plan on investing a bit more in your B assets here. I guess I'm curious how you're able to generate the 12% returns versus, I think, the 8% to 9% we've seen in more of your A projects here the last couple of years. Is it the lower rent bases? Are you seeing, I guess, any sense of stronger demand for space in any of those B malls? And is 12% more of an anomaly or more the norm for these B mall investments you're making? Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I think the simple thing is right now we have little to no income. But when we always give you a number on return, we're always backing out existing income. But in this case, if you have an empty box or empty space, there's no existing income. And that really drives kind of the incremental return. That's the biggest element of it. And they're not all the 12%, I kind of refer to what we see at Smith Haven, but they're not all that way. But in a lot of cases, it's just empty space or an empty box. And it's income. Basically, there's no offset against it because there's no existing retailer. And then it's just the capital we have to put in to do it.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGot it. I appreciate that. And just thinking about that 12%, is that kind of reflective of the incremental risk return or risk premium perhaps for some of these assets? Just curious how that perhaps would.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI think that's a good point, but I would recharacterize. So let's say there's an A, and again, our B malls are probably some people's better than A malls. But let's just take a B mall. And where we think the value very simplistically is an A cap rate, okay? We wouldn't want to invest in that asset at a 6 cap return, because that would be diluted to NAV. So part of what you're going to see and are seeing is we really look to improve that kind of portfolio. If we can't make NAV accretive investments, we won't do it. So we're better off in that case just managing the cash flow to the best of our abilities. So I understand your point. I kind of recharacterized it, not because of risk. It's not really risk adjusted.\nIt's more what's the value of the asset, and will this add to the value of that asset? Follow what I'm saying?\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAbsolutely. That's partly what I was getting at. I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nYes. Hi. Regarding the comment that you buy only really good stuff after carrying, do you see more opportunities abroad or domestically?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI would say mostly domestic just because it's got to be really unique, which is what we saw the mall, which is rare. And again, as I mentioned earlier, I think I talked to them, hard to remember, but it was definitely a couple of years pre-COVID. So I just think there's very few jewels like that in Europe that make sense with what we do in Europe, if you understand what I'm saying. So we're not going to buy a mall in Europe just to have one mall in Europe. So the outlet business, we view a little differently. So I would say because of that, it's got to be really unique and more domestic. I'd say more domestic.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nThanks. How are you feeling about the consumer right now? High versus low-end, US versus Europe?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I think they're very cautious in Europe. The US consumer is. I'm still nervous about the lower-end consumer. They're better to the upper income. I feel pretty confident about that. A lot of whipsaws going on left and right, so it's very hard to predict. But generally, still concerned about the lower-end, pretty bullish on the upper to high-end consumer.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REITs and CRE Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Hey, if we could just go back to sort of the strong performance last year, wondering if we could dig in a little bit between sort of the outlets and the mall business, any sort of callout, what drove the performance? Is it traffic? Is it higher ticket prices, so on and so forth? And the second part of the question is really, are you seeing any impact from the strong dollar on tourist centers? Thanks.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nSo, Ron, it's Brian. There wasn't a big bifurcation, kind of, between asset classes. I think all three platforms performed exceedingly well. You did see the outlets and the Mills, which generally skew a little bit more value-oriented, outperform a little bit into the Q4. It wasn't really kind of an anomaly, just kind of expected performance. And we've not seen any real-time impact yet to the tourist-oriented centers, but we're 4 February, so still early in the year. But we would expect to see, or if we continue to see dollar strength, can see some impact over the course of the year, certainly in our translations of our foreign earnings.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REITs and CRE Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. And I would just say when we talk about re-energizing on B assets, don't just think malls. Think outlets, think a few of our Mills. So it's a wide portfolio focus. Just when people talk B, they always think malls. But for us, it's across our entire domestic portfolio.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Head of US REITs and CRE Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHelpful. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to David Simon for any closing comments.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Thank you, everybody. Look forward to talking in the future. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYou may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",

Simon\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nGood evening, everyone. I'm pleased with our financial and operational performance in the second quarter. We are seeing increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains shopper traffic and retail sales volumes resulting in a company's highest level of real estate NOI for the second quarter in our company's history. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady. Our company is focused on creating value through unique and disciplined investment activities that will continue to deliver long-term growth in cash flow, funds from operations and dividends, as you've seen by our recent increase in our dividend per share, and importantly, make our properties better for the communities in which they operate.\nI'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, who will cover our second quarter results and the full year guidance in more detail.\n\nBrian J. McDade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.09 billion or $2.90 per share compared to [ $1.800 billion ] or $2.88 per share last year. SFO from our real estate business was $2.93 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.81 in the prior year, a 4.3% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.12 of growth. As a reminder, the prior year included a noncash gain of $0.07 from investment activity related to ABG.\nDomestic NOI increased 5.2% year-over-year for the quarter. Continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.8% for the quarter.\nMalls and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 95.6%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The Mills occupancy was 98.2%, average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year, and The Mills increased 3.9%. As David mentioned, leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,400 leases for approximately 4.8 million square feet in the quarter. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity in the second quarter was new deal volume. Our traffic in the second quarter was up 5% compared to last year. And importantly, Total sales volumes increased approximately 2% year-over-year.\nReported retailer sales per square foot in the second quarter was $741 for The Mall and premium outlets combined. We hosted our third annual National outlet shopping day in June, and it was very successful for shoppers participating retailers. More than 3 million shoppers visit our premium outlets and Mill centers over the shopping weekend. Feedback from shoppers and retailers following the event has been great. Since launching this unique event three years ago, participating retailer and shopping momentum has built each year with more than 475 retailers this year, and we look forward to an even a bigger event next year. Our occupancy cost at the end of the second quarter was 12.7%.\nTurning to new development and redevelopment. We will open our Tulsa Premium Outlets on August 15 at 100% leased and we will also open a significant expansion at Busan Premium outlets in South Korea this fall. We also started construction the quarter on our first phase of a new luxury residential development in North gas station. This project will include 234 units and add other elements that further transforms Northgate into the ultimate live, work, scape, stay in shop destination. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the U.S. and internationally, with our share of net cost of $1.1 billion and a [ net ] yield of 8%.\nNow to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 10 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of approximately $1.1 billion at an average rate of 6.36%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity.\nTurning to the dividend. Today, we announced our dividend of $2.05 per share for the third quarter a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. The dividend is payable on September 30.\nAnd now finally for guidance. We are increasing our full year 2024 guidance range to [ $12.80 a $12.90 ] per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint and reflects overcoming approximately $0.15 per share from certain retailer restructurings, low-release settlement and land sales, land sales income this year.\nWith that, that concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you, and David and I are now available for your questions.",

Simon\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nGood evening. We're off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.33 billion or $3.56 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share last year. Let me walk you through some highlights for this quarter compared to Q1 of '23. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.09 of growth driven by higher rental income. Gains from investment activity in the first quarter were approximately $0.75 higher year-over-year. OPI had a $0.02 after-tax lower contribution compared to last year.\nFunds from operation from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the first quarter compared to $2.82 in the prior year period, a 3.2% growth rate domestic property NOI increased 3.7% year-over-year. We have continued leasing momentum resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered these results that were above our plan for the first quarter.\nPortfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 3.9% for the quarter. NOI from OPI in the first quarter includes a $33 million charge in onetime restructuring charges at SPARC and JCPenney. Excluding these onetime charges and a bargain purchase gain from Reebok transaction last year, NOI from OPI improved $5 million year-over-year and was on plan for the quarter. Remember, these retailers are on a fiscal year end of January 31, and the charges were part of the year-end closing process. They were not budgeted.\nMall and occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year Mills was 97.7%. Average base minimum rent for our malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and at the Mills, 3.8% increase. Leasing momentum continued. As I mentioned, we signed more than 1,300 leases for approximately 6.3 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We are approximately 65% complete with our 24 lease expirations, and we continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community.\nRetail sales volume across the portfolio increased 2.3% for the first quarter compared to last year. Our tourist-oriented properties outperformed the portfolio average in the quarter with a 6% increase in sales. Reported retail sales per square foot in the first quarter was $745 a foot for our outlets and malls combined, which was flat year-over-year, excluding 2 retailers -- retail sales per square foot from our premium outlet platform reached an all-time high this quarter.\nOccupancy costs at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%. Now let me talk about other platform investments affectionately known as OPI. We sold our remaining interest in Authentic Brands Group during the first quarter for gross proceeds of close to $1.2 billion and recorded a pretax and after-tax gain of $415 million and $311 million, respectively.\nThe sale in the first quarter, combined with the sale in the fourth quarter, yielded gross proceeds of $1.45 billion. We generated substantial value from the ABG investment and a 7x multiple on our net invested capital during our short ownership period. As a result of the sale of ABG and the restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier, onetime in nature at SPARC and Penny in the first quarter, we now expect FFO contribution from OPI to be around breakeven this year compared to the initial guidance of $0.10 to $0.15.\nFor your reference, we budgeted the -- at OPI, the FFO from ABG around $0.08 per share. So roughly half of that was associated with ABG. Now moving on to new development and redevelopment. We opened an AC Hotel at St. John Center. We are opening [ Tulsa ] Premium Outlets this summer, leasing is going great. and we have a significant expansion at [indiscernible] premium outlets in South Korea this fall. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across our platforms in the U.S. and internationally as well with our share of net cost of $930 million at a blended yield of 8%.\nWe expect to start construction on additional projects in the next few months, including just shortly, our residential project at Northgate Station in Seattle, what's interesting for us is we're able to build when others need to rely on construction lending market, which is, as you might imagine, very difficult right now. We expect our starts to be around $500 million this year.\nNow on our balance sheet, we retired $600 million of senior notes in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the second quarter a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The dividend is payable on June 28. And given the transactions for this quarter and our results for this quarter, our current view for the remainder of the year, we're increasing the full range our full year guidance of 2024 in the guidance range of $11.85 to 12 -- I'm sorry, -- let me restate that. We're increasing our range to $12.75 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.90 at the bottom end of the range and $0.85 at the midpoint. Needless to say, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and our business and tenant demand continues to remain strong. Despite a cloudy macro environment, occupancy is increasing, property NOI is growing. We made a significant profit on our ABG investment, and everything is kind of moving in all the right directions.\nThank you. We're ready for questions.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect the request to limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nGood evening. I'm pleased to report our Q3 results. Q3 Funds From Operations were $1.2 billion, or $3.20 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to the same quarter of 2022. Domestic and international operations had a very good performance this quarter and contributed $0.17 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Non-cash after-tax gains, gains of $0.32 in the Q3, were related to the partial sale of our ownership interest in SPARC and ABG as a result of ABG selling primary shares in the quarter. Higher interest expense was a setback of $0.07 year-over-year. We had a $0.15 lower contribution from our other property investment platform compared to Q3 2022, and a $0.02 loss on mark-to-market of publicly traded securities.\nFFO from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the Q3 compared to $2.83 in the prior period last year. So far, our real estate has produced $8.55 per share for the first nine months compared to $8.40 from last year. We are pleased with the transaction SPARC completed with Shein during the Q3 that demonstrated the value that we have created in that business. The transaction was significantly above our basis, and as a result, we recognize a gain in the quarter. The transaction ultimately reduced our ownership interest in SPARC from 50% to 33% as we admitted Shein as a partner. Given our lower ownership interest and the back-end weighting of profitability in the Q4, we now expect $0.05 lower FFO contribution from SPARC in the Q4 of this year.\nDuring the Q3, the Taubman family exercised their put right on a portion of their interest in TRG. We exchanged 1.725 million partnership interest units for an additional 4% ownership interest. We now own 84% of TRG. Domestic property NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year for the quarter and 3.8% for the first nine months. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.3% for the quarter and 4% for the first nine months of the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the Q3 was 95.2%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to last year. Our Q3 occupancy is higher than Q4 of last year, which has not occurred historically. The Mills occupancy was 97.4%, and occupancy is above all year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms.\nAverage base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 2.9% year-over-year, and The Mills was 3.6% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continues across our portfolio. We signed more than 970 leases for approximately 4.3 million sq ft in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2023, we signed more than 3,500 leases for 15 million sq ft, which is expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for another $400 million in revenue. We are seeing strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in Q3 was $744 for The Mills and outlets combined and $676 for mills. We continue to be active in redevelopment and new development.\nDuring the quarter, we started construction on a significant redevelopment at Brea Mall and a new upscale outlet center in Jakarta, our first premium outlet in Indonesia. We completed the refinancing of 11 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $960 million at an average rate of 6%. Our balance sheet is strong with approximately $8.8 billion of liquidity.\nToday, we announced a dividend of $1.90 per share for the Q4, which is a year-over-year increase of 5.6%. The dividend is payable on 29 December 2023. We also purchased approximately 1.27 million shares of our common stock for $140 million. We are increasing our full-year 2023 guidance from $11.85 to 11.95 to $12.15 to 12.25 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 at the midpoint. So, to conclude, I'm pleased with our Q3 results.\nOur business is performing well and is ahead of our plan. Tenant demand is strong. Occupancy is increasing. Base minimum rent levels are at record levels. We are very experienced at managing our business through volatile periods of time. As you all know, this is when we do some of our best work. We're now ready for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just one on some of the guideposts you've given in the past. As we're flipping the calendar to 2024, you talked about sort of 3% organic growth as achievable. Just wondering how you're thinking about that and how we should think about potential interest cost headwinds as that sort of rolls. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Look, I think we feel good about that kind of comparable NOI growth. Our debt is reasonably laddered. So, yes, we'll have some interest expense headwinds, but we still think we'll end up growing our business next year with that said.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator\n\nHoward.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd if I.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Go ahead, Ron.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nI was just going to say if I can ask a follow-up just on the $0.30 guidance raise. I think you talked about $0.32 gain and then $0.05 lower from the retailers. Just wondering, is there any other sort of puts and takes that we should be mindful of? Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. No, we're going to have $0.05 lower because of the SPARC-Shein deal. We lost a couple of cents from our mark-to-market on a couple of our public securities that we own last quarter. And essentially, the real estate business has been very significant to our growth. And we'll kind of see where the Q4 ends up, but I think it's we'll our 97% of our business is going to outperform what we thought from originally what we had budgeted.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good evening, everyone. David, I know you gave some numbers on recent leasing activity, which sounds really strong. I was wondering if you could give some additional context maybe to how that leasing activity compares to recent and pre-pandemic years, maybe what that means for pricing and how that could impact permanent occupancy?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, thank you, Caitlin. So I would say let me try and address your questions in no particular order. I think we'll be year-end occupancy will be obviously higher than it is today. I don't know that it'll be our highest ever, but it'll be within distance, pretty close.\nEven with all the volatility in the world and the market, we still expect we still see demand very strong. I mean, we're frankly, we're cautious. We're waiting for shoes to drop, but we haven't seen it on our new deals, whether it's F&B, entertainment, high-end luxury tenants, athleisure, just to name some categories. We're seeing we're still seeing a lot of demand on that front. And I would say from a pricing element, we feel I would say we feel comparable to the way we felt in the 2015, 2016, 2017 era in terms of era.\nI guess that was almost seven or eight years ago, but lots happened over those seven or eight years. We still feel like that's kind of where we're in that good shape where we're driving rents up, and it's okay for the retailers. They're making deals, and supply and demand's in our favor. Obviously, we cycled through a lot of poor-performing retailers due to COVID.\nThe ones that we are doing new deals with are excited to do business with us. Pricing's for sure going in the right direction. Occupancy's going up, and tenant demand is pretty strong across the whole spectrum. Even in certain categories, just to take luxury, yes, there's some that are being more cautious, but there's plenty that are growing new stores. It's really retail-specific. Obviously, bricks-and-mortar through the pandemic to today has proven its value to retailers.\nI'm sure you hear that on the conference calls from retailers. So in that sense, we're making a lot of good stuff happen. Brian, did you have something on the occupancy?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nI was just going to say we continue to see about 30% of our deals being new deals in the quarter. So that's consistent with the prior quarter as well. So there is definitely lots of activity on a new deal basis.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Sounds encouraging. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nSamir Khanal\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood evening, everyone. David, maybe provide color on how your malls are performing versus outlets, maybe from a regional standpoint, coastal, non-coastal, Sunbelt. Just trying to see if there's any differences from a leasing standpoint. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. It's interesting. I would say we're seeing pretty good tenant sales growth on the tourism properties, whether they're outlet or malls. Now, the most of our pure tourist properties are really the outlet centers, and we're seeing good growth in that category. Traffic generally is slightly above last year, still slightly below '19, but obviously, conversion's way up because our sales on a per-square-foot basis are much higher than '19. I would say, generally, whether mall or outlet, the Sunbelt area has produced pretty good results in terms of sales year-to-date. We saw actually a decent pickup in California, which was encouraging, but really good growth in the Woodbury Common that is finally getting the tourism back to where it is. And Peril's been strong in the outlet business.\nThere's no question people are looking for a little more value, or maybe they're looking for a lot more value given the higher inflation that the consumers had to deal with. Not a huge bifurcation between malls and outlets. It's very property-specific. As you know, we reported flat sales, basically quarter-over-quarter, and there's no real difference between outlets and malls in that number. Luxury, probably. Well, didn't probably.\nIt did flatten out in the Q3 of this year for sure, but it wasn't across the board. It was more a couple of specific retailers had a tough Q3. Others were up. So it was really retailer-specific. Jewelry, malls may have a little more exposure to jewelry. So that was a category that took a little more on the chin. Yet some of our higher-end retailers in the jewelry category performed well.\nSo it was basically not a real trend. I'd say the most important thing to come away with is that the Sunbelt continues to perform well, and we're seeing the tourist centers kind of make a nice comeback. They've been lagging a little bit more than the others over time and a little bit of flatlining in the luxury category. Tom.\n\nSamir Khanal\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nBrian, anything you want to add?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, I think you covered it, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, good evening. Good evening out there, David. So I'll do one question, and I'll hold the follow-up. As you guys gain leverage with the tenants, are you seeing tangible ability to get more favorable terms? One of the issues with retail over time has been the tenants, especially the larger tenants or the more anchor-ish or more fashionable, like the hot tenants of the day, are driving lease terms traditionally. Curious if you're seeing a change in that, which would translate to an ability to accelerate rent growth, NOI growth, etc.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, we don't have. I mean, thank you for the question, Alex. We're not that far away. You always say out here. We're really not that far away. But put that aside. It's not a question of leverage over the retailers. I think what we have going for us is a great, diverse portfolio.\nIt's the best in the industry from Mills to our outlets to our full-price malls. And that's unique. It's size, it's scale, it's quality that we've built up over many, many years. And as you remember, I don't think it was last quarter. Maybe it was, Tom, but when we went through the transformation of the portfolio, it was the last quarter. So we've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the portfolio. And I would say that, obviously, there's not a lot of new retail being built.\nThere's not a lot of retailers closing stores or going bankrupt. I think most retailers today know kind of the good malls and the good properties versus the not-so-good. When you add that up, supply and demand is in our favor, and we're generating market rents. It's neither here nor there. Importantly, I think I'd like to address this with you, is that, and again, I'm sure retailers have a different point of view, but I think the most interesting fact or the most interesting thing that we have going for us, in addition to the quality, diversity, etc., that I mentioned, they know we're going to be around. They know that we'll stick to a deal. We'll make it happen. When we say we're going to redevelop something, we do it.\nAnd I think that when there are open-to-buys, we tend to get our fair share of those or more than because of some of the factors that I mentioned: quality, scale, but also the fact that they know we're going to get the job done. And obviously, there's been a lot of changes in mall ownership over the years. Balance sheet and quality of operations is a two-way street. It's both. As we look at retailers, we assess that. They certainly assess us. And I think that gives us an advantage that we've worked very hard, as you know, to achieve. And I mean, how do I say this? I mean, we've really outpaced our peer group dramatically. Dramatically. In any measure you want: growth, earnings, dividend, quality of operations, scale, balance sheet.\nI know we all focus quarter-to-quarter and this and that, but if you take a step back and you go, \"What do you got going for you?\" And again, this sounds a little braggadocious. I don't want it to, but I mean, we've really outpaced. If you look over the last 10, five, 10, 15, 20, 25 years, we've dramatically outpaced our peer group.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you. No follow-up. I stumped you. I love it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nJeffrey Spector\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good afternoon. David, just want to tie in some of the leasing comments, the momentum you're seeing, the deals in the pipeline, the high occupancy levels to the redevelopment pipeline. Just, I guess, how are you thinking about that pipeline and the ability to increase that? How are you going to satisfy some of the needs out there and continue to capture that market share, maybe even more?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Jeff. So look, I think we have the ability to develop and redevelop because we're not, essentially, what I said earlier. We're not, \"Listen, we've got to be stewards of capital. We've got to be very focused.\" But we're not capital-constrained the way some others might be. And our ability to invest in our portfolio is unmatched. So we intend to do that. Now, at the same time, Jeff, rates are up. Returns for us have to be up. And so you haven't seen a really big change in our 8-K redevelopment, but that takes time because a lot of the stuff was put in place.\nBut when we build something new or we redevelop, we're going to have to do a better job of leasing and returns and to warrant that capital because just about everything we do, I mean, we still want to maintain our leadership position, but just about every amount of capital we spend, I have to measure it in my own mind against buying our stock back. And I mean, our stock, as you saw, we bought stock back.\nSo our stock is pretty compelling. So we want to redevelop. We want to new develop, but we've got a high hurdle that we've got to jump over. So like we've done historically, I expect us to find the right balance between continuing and to maintain our leadership position, investing in our properties for the benefit of shareholders, communities, and retailers alike. But at the same time, we've got to be economic animals.\nThat's what everybody here understands, that process, and that's what we try and achieve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, you specifically mentioned the performance of the real estate business on this call several times, which has been strong. At the same time, this quarter, you sold off some of SPARC. So how can you continue to refine some of the ancillary parts of the business so that the strength that we're seeing and that you're talking about on the core business can continue to shine through?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, listen, it's a very good question, and it's less and less of our business. As you know, it's under 5% of our earnings. You also have to understand that when we add it to our FFO, it's net income, which in many of these cases, you don't add, well, all of these cases, you don't add back depreciation. So EBITDA and our FFO contribution are much different. Importantly, these have all been profitable endeavors. But we understand that even the small amount of earnings that we get in comparison to our total earnings power is volatile. People don't like the volatility. Like we did with SPARC earlier, we're going to continue to harvest our investments over time.\nAs we do that, we're going to—if you ask me today, we'll monetize things over time, and we're going to buy our stock back because it's wildly accretive because let's look at it. You know what I trade at as a multiple of FFO? And I have investment value in these investments, but they give us very little earnings because of GAAP. And if you do the math, you could see the accretion we would get on a buyback.\nSo they're basically—I get no earnings from them, but I've got value. And it's our job to get the value into cash, take the cash, buy our stock back, or invest in properties and have it a bygone era of the time. But with an asterisk that said, \"Attaboy, you made a lot of money.\" So that's the strategy. I hope that answered your question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed.\n\nFloris Van Dijkum\n\nResearch Analyst, Compass Point\n\nHey, David. Thanks for taking my question. So I was curious on TRG. So I noticed the occupancy dipped a little bit. Essentially, you want to increase your ownership by 4% by issuing some OPUs. What price was the stock issued at, and what yield are you buying? What's the implied cap rate on the TRG business? And how should we think about that also as it relates to other potential opportunities in the market? And how much flexibility was there? And then maybe, I guess, in terms of the timing of the next sort of puts or hurdles that you have for increasing your interest in that business going forward.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Let me. I'll just talk about the exchange a little bit, and then Brian can give you an idea. The occupancy is no big deal, but I'll let Brian go through that. So Taubman has the right to put their interest, their 4% interest for the next five years. And it's basically at essentially appraised value. It's either a negotiation or we get appraisal firms. And we decided to negotiate in good faith.\nWe made a deal, and then we issued the stock. And I mean, the reality is we're trading. Simon Property Group unequivocally is trading below appraised value. So one of the reasons we bought our stock back was I'm not a big fan of issuing stock at this moment in time. So we'll use our capital to basically get rid of the dilution that we did issue. Now, Taubman had that right. They exercised it appropriately.\nWe had a good faith negotiation, made a deal, and it was more or less at their appraised value. To put it in perspective for us, today's value, it's probably pretty close to where we negotiated our deal with Taubman pre-COVID. Then, obviously, we got the COVID adjustment, but it was in that range kind of where the deal was announced publicly. So we're going to quarterize that dilution by buying our stock back. We started that once we made the deal. I think the family's pretty smart. They said, \"Simon Property Group stock's undervalued, and I like the dividend, and why not?\" So I think at the, I don't know what'll happen next year. It could be the same thing, but at this point, they have 16% left in TRG. We're happy to own 100% of TRG.\nI think they're happy to do what they're doing, and we'll deal with it as time goes on. But nothing can happen the rest of this year, and it's sometime next year that this all recycles. So with that said, I hope that answers that, but Brian, if you want to add anything to that, please.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNothing on that. Floris, on your question about their occupancy, it is back 110 basis points. There were really two major spaces that they had to take out of commission that come back online in Q4. So you will see that come back on and then some in Q4. It's just simply timing.\n\nFloris Van Dijkum\n\nResearch Analyst, Compass Point\n\nGot it. If I may, if you don't mind, if I recall correctly, I have to look at my notes, but the cap rate at the time that you did the deal was it had a six handle on it. Is that the right way to think about the appraised value for TRG?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, again, this was a negotiated deal. Their view of appraised value started much higher than that, with all due respect for us, which you might imagine. But we settled on a deal that today, if you go back in time to Taubman pre-COVID, would have attributed Taubman's per-share number in the $51 range. So somewhere in that range, we ended up, if you remember, doing COVID at $43 a share. I will tell you that their NOI today is higher than it was in 2019. Portfolios change here and there.\nSo it's really hard to do apples-to-apples, but at the end of the day, that gives you the sense of things. But you're not that far off. I think that's a reasonable estimate. But that kind of puts all the metrics out there. And again, not a huge deal in the scheme of things, under a couple hundred million today. But it gives you a perspective of kind of that. I think they would argue the appraised value is much higher than what they exchanged at, but we ultimately did not go through the appraisal process.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nHi, good afternoon. The minimum base rents were about 3% year-over-year, which is about the same level as contractual bumps. So I'm just trying to get a sense of leasing spread economics here. Does that mean leasing spreads are also in the low-single-digit range, or are there other factors influencing this metric one way or another?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I mean, let's see if Brian will add to it. Just remember, this is the total portfolio. So to move this thing up takes a lot, right? And spreads are just a moment leases that come in and go out. So you can't really look at it that way. So for us to move the entire portfolio gives you a sense of leasing spreads. Now, if you look at what page is on the 8-K, the.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nBMR page.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWe added some new information there on the.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\n21.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHuh? 29.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\n21.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYou'll see some of that.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThe new rates.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSome of these that are going in there now are driving the rent. The rent, those numbers now include our new leases that are driving that base minimum rent up.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYes. I mean, we typically only touch about 10% of our leases a year, Vin. So you got to factor that in as well. So renewals are about 10%, but the balance is our new leases, which, as David said, are really driving the higher or contributing to the higher average base minimum rents.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nWas my statement fair, though, that contractual bumps for base rent are still around 3%, or are they lower than that, the overall portfolio?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, they're right in that range, Vince.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nAnd then, just, is there any color you can share about renewal spreads? I know it's hard to move the overall portfolio with 10%, but this kind of conversation means they're not too far away from the average contractual bumps. Because if they were plus 30%, to take an extreme example, we could see that in the metrics. So I'm just trying to ultimately get some more color here on renewal economics.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I mean, I guess, again, Vince, in order to have the average base minimum rent go up for 20,000 leases, okay, of 3% versus 10% to 15% that calculate spread, you're going to be mathematically going to have rent spreads that are higher than the 3%. And we'll walk you through that later. But just from a math point of view, there's just no way that that can drive that number up. But we'll walk you through that. So when you say that, we would say to you, that's not reality because in order to drive up average base minimum rent for 20,000 leases or thereabouts, you're going to have to outperform much more than the 3% on just what's rolling over.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nManaging Director, Green Street\n\nNo question.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNo. So we can take it offline. I appreciate the time.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nDirector, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good evening, David and Brian. I'll keep this to one and a half questions for you. So last quarter, you spoke about potentially being more active with asset recycling or reallocating real estate capital. Have the challenges facing the financing market changed those expectations at all? Or how are you thinking about that today? And how are higher interest rates impacting your customers and tenants?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I'll take the last first. So I would say higher interest rates and inflation clearly is affecting a good portion of the consumer out there. So their affordability for, and we're seeing this most on the consumer on what I'd call the kind of the more, the brands that are focused on the more moderate-income consumer. So there's no question that that's having some impact.\nBut the good news is you got employment and you got wage growth that is counterbalancing that, but they're definitely being more cautious. So that's not necessarily affecting a higher-income consumer to the extent that you might otherwise think, but it's clearly affecting the lower or more moderate-income consumer that they're being more cautious. And from our standpoint, from a retail point of view, demand, like I said earlier, we haven't seen it affecting retailers too much in terms of their growth plans.\nBut we obviously monitor that every day. So from our standpoint, our cost of capital is up. So any investment we make, as I mentioned earlier, is measured against the return we would get from buying our stock back, the return that we would get from redevelopment or development. And given that, that's why we haven't been active on the acquisition front. And I don't expect that to really change. In addition, we're always looking at monetizing our assets, whether it's real estate or otherwise. And to the extent that we can make the math work and we create liquidity through asset sales, the math is very compelling for us to do that to buy our stock back. And so you'll see more of that trend continue.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nDirector, Scotiabank\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Hi. Just a quick one here. And I know this is a bit of a hypothetical, but do you think you would have bought stock back if you didn't issue the shares to Taubman?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI think we would buy. I'm sorry. I think we're looking. It's a good question, a fair question. And let me say this the way I'm thinking about it. So to the extent that we have additional liquidity events or, in the case of Taubman, dealing with the dilution of issuing stock at this price, there's no question we're going to buy our stock back. To the extent that we don't.\nI don't have an answer for you yet on whether we would have done it absent the TRG issuance or an enhanced liquidity from asset sales. But like I said, our development pipeline, redevelopment pipeline is very much, very much measured up against the stock buyback. And every asset I've got, I don't have to own anything at this point. I'm happy to sell assets at the right price to buy our stock back.\nI think you'll see more of that from us over time. That could be real estate and/or other stuff.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Okay. And real quick, and just in case I missed this, was there any change to the OPU guidance that's embedded in your current FFO outlook?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYes. We've lowered it. We've lowered it. Other than that, you understand the $0.05 because we own less of SPARC. We have lowered it for the Q4 by roughly, guys.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nFor Q4, it'd be about $0.20.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Yeah. Roughly $0.20 in Q4.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nLower contribution.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nLower contribution. If you look in total for the year and our share of that is roughly, if you take out the $0.05, we've lowered it about $0.15.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed.\n\nNick Joseph\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks. It's actually Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, you've talked a lot on the share buybacks. It sounds like in your answer to the last question, we're open to asset sales and other monetization opportunities. What are you seeing in the transaction market today in terms of those asset sales? Where are cap rates? What's the buyer pool like? Are you seeing an opportunity to try to crystallize some of that disconnect between the stock price and where you would hope to sell an asset?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, look, I think domestic retail is not a lot of transactions, but we have assets throughout the world. That's one. Two is obviously we've got investments in our OPU category. But frankly, domestic assets, other than maybe some of our residential stuff, hotel stuff, there's just not a lot happening. And we might see some stuff, but I think that won't be really driving kind of the activity that we would anticipate.\n\nNick Joseph\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSenior Vice President, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. About 6% of ABR is on month-to-month leasing and then 12% expiring for 2024. How much of the month-to-month is getting converted to permanent, or should that number grow? And then in terms of the 12% expiring in 2024, what's been addressed from a renewal standpoint from where you stand today?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. I know that there's a number of leases in 2023 that are basically agreed to. We're just finalizing the documentation. So that's the first. And I would think that generally, we're more than halfway through 2024 right now on a kind of a negotiated, not papered basis. So Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to it, but that would be, that's kind of where we are generically.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. And Linda, you can see the material change Q2 over to Q3. We've cleared about 2.2 million sq ft out of that category. It's just a matter of processing. We talked about it on our last call. There's just a lag effect in the processing of those leases. So we do expect that to continue.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nSenior Vice President, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed.\n\nHaendel Juste\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey. Good evening out there. Dave, I just had a quick follow-up on the consumer retail sales line of questioning from earlier. I think you know that your portfolio sales were flat during the quarter. We've heard from other sectors, storage, apartments, which seemed like the consumer hit a bit of a wall during the Q3 in September. I'm curious if you saw anything within the quarter, maybe in September of that sort. And then perhaps what's your expectations in the near-term outlook for retail sales for your portfolio and the consumer as we head into the holiday season next year? Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Well, generally, as we said earlier in the year, we expect to be more or less flat. So that's kind of what our expectations continue to be in terms of reported retailer sales. Again, we feel pretty good about the higher-income consumer. We've also got a balancing act in terms of some of our value-oriented centers will maybe play a more important role for our consumer today that they might not have otherwise played last couple of years. But it's unknown. I mean, we're being extra cautious because of the inflation is still a little bit there, still taking a bite out of the consumer. And obviously, you've got rates that are beginning to filter through the economic system. So cautious, flat. We're not anticipating a downturn, but not a robust sales growth for the Q4. Relatively flat.\n\nHaendel Juste\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGot it. Appreciate that. If I could squeeze in a follow-up. I think you mentioned earlier as well that you started, I think it was $960 million of new redevelopment at 6% yields. And you talked about a higher hurdle rate, maybe some color on perhaps what that hurdle rate today is and where the next batch of redevelopment yields or projects would need to be and where we could see them migrate to. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Yeah. I think it's a little bit dependent upon the real estate and what we're trying to accomplish, and what the benefits of that real estate are, and where the market is for that. So for instance, when we build a new residential apartment house, we look at kind of where the value and the cap rates for that are. They may be obviously lower than our own, but to the extent that we feel like we might sell it and make the arbitrage, we'll do that. Again, if we've got an asset that's a 6% cap rate and we're building to an 8%, that's creating value. On the other hand, if we have an 8% asset that we're building to a 6%, it ain't going to happen.\nSo, we have themes, we have points of view, but just like anything else, every transaction we do, every redevelopment we do really is grounded by what we're trying to accomplish with that real estate. But overall, again, like I said earlier, we've got to push it higher because our cost of capital, regardless, is up across the board. So we don't have the luxury to build dilutive deals. And as you know, we've never really bought dilutive. We've never really built dilutive. And we certainly don't anticipate doing that today. We've always had a spread to our financing and to the quality of what we've built. We expect that to continue, but obviously, those thresholds have been raised.\n\nHaendel Juste\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nDave, and the best for last. I love it. Thanks for the time. Just curious if you could comment on kind of the watch list you've commented about the consumer, but maybe what the bad debt has been year-to-date with the historical levels is in your perspective as you think about 2024.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThe watch list on retailers?\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. It's relatively low. There are a couple that were there today that probably weren't there last year. Obviously, I'm not going to name those. So it certainly hasn't grown all that much, but there are one or two retailers that we're paying close attention to. And I probably wouldn't have said that last year. So I think that, I mean, it's not a very good answer, but it's probably the best way to explain it without naming names. But there are a couple on that list today that didn't exist yesterday, but they're not 10 names. There are a couple. Brian, you want to add anything?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, I think that's right, David. It has certainly expanded, but by only two or three names. And it's at a relatively low point relative to history.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. And I want to just confirm with everyone that that is, as you look at our, what page is our top tenant list on?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nEVP and CFO, Simon Property Group\n\nIt's on 22.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nIt's certainly none of the category that is in our top 10 or top 20. As you know, our department stores don't pay, really don't pay all that much. Well, you have the rent there in terms of what they pay.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Simon for closing comments.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, thank you. We finished a little bit earlier, so I think enjoy the rest of the evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nGood evening. Thanks, Tom. Before turning to the results, I would like to provide some perspective on our company as we celebrated our 30th anniversary as a public company mid-December of last year. We have grown our company into a global leader of premier shopping, dining, entertainment, and mixed-use destinations, managing through, and in some cases, very turbulent times. Over the last three decades, from our base of 115 properties in 1993, we have acquired approximately 300 properties, developed more than 50, and disposed of approximately 250, resulting in our current domestic portfolio of about 215 assets. We expanded globally and today have 35 international outlets, including world-renowned outlets in Asia. Our portfolio is differentiated by product type, geography, enclosed and open-air centers located in large and dense catchment areas. Our portfolio is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet and a top management team.\nWe are the largest landlord to the world's most important retailers, and not by accident. Our diversified tenant base has solid credit, and our mix is always changing and adapting, best illustrated by the fact that compared to 30 years ago, only one retailer is still in our current top 10 tenants. Our team's hard work has resulted in industry-leading results, including some of the following. Our annual revenue increased from $424 million to nearly $5.7 billion. Our annual FFO generation increased 30x from approximately $150 million to nearly $4.7 billion, a 12% CAGR. Total Market Capitalization has increased from $3 billion to $90 billion. We have paid over $42 billion in dividends to shareholders. We have assets in our portfolio that have been in business for more than 60 years. Those assets are still growing today, with many generating $100 million in NOI.\nThese assets are in great locations, have a loyal and large customer base, and are where the retailers want to be. No other asset type has the longevity, including the NOI generation and embedded future growth that these assets have. Yes, they change. Yes, they evolve. Yes, they adapt. But yes, they also grow. Our collection of assets cannot be replicated, and there are always hidden opportunities within them. I want to thank the entire Simon team who have contributed to 30 years of success as a public company. And now let me turn to our Q4, 2023 results. We generated approximately $4.7 billion in funds from operations in 2023, or $12.51 per share, and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, FFO was $1.38 billion, or $3.69 per share, compared to $1.27 billion, or $3.40 per share.\nLet me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2022. Domestic operations had a terrific performance this quarter and contributed $0.28 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income with lower operating expenses. Gains from investment activity in the Q4 were approximately $0.07 higher in a year-over-year comparison. Other platform investments had $0.03 lower contribution compared to last year. FFO from our Real Estate Business was $3.23 per share in the Q4, compared to $2.97 from last year. That's 8.7% growth and $11.78 per share for 2023, compared to $11.39 last year. Domestic Property NOI increased 7.3% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. Continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending, operational excellence delivered results for the year exceeding our initial expectations. Our NOI ended the year higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\nPortfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, grew 7.2% in constant currency for the quarter and 4.9% for Malls and Outlets occupancy at the end of Q4 was 95.8%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. The Mills occupancy was 97.8%. Occupancy is above year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum Malls and Outlets increased 3.1% year-over-year, and the Mills rent increased 4.3%. We signed more than 960 leases for approximately 3.4 million sq ft in Q4. For the year, we signed over 4,500 leases, representing more than 18 million sq ft. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals with going-in rents of approximately $74 per sq ft, and renewals had going-in rents of approximately $65 per sq ft. Leasing momentum for the last couple of years continues into 2024.\nReported retailer sales per square foot in the quarter was Malls and Outlets combined and $677 for The Mills. During the quarter, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG for gross proceeds of $300 million in cash and reported pre-tax and after-tax gains of $157 million and $118 million, respectively. We opened our 11th outlet in Europe last year. Construction continues on two outlets, yes, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and yes, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. We completed 13 significant redevelopments and will complete other major development projects this year. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on five to six mixed-use projects, representing around $800 million of spend from Orange County to Ann Arbor to Boston to Seattle to Roosevelt Field. There's some of the ones that are planning to start this year.\nWe expect to fund these redevelopments and mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after dividend payments. During 2023, we completed $12 billion in financing activities, including three senior note offerings for approximately $3.1 billion, including the Klépierre Exchangeable Offering. We recast and upsized our primary revolver credit facility to $5 billion and completed $4 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. We have approximately $11 billion of liquidity. During 2023, we paid, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 billion in common stock dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $110 per share in 2023. And today, we announced our dividend of $1.95 per share for the Q1, a year-over-year increase of 8.3%. The dividend is payable on 29 March 2024.\nNow, moving on to 2024, our FFO guidance is $11.85 to $12.10 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: Domestic Property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2023 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share, reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions and cash balances, contribution from other platform investments of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share, no significant acquisition or disposition activity, and our current diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. So with that said, it's safe to say we're excited to enter year 2031 as a public company. Thank you for your time, and we're ready for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Our first question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Sakwa\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. Good evening, David. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about kind of the leasing pipeline and where things stand today versus maybe the year ago, and what sort of conversations are you having with the tenants, and maybe how has the pricing dynamic changed, given that you're now kind of 95% leased and pretty full in the portfolio?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I mean, Steve, we're always adjusting our mix. We're always trying to—so even though we're 96% leased thereabouts, we're always looking to improve our retailer mix. And obviously, that's been beneficial to our NOI growth. I would say just generically, and obviously, I spent a lot of time myself on leasing and with my team on leasing. Demand remains very strong. And there is a real interest by all sorts of retailers and people that populate our shopping centers to be part of what we're doing. So I think, as you probably saw, our new deals are $74 a foot thereabouts. Our renewals are $65 a foot. Our expiring leases this year are in the $56 to $57 range. So we're seeing generally positive spreads. Supply and demand is in our favor. Historically low supply in big properties across the country.\nI mean, there used to be 40 million sq ft of retail real estate built every year. Now there's essentially less than a few million sq ft here and there. And then there's been obsolescence too, which makes the supply shrink as well. And then there's just great new retailers that we're very excited to do business with. I was on the West Coast seeing some of them. The importance of bricks and mortar has never been higher. And the cost of all of the things that we said about, don't get me wrong, e-commerce is critically important, but all of the stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, stickiness, etc., all continues to be a challenge. If you've looked at the marketplaces, that pure online, they've run into problems. So they really need to be connected to a bricks and mortar for survivability.\nSo all of those things are pointing to a positive picture. It's a function of execution, a function of being first, a function of continuing to improve our properties, which we're very focused about. But even though we've bounced back and had a couple of really good years in terms of lease-up from the depths of the pandemic, we're not finished, and retail demand continues and it's strong. And it's across the board. I mean, it is not one category, one retailer, but pretty much across the board.\n\nSteve Sakwa\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. That's it.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good evening, everyone. David, could you give some more detail on the ABG sale that you referenced, maybe how much you still own, how much you think your remaining OPI could be worth, and whether you plan to monetize more in 2024, or maybe what could influence that decision?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Well, let me just. We sold about 2% of our ABG stock. So we essentially went from just under 12 to just under 10. And we'll continue to look to monetize these investments. They've been, by and large, very good investments across not just the big ones, but the smaller ones as well. Obviously, there's a number of them that are synergistic to us. But we have a strict adherence to creating value. And if we think we can deploy that capital into kind of what I'd call the mothership and get better growth from that, then that's where our number one priority will be. So it wouldn't surprise me, Caitlin, for us to continue to monetize. Obviously, some of these are bigger investments, so it's not easy to do it in one big swoop. But we're very focused on portfolio management of those assets.\nIf we can monetize them, are we going to get a better return allowing it back into our core business?\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nCool. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Spector\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. And first, congratulations on the anniversary. David, there's a lot of initiatives. So as you think about the next five years, I know it's probably a difficult question, but is there one or two key initiatives that you're most excited about as you think about the next five years?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, look, I'd say a couple of things. On the property level, there's no question that all of the mixed-use stuff that we're bringing in, plus the redevelopment of our department store boxes, are probably the most interesting and exciting things that we're doing on the ground level. And so that would certainly be number one. Number two is we're very excited about growing our outlet business in Southeast Asia. It's an incredibly robust market, young population, and a growing—and when I say Southeast Asia, I'm not like in Jakarta, places like that where it's not China. It's places like that where we see kind of what we can do in Japan and in Korea on the outlet side. Jeff, you probably know that better than anybody based on your previous history in terms of that. So that's very exciting.\nI'd also say we still are in the pursuit of bringing technology to our loyal consumers that allow them to enhance their shopping experience with us. So we've got a lot of initiatives on the marketing, loyalty. Simon Search is a great example where our consumer, either in property or pre-visit, can search our tenant base for, if they're looking for a black dress, where in the center can I buy it, at what retailer. Obviously, that ties into the marketplace we're building with Premium Outlets. There'll be some news there this year on that front. So that whole ecosystem, that whole system about customer interaction, reinforcing their shopping behavior, rewarding loyalty, expediting their trip, and making it more useful is a big focus.\nAnd then as important, I think this is number four, really, is just we've got to do a great job of continuing to evolve our retailer mix. The exciting thing is there are more and more entrepreneurs. There are more and more exciting retailers that are coming up with great concepts, proving them out, and then realizing that our centers are a good place for them to do business. So those are the ones that come to mind, but I'm certain there'll be ones that I haven't even thought of.\n\nJeff Spector\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you, Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey. Good evening. Good evening out there, David. So I think at the opening, you mentioned that NOI is now exceeding pre-pandemic. The dividend is within less than 10% of pre-pandemic. And sort of thinking about Jeff's and Steve's questions on reinvestment, as you think about getting back to that pre-pandemic dividend level, given the investment opportunities, especially lack of supply, growing demand, people are once again really engaged in physical retail, does that change your trajectory as you think about getting the dividend back to pre-pandemic? Meaning, are there better investment opportunities with that capital, or is the delta really a function of rising interest rates? That's meaning that the surpassing pre-pandemic NOI versus the dividend is really just a function of the higher interest expense now.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I mean, Alex, look, our yield is ridiculously hot. Okay? So that's really—I mean, we could financially pay $2.10 tomorrow. Right? So we have $1.5 billion of free cash flow after our dividend. So it has nothing to do with financial wherewithal. I mean, we would like our—we would like—we don't like trading at this higher yield. So I think that's kind of how we look at it. We still think, as we have these additional capital events, we still are anxious to continue to buy our stock back. And again, when I look at either the S&P 500, I look at the REIT Peer Group, I look at what the strip center REITs, our yield is plenty high for investors.\nSo tell all of my investors, \"I could pay $2.10 tomorrow evening, okay, per quarter without a blink.\" But our yield is too high, and it'll be there before you know it, but we would like to trade at a lower yield because we think certainly, if you look at it on that basis, our yield is higher than it should be. I mean, the S&P is under 2%. Our REIT strip centers, Tom, are in the fours. We're close to 7%, right? 6.5%, 7. So I mean, Alex, you should be pounding the table.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYes. Unfortunately, I'm a non-paying customer. The real customers are the ones listening to the call. We're just asking the questions.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNo, I'm kidding. No. By the way, we are, just so you know, we like your welcome out there. We are west of the Hudson, but we're not going to tell you exactly where we are. Okay?\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nSomewhere in.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWe may not be in Indiana tonight. We may not be in Indiana tonight, but we are west of the Hudson.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nI assume you'll be in Las Vegas this Sunday.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I can't tell you my schedule.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, base minimum rents are up healthily in the low single-digit range year-over-year, while your tenant sales per square foot are down slightly. So can you just talk a little bit about these dynamics? Is that a reflection of your rents kind of catching up to some of the strength that the tenants have experienced before their sales have started to come down? And just how long are these dynamics kind of sustainable like this? Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Good question. So I will say this. I think the rent, the going-in rents, renewals, or new leases are very much sustainable. If you look at our occupancy costs, they're still at the low end of our historical range. We're at 12.6, and we have run up to 14%+ before. And I would also caution, these are the sales that our tenants are reporting to us, but they are somewhat affected by returns they get and so on. We actually think our sales per foot are higher than this. In some cases, they have the ability to offset returns. In most cases, they don't. So I just put that out there. So I wouldn't, and I mentioned this maybe two, three years ago, probably certainly pre-pandemic, but we report it. I know the market likes it. We actually think our sales are higher.\nThey come from our properties, and then they're somewhat affected by returns. And we think a lot of those returns are internet sales returns, so they don't even come from our properties. And so again, when we look at it, we feel like supply and demand, low occupancy cost, high retail sales, and just overall demand will be able to generate kind of the new leasing and renewal spreads that we've seen over the last couple of years.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris, is your line on mute?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nFloris. Looks like we lost Floris. Why don't we go on? Our next question. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, guys. Sorry. Just going back to maybe the reinvestment theme here. You guys have plenty of cash after the dividend. And I'm just kind of curious at this point, what is the level of anchor box reinvestment you guys think you need to do, just given what maybe they did today? And after you guys were spared kind of some of the recent Macy's closings, but just as you look at the portfolio today, kind of what do you think over the next two, three years you guys could ultimately get back and have to retain? And just you talked a lot about how the leasing environment is good. Just what's the outlook for retaining those boxes today? What's the targeted kind of makeup there? And is luxury still doing enough to be able to be the primary kind of backfill option?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, Craig, on the department store boxes, I don't have it off the top of my head, but the ones we own, we basically don't have a ton of work to do. We have a handful of boxes that we own that are in process. For instance, I mentioned Brea just briefly on the call. That was a former Sears store. We tore it down. It's in development now, under construction now. So the actual stores that we own are not many, probably under 10 at this point, that are either currently under construction or in process. So very small amount of kind of less of an opportunity than you think. The ones that Taubman still own some boxes, and so does Seritage. So we'll see how that evolves.\nI mean, eventually, some of those could be opportunities for us to buy and redevelop. We haven't made deals on those just because bid and ask has been too great. But we find, and I don't think luxury is really going to be the dominant thing on a lot of these mixed use, or I'm sorry, on these boxes. I think a lot of it will continue to be the mixed use development that we're doing. And obviously, opening up, if it's an enclosed mall, opening the center up with restaurants, entertainment, and so on has worked very well. So we have a number under construction or about to be under construction, but we don't really have that existing pipe until we make more deals to buy some of the boxes back. It's not as big as you might think, and it's only a handful.\nNow, Macy's, as you're right, they announced some store closings, none of which are ours. So we're always very focused on knowing exactly where we might be at risk. And I would point out, very importantly, when Sears went out of business, the whole market said, \"How are you going to survive Sears going out of business?\" They had 800 department stores at that time. I think, frankly, they're down to, believe it or not, operating maybe five, six, seven, eight. I think we actually have the most between us and the Taubman portfolio. But how are you going to survive it? The fact of the matter is it was a non-event to the mall customer. And if anything, as we've gotten those boxes back, we've made the center better. So as we look, we don't look at box the changes in box as a concern.\nWe view it really more aggressively and progressively as something that will enhance the property's portfolio. And the assets that we were worried about that couldn't survive that basically don't exist in our portfolio anymore. So if you asked me that question 10 years ago, I might have a different answer.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nCraig, I hope you get better prior to the Citi conference. I'm sure you will, but it sounds like you lost your voice.\n\nCraig Mailman\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah. Hopefully, I'll be on the mend by then. Thanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAll right. Be well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nHi. Good evening. Could you help me better understand how much incremental FFO we should expect in 2024 from development or redevelopment projects that stabilize either later in 2023 or are slated to be finished in 2024? Any color to help us better understand the timing of incremental NOI and FFO from all the development activities would be helpful?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. In fact, it's interesting. You actually take us—I think in 2024, we're taking a step back. I'll just give you a trivial example. I mentioned Brea now for the third time, but we have a whole wing that's connected to the former Sears department store that we're redeveloping. We'll have some outdoor shops. We're building a Dick's Sporting Goods. We have a Life Time, and then we'll do roughly 350 apartments or so. But that wing leading to Sears, we've had to de-lease it to ultimately put in—I'm sure I'm allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyway—Zara and Uniqlo. And they won't open until end of 2024, best case. So that's, by and large, all of the stuff in the 8-K that we've listed. And I don't believe Brea is in there if it is. It'll be in there shortly.\nNone of that really gets in 2024. We do have Tulsa opening in late summer. That'll have a marginal impact. Leasing there is going well. But with all the redeveloping, this is really more of a 2025, 2026 story. And the one that we'll see the benefit of this year, and I don't have a number handy, is Phipps, which we opened in 2023. That's kind of the one that I would say most meaningful of it. But most of the redevelopment is a 2025, 2026 story.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nNo, that's really helpful. I mean, is there any—for just in terms of, I guess, the $1.3 billion that's active today plus the $800 million you're going to start? I mean, what's a fair assumption for 2025, 2026 in terms of level of maybe spend stabilizing? I mean, that's at least how we model it. Is $500 million stabilizing annually at, let's call it a 7% to 8% yield, a fair assumption? And that's something I'm trying to get at. How quickly does this come up?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. No, I appreciate that. If you don't include what I saw, ground-up new development, I would say probably about between $600 million and $800 million a year. And our goal would hopefully be to bring that in at north of 8%. Obviously, if it is multifamily, you can still create value at a lower yield than that. And in some cases, we're building at a lower yield than that. For instance, both Brea's Apartments and the ones that we're building at the former Northgate Mall, we're basically about to start construction there. We'll be sub 8%, so it may round down that 8%. But if you're talking kind of everything else, we would hope to be north of that.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nThank you. That's all really helpful color. Appreciate it.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRon Kamdem\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Just a two-parter really quickly, starting with the core NOI. Just in 2024, can you just touch on the tourist centers and how much recovery there is and how much upside it's providing to 2024, as well as the variable to fix conversion? Just trying to get a sense of how much of a tailwind that is to the core. And then on the sort of other platform investment, maybe could you just touch on what seasonality should we be thinking about between sort of the first part of the year and Q4? Thanks so much.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. And Brian will chime in here. I'll just give you some thoughts off the top of my head, and then Brian, hopefully, will agree or correct me. So I would say we saw in 2023 a really decent bounce back from the tourist centers. Now, I give you a great example. And I was just having to look at this—I must have been probably doing my job, but I noticed in Q4, Q4, as an example of the bounce back, Woodbury Q4 sales were around $350 million, okay? Which to me is a real good indicator of bounce back. And obviously, the highest four-quarter sales we've had there in quite some time. So I'd say generally, we're seeing a really good bounce back in the tourist centers. I don't think we're going to—the one area that the US overall and obviously will have an impact on us.\nI do not think we'll see the Chinese. We do not expect the Chinese to come back the way they had before the pandemic. And just our tourist centers did outpace our sales for the portfolio for 2023 on average. So good bounce back across the board. And then I would say on your variable rent, we continue to see that as a lower percent of revenues, both the vast majority. I think we increased our, the way to think about it that's interesting is, and again, hopefully, Brian won't need to correct me, but Brian's available to correct me, our domestic operations had $0.28 of improvement QoQ. That's $0.28. And within that $0.28, our variable income went down. So I think that gives you kind of a leading barometer. We're still working that way down, and we're getting that into kind of our base rent.\nAnd then your final on OPI: lost Q1, relatively flat Q2, Q3, and then most of it in Q4. Q2 is a little better than Q3 usually, but on the margins. We're only projecting this year $0.10 to 0.15. All right. How'd I do?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYou got it.\n\nRon Kamdem\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Thanks, Ron.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good evening, David. I just want to dig into the guidance a bit and that OPI that you just cited in particular. Is it fair to assume that the $0.10 to 0.15 includes gains or monetization similar to last year, or are operations expected to improve from the -$0.02 contribution to FFO in 2023?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Thank you for that question. The answer, no, that's pure operations. No one-time or sale gains, or any of that are in there. Yeah, I mean, we had a tough 2023 in OPI. We saw that we didn't meet both our budgeted expectations and our expectations kind of mid-year when we recalibrated it. The team and OPI, again, we're partners with, so it's not just us. We're partners are making significant efforts within their own business to improve performance. Again, the overriding thing was, and we should be sensitive to this across the board, the overriding theme was the lower-income consumer still with inflation and embedded, even though inflation has subsided, they're still dealing with things that cost a lot more money than they used to.\nThe good news is their income is increasing, but it's still not in a position that they have the discretionary income that they need and they deserve. We need to figure that out as a country.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nJust to clarify.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSo, no. Yeah. So, hopefully I answered. So, no one-time gains. Hopefully, we're being conservative, and that's kind of where the numbers are. And just to take a step back, we're kind of getting OPI in this level where it was pre the extraordinary year of 2021, 2022. If you go back in time, this is kind of where the number was. Nobody cared. We really outpaced ourselves at extraordinary 2021 and 2022. And I think now we're kind of getting back to kind of a more stabilized number.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nSo just to clarify, so there's going to be some improvements in operations, I guess, that are going to be kind of driving this year-over-year growth. But what do you think that implies in terms of the operational standpoint and the customer for your other tenants in the portfolio? How are those retailers performing? And are they going to be able to make the same sort of operational changes to benefit income?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, you're just talking about our tenant base now? Is that the question? Or.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nI guess JCPenney and SPARC.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThe ones that.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nPlus your tenants, yeah.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Okay. Okay. Well, like I said, the ones in, and the ones in SPARC and JCPenney, I really spoke to. I mean, I think generally the plan that they have in place, we think we're on the right track, and we're all working very hard to produce these results. Hopefully, we'll do better than that. Again, I mentioned to you, we're kind of getting back to where we used to be. If you looked at it in conjunction with pre-pandemic 2018, 2019, that's kind of where the number was. We really outperformed in 2021, 2022, and we really underperformed in 2023. Simple as that. Brands are good. Businesses have the right game plan, and we're moving. So that's SPARC, JCPenney. Any questions on that? Then I'll move to your other questions. I mean, retail is very specific.\nSo I think our retailers, they're generally, the credit is in really good shape. There's always one or two or three tenants that we are somewhat nervous about. But they all understand the importance of bricks and mortar. They're reinvesting in their stores. They're spending less on technology, which is good for us, putting more money back in the stores. And they're open to buying. The return on investment in stores is a proven financial model. They're doing that. So I'd say generally comfortable, very comfortable with all the retailers that we're doing business with. There'll always be a couple here and there that have to sort through their financial issues.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHong Zhang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. I guess I was wondering if you could quantify the magnitude of the development drag this year. And also, it seems like you saw very strong rents and occupancy growth in the Taubman portfolio in the Q4. Are you hearing what drove that and what your expectations for that portfolio this year as well?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nJust on Taubman, I mean, our expectations on the Comp NOI are roughly right on the in excess of 3%. What drove both portfolios really is supply and demand, healthy retail sales, operational excellence, all the things that I mentioned earlier. So listen, we're a big company. We did have some drag from redevelopment, but it's not an excuse. We don't worry about it. It's not so much big redevelopment. When you re-tenant a mall, you have downtime. And as I mentioned this before, the better the tenant out, the better the tenant, the better the build-out. And in some cases, build-out is six to nine months. And restaurants can be even close to a year. And as you know, our portfolio restaurant new business is at least 100 new restaurants over the next year or so. So it is a long, arduous process getting permits.\nI mean, we had a crazy thing in the Bay Area where they couldn't hook up the gas for a while. I encourage you to read the Supreme Court overruling of an ordinance in Berkeley that affected Palo Alto. If you're really bored, you can read it. We finally got gas back into the center. And as you know, chefs like to cook with gas. So it was a. It cost us six months and a delay. I mean, that's normal. But I'd say the bigger issue on just. It's not so much redevelopment. It is really retenanting. And I would say, by and large, if I had to make up a number, it costs us probably $0.10 to $0.20 a year of just downtime. But that's a guess.\n\nHong Zhang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. Just a couple of questions. First, your operating expenses were down in 2024. I was just curious what drove that and if that's sustainable.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Ki Bin, it's Brian. Yeah. We did see some savings year-over-year. There was some seasonality to it. Weather was a little bit lighter. But yes, we do expect it's sustainable.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. And on the ABG partial sale, was that a down-round valuation versus the $18 billion mark previously?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNo.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Remember that was enterprise value. They have some debt. So that wasn't equity value. But just when you say $18 billion, that's enterprise value as opposed to equity value. Okay?\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. No problem.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey. Good evening out there. So.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHow are you?\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nI'm doing great, sir. Hope you're well too. The question I have is on your signed but not yet open pipeline. I think last quarter, or you previously outlined, there's about 200 basis points of embedded occupancy from that signed but not yet open pipeline. Maybe you can give us an update on where that stands today, and then also maybe what's embedded in the guide for bad debt and lease term fees this year. Thank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. So signed but not open is a little bit north of 200 basis points. We've been kind of holding that as we open stores and sign new leases. So we're holding steady around 200 basis points. We are assuming a normal level of bad debt, which is about 25 basis points of total revenue, would be our expectation on that.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nLease term fees?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nNormal rate of lease term fees, I think the answer is the number for the year is about $30 million, the estimate.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOperator.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Good evening. Just a quick one for me. Just curious on the current state of affairs with Jamestown and how that relationship is progressing. More talk about mixed-use. So just curious if there's anything in the works or in the planning stages that you're doing with them and how you're thinking about that particular relationship. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYes. Thank you. So we haven't quite had a year under our belt, but we're very pleased with the relationship and the partnership. And we continue to look at opportunities both within our pipeline and obviously what they do on behalf of investors. So a lot of good feedback going both ways. And we haven't; we're working on one project. I mean, we have one development project we're working on together. But other than that, it's a lot of corporate; it's more strategic and more corporate and more of a corporate discussion than property-level specifics other than one where we are partners on and going through a development process in that now in the southeast.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to the management for closing comments.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Thank you. Obviously, Tom and Brian are available. We really appreciate everybody's participation. Talk to you soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid E. Simon\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I'm pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.08 billion or $2.88 per share. I'll walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2022. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.08 of growth primarily driven by higher rental income, higher interest income and other income of $0.04.\nHigher interest expense cost us $0.08 a in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, a $0.05 lower contribution from our other platform investments and publicly held securities compared to Q2 2022. FFO from our real estate business was $2.81 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.78 per share in the prior year period. And year-to-date, that comparison is $5.65 per share in '23 compared to $5.58 in '22.\nOur real estate business is performing ahead of our plan and overcoming the headwinds from higher interest expense, and we're also pleased with our OPI results in the quarter and continue to expect the business to meet our original 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We believe the market value of our OPI platform is approximately $3.5 billion or roughly $10 per share. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $2.1 billion year-to-date.\nDomestic property NOI increased 3.3% quarter-over-quarter and 3.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 3.7% for the quarter and 3.8% for the first half of the year. Our mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 94.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 97.3%, and TRG was 93.7%. Average base minimum rent for the malls and outlets was $56.27 per foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year.\nThis is an all-time high for our Brea Mall and the mills rent increased 4.3% to an all-time high of $36.02 per foot. Leasing momentum continued across our portfolio, we signed more than 1,300 leases for more than [ 5 ] million square feet for the quarter, and we're up to 11 million square feet year-to-date. We have a 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $470 million in occupancy cost.\nMore than 30% of our total lease activity in the first half of the year was new deal volume. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community across many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the second quarter was $747 per foot for our malls and outlets.\nThe mills at [ $677 ] per foot. We also hosted our second annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June, was very successful for shoppers and participating retailers. We generated more than 3 million shopper visits over that weekend, feedback has been great. We're also excited to continue to build on this annual event, and we expect it to continue to get bigger and bigger each year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 9 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $820 million at an average rate of 6%. Our balance sheet is strong. We have $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we're proud to announce our dividend of $1.90 per share for the third quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The dividend will be payable on September 29.\nWe have now paid over $40 billion in dividends since we've been public. We're increasing our full year guidance of 2023 from $11.80 per share to $11.95 per share to $11.85 and respectively, $11.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint. Now let me give you food for thought.\nIf I may, we have built a world-class portfolio over a long period of time since we've been public. Following our the [ Barnello ] transaction in 1996, our portfolio consisted of 119 malls and 65 strip centers, primarily in the Midwest. Since then, we have acquired 220 properties, develop more than 50 and disposed of approximately 250 properties. Of the original, 184 properties in 1996, 37 remain in our portfolio today. So our high productive portfolio is a result of constant asset rotation.\nFinally, let me conclude by saying our business is performing well and is ahead of our internal plan. Tenant demand is excellent, occupancy is increasing, base mineral rents are at record levels, property NOI is growing and again beating our internal expectations that we set at the beginning of the year, and we are now operator, ready for your questions.",

I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and I'm pleased to report our first quarter results. We are off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.03 billion United States dollars or $2.74 United States dollars per share. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter. Compared to Q1 of 2022, domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 United States dollars of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Our international operations also performed well and contributed $0.02 United States dollars of growth.\nThese positive contributions were partially offset by declines from the headwind from a strong US dollar of $0.02, higher interest rate expense of $0.05 United States dollar, lower lease settlement income of $0.06 United States dollar compared to Q1 of 2022, and we had a mark to market gain on publicly held securities of $0.06 United States dollar for the quarter and a $0.13 United States dollar lower contribution from our other platform investments compared to Q1 2022. Let me walk you through some of that and remind everyone that for OPI results we are generally on our plan. Please keep in mind OPI was up against very tough comparisons from last year's Q1.\nThis quarter also includes one-time transaction cost from ABG's recent acquisition activity, JCPenney's deployment of their New Beauty initiative, and investments related to physical stores, IT, and one-time reorganization expenses all flowing through our FFO number. The retailer part of our OPI investments has seasonality associated with it, generally with losses in the first quarter and the majority of our profit in the fourth quarter, and should be modeled accordingly. Overall, we continue to expect OPI to meet our 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, which is similar, which will be a similar FFO contribution that was.\nCompared to 2022 now. Domestic property NOI increased 4% year-over-year for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.9% for the quarter. Our Mills, malls, and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 94.4%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.3%, and TRG was 93.3%. Importantly, average base minimum rent was $55.84 United States dollar per sq ft, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1200 leases for more than 5.9 million sq ft in the quarter.\nWe have an additional 1500 deals in our pipeline including renewals for approximately $570 million United States dollars in gross occupancy cost. More than 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We're seeing strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength from many categories. By the end of Q2, we expect to be approximately 75% complete with our 2023 expiration. Retail sales momentum continued. Reported retail sales per sq ft reached another record in Q1 at $759 United States dollars per sq ft for malls and Premium Outlets combined, an increase of 3.3%.\nAll platforms achieved record sales level, including The Mills at $683 United States dollars per sq ft, a 2.2%, and TRG was $1,100 United States dollars per sq ft, a 6% increase. Good news is tourism is returning with our tourist-oriented centers outperforming the portfolio average in terms of sales. Our occupancy cost at the end of Q1 was 12%. We opened our West Paris Designer Outlet Normandy, France last week, our 35th international outlet center. During the quarter, construction restarted on our upscale outlet center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which will now open in the fall of 2024. We have several densification projects under construction and a pipeline of identified projects that includes approximately 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms.\nNow turning to the balance sheet, we completed a dual tranche US senior notes offering that totaled $1.3 billion United States dollars at a combined average term of 20 years. At an average coupon of 5.67%. We closed on our new $5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity in 2028. Importantly, the pricing is unchanged from our prior facility. The traditional secured mortgage markets continue to support the refinancing of our assets across geographies and property types. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion United States dollars of liquidity.\nToday we announced our dividend of $1.85 United States dollars per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9%. The dividend is payable on 30 June of this quarter. Guidance for this quarter. Given the results of this quarter and our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 guidance range. From $11.70 United States dollars to 11.95 United States dollars per share to 11.80 United States dollars to 11.95 United States dollars. $11.95 United States dollars per share compared to last year of $11.87 United States dollars. This is an increase of $0.10 United States dollars at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 United States dollars at the midpoint. Excuse me. I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent, and brick and mortar stores are where shoppers want to be.\nEven with the economic uncertainty, we are running ahead of our internal plan. Excuse me here. I have some kind of frog in my throat, but we're ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, sir. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star and then one on your telephone keypad. Please ensure to limit your question to just one question per analyst.

For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary for you to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions.\nThe first question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good evening, everyone. Maybe regarding upcoming lease maturities and what that means for potential cash flow changes going forward, the ABR for 23 maturities is around $62 United States dollars versus the portfolio overall at $56 United States dollars. So would you think it's fair to say that the rest of the 23 maturities may face a headwind on renewal, but then the 24 maturities, which are 12% of rents and have an ABR of $54 United States dollars, have significant opportunity? I'm guessing it's not that straightforward. So wondering if you could discuss that rent maturity and mark to market outlook.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, thank you, Caitlin, for the question. One of the numbers I threw out there while I was coughing during my presentation was, you know, our renewals and new leases will add $570 million United States dollars of basically gross rental income, and that has included some renewals. Which is the roll-off of some of the numbers that you quoted. We are renewing above our overall, above our expiring rents. So even with that said, we expect to continue to have positive rental spreads even with the higher number for the balance of this year and certainly in 2024. So the outlook on that front is very positive and unchanged since, you know, our commentary certainly at the beginning of this year and fourth quarter of last year as well.\n\nCaitlin Burrows\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Steve?\n\nSteve Sakwa\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks. Good evening, David. I was wondering if you could just maybe shed a little more light on the leasing demand that you're seeing. Is there anything that you could discuss with us on kind of price point, either luxury versus more moderate tenants, anything by region, you know, anything by product type, whether it's, you know, the mills, the outlets, the traditional malls, you know, just looking for a little color given what we're going through and kind of what your tenants are telling you, just kind of curious where the strongest demand is and maybe to the extent that there are any weak spots. What would you call out?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I mean, I know this is Kind of in the face of a lot of economic uncertainty, but demand really has not changed one iota. Now, let's talk about the luxuries. Side. You know, clearly. They're running up against tough comps compared to Q1 of last year. But. Those brands and those companies think long term. I mean the best example is if, you know, we were at the opening of the Tiffany store on 57th Street. You have to take a long-term view when you open stores like that. All of those brands, whether LVMH, Kering, Richemont, et cetera, they're looking at 2023, 2024, 2025. We're making commitments. Nothing there. Is really abated. So all systems go on that front.\nEven though they're running up against tough comps compared to Q1. You look at the restaurant category. Very strong demand. Lots of new deals across, you know, lots of price points from, you know, P.F. Chang's, Cheesecake Factory to, you know, some of the chef-driven brands. So all systems go there. You've got the box demand. Lots of new business with Dick's Lifetime Fitness, the best of the best. Scheels department store demand, Von Maur is happening. Then you look at athleisure, Vuori, Alo, Lululemon. All Brooks Brothers, you know, all of that pretty much across the board.\nYou know, we're seeing new stores. So I said this at the end of last year, early this year, even with, even though comps are going to be tougher this year in terms of sales compared to last year. The demand on leasing really has not changed. We're seeing the entertainment concepts, you know, come back. Theater business is positive. So, you know, we feel, you know, it's, we're feeling very good. You know, obviously we're cautious. We don't expect sales like they were over 2021 and 2022, and we planned accordingly. But. Demand, we check every day, and there's, you know, certainly a couple here or there that slow down, but nothing really noteworthy.\nYou know, VF, North Face, Timberland, Cotton On, they're all, you know, they're all growing and it's all pretty healthy.\n\nSteve Sakwa\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question, Ronald.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. I remember last quarter we talked about domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%, and you know, you're thinking about looking at Q1 already at 4%. Just maybe. Can you give us an update how you're thinking about that number for the rest of the year, and looking at the guidance raise, how much is that property core property NOI versus maybe other factors. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. Yeah, we're going to beat 2% and. I would hope we would do. At least three plus. I mean, there is some, it's very interesting. The first six months from a retail point of view. Comps will be tough. But we think the second half for the retailers will be more positive. Lots of economic. Uncertainty out there with the big macro things, but assuming sales come in the way we initially budgeted, we should be hopefully at least 3%. If we have an uptick in sales, we'll do better.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question, Alexander.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks and good evening, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nHow are you?\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nI'm doing well. So first, thank you for all the detail on the retailer platform and the emphasis on the seasonality. That's helpful. My question is bigger. You guys seem to have a lot of positive trends with the redevelopment program coming back. Retailer demand healthy. Obviously some of your competitors are having trouble on the capital side. It strengthens your portfolio. So my question is, as you look over the next few years to invest incremental capital, is your focus still on the best returns are internal in your existing malls and adding more densification, or are you starting to see some external opportunities where it may make sense to use capital and whether that's domestically or abroad? Sort of curious, yes.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI don't see. Let me do it in pieces with. No particular order. I do see. I still do feel strongly that the best use of our capital is making our existing portfolio better and better. I think. That's, you know, we have spent. $8 plus billion United States dollars over the last several years upgrading the portfolio and doing new development. So we continue to see that as our best use. I don't see. As I mentioned in the call, we have a residential pipeline that looks really attractive and hotels that are generating really good accretive values of around 2,000 units. Now that's not going to happen overnight, but that's going to happen over the next few years.\nSo that to us is a real opportunity. I don't see. Much of our external capital doing any kind of acquisition opportunities internationally. I still think we'll grow our international Asia outlet portfolio with redevelopment and new development over time, essentially recycling the capital, the cash flow that we have there in accretive new development. And you know, we're looking at everything domestically here and nothing. Really has whipped. I think I could say this wet our whistle here to make us. I can say that. Right? Okay. So nothing here that would.\n\nAlexander Goldfarb\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYou said it.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, I said it. True. Good point. Nothing here that would really like. We're not jumping up and down to do external, you know, an external transaction. So it's mostly the same stuff that we've been doing. You know. You know, and just keep plugging away on that. Look, I do think we have to respect the capital markets. You know, the capital markets are telling all companies to be more prudent, to do more accretive investments. We are listening very closely to that.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Vince Tibone from Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nHi, good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on your comment regarding the 2,000 residential and hotel units in the upcoming pipeline. Just curious how quickly you could start these projects, how much spend this could potentially represent. And if you, this is something that you're going to maybe do through joint ventures or would be wholly owned on the balance sheet, and any color on some of these points would be helpful.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSure. All right, so I think we will do selected JVs. On certain of the residential. Development. So that's, and it may, it also may be that we could potentially bring in third party equity too. So that would, you know, we'll look at each deal individually, but that's certainly a possibility. And then I think events, essentially. We're looking at, you know, to reach all those 2,000 units, it's really probably a five-year, five-year build process. We expect to start several this year. But yet we're, you know, frankly being a little bit cautious. We're, you know, we're still permitting some things in California and.\nYou know, the Northwest. So we don't, you know, we're going to just see how the world is, but we don't have to make a decision yet. I would think at the end of the day, you know, off the top, you know, I'd rather Brian give you a more scientific number because a lot of these are part of redevelopments too. So to really isolate the hotel, apartment or rental stuff, I'd want to give you a number, but my instinct would be probably about $1.5 billion United States dollars. But I think Brian can give you a more detailed number, but somewhere in that range. These go from Austin, Texas, to Orange County, California, to Seattle. Some hotels.\nIn Florida, some residential in Florida, multifamily. So it's kind of where you'd expect it to be, where supply and demand is in our favor. But we're considering building a hotel in Cape Cod. Because we think there's a good supply-demand imbalance there. So it really is across and every, I'd say, generally as we get back real estate through our redevelopment efforts. The big focus is on where we can add some. Mixed uses, because we do think, like what we did in Buckhead, is having a tremendous impact on the overall value of that real estate. So not only is it accretive from a value point of view just on.\nThe cost to the return on the build versus, you know, what the value that is after it's built, but also, you know, the residual benefits that we see from them all.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nGot it. No, that's all super helpful. Somewhat related follow-up question. Just curious if you could share any updates on the Carson Outlet project and if you think you'd be moving forward there in the near term.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThat's a complicated one. We are. That's a complicated one. But where every day we make progress. It's terrific real estate, very complicated transaction, but we continue to make progress. No final decision has been made to do it. I expect one to be made over the next few months.\n\nVince Tibone\n\nAnalyst, Green Street\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Craig Mailman from Citi. Please proceed with your question, Craig.\n\nNick Joseph\n\nAnalyst, Craig Mailman\n\nThanks. It's actually Nick Joseph here with Craig Mailman just on executive comp and the. $24 million United States dollars one-time cash bonus related to OPI. I know at least one of the. Proxy analysis firms has raised some concerns on it. So, hoping you could give some more. Color on both the rationale behind it in terms of the amount and the. Structure of it ahead of the vote later this week.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, look, I think. You know, this was, you know, essentially paid to 23, 24 executives. Last February, so about 15 months ago, fully disclosed in an 8-K. Our rationale and reasoning by the comp committee was fully disclosed in our filed proxy as well as a supplemental letter to our shareholders. You know, I think. You know, if you look at the company in totality, which is important, I mean, we can always pick a moment in time to say why this, why that. But if you look at the history of the company. You look at executive comp, you look at our stock program, you look at our burn rate, you look at our G&A as a function of our NOI or asset value.\nWe are at the lowest of the low. Anybody can pick out one particular number they don't like. But if you look at it in totality. We are absolutely proud of how we run this business. If you want to get more detail, I encourage you to talk to head of our comp committee, our lead independent director. Any Shareholder can do that. But I would encourage everyone to look at the totality of our history and then come to whatever conclusion they think, and we're very happy to, you know, to talk to anybody, you know, that would like to go through it from a shareholder point of view.\n\nNick Joseph\n\nAnalyst, Craig Mailman\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotia Bank\n\nHey, good evening, David. I just want to make sure that I understand that $570 million United States dollars gross rental income number that you mentioned. Is that new and renewal leases? Is it on a pro rata basis, inclusive of international and TRG? How much of that, I guess, is incremental to in-place rents or is all of it? And then what's the time frame that you contributed?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nAll terrific questions. And. We highlighted that just to give you a sense of the scope of the business that's going on here. That's a huge number. That's just one lease. One level of activity in the year. And it's bigger than some companies that exist today. So let me try to unpack it. It does include renewals. It's just SPG, it's just domestic. If you look at the renewals in the new business, there's a really good uptick from kind of the in place income on that. That will come in not really this year, but over 2024 and 2025 as those stores get open. I think it just adds a sense of our future growth that we see in front of us from our existing portfolio.\nBut I'm not in a position to break it out between renewals and new incremental business. But you'll see that flow through the NOI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotia Bank\n\nOkay, so it is both though, because you mentioned 100 million of new income last quarter of new NOI.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nCorrect? Okay. Yeah, it includes both. Correct.\n\nGreg McGinniss\n\nAnalyst, Scotia Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Derek.\n\nDerek Johnston\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi everyone. Good afternoon. You know, occupancy is now at 94.4% and you know, that's just 70 basis points below pre-pandemic levels. Do you expect to surpass Q1 2019's 95.1% occupancy this year? And given the leasing demand we've discussed, how is the team weighing occupancy versus rates now that the gap is so narrow?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, let me take that part first. I do think. You know, the good news is that when we're, you know, and again, every lease is different, every relationship's different. You know, rollovers, you know, you know, some rollovers go down. But I would say generally speaking. We are finally seeing renewals that are. Overall, above the expiring rents. So that, and part of that is just supply and demand is in our favor. And we are getting, you know, because one is. I think from the retailer's point of view, there's a real appreciation for bricks and mortar.\nOne, two, is they know we're a landlord that they can rely on and that we're going to do the right thing to maintain and reinvest in these properties and we have the capability of doing so. Generally more demand that we're seeing, and the retailers are in having survived COVID or in better shape and want to grow their business. So. You know, that is all happening. Getting to your first point. Will we beat it this year? It'll be close. I'm not, you know. I can't guarantee it, but I am hopeful that we will beat that number, you know, and then, you know, certainly within the next 12 months, you know, assuming we can continue to maintain reasonably decent economic. Conditions.\n\nDerek Johnston\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nSenior REIT Analyst, Compass Point\n\nThanks. Good evening, guys. David, so maybe if you can give us a little bit more of an update, I know in the past you've talked about your signed not open pipeline being around 200 basis points. Your leased occupancy just increased by 110 basis points. Is that SNO pipeline relatively similar? And then maybe, I mean, if I look at the base rent going up by 3.1% approximately, and if you get about 10% of your space back, I mean, it assumes, you know, pretty healthy releasing spreads, if my math is correct. I mean, how should we be thinking? Because practically it appears that leasing spreads are accelerating in your core business.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI think that's a fair statement. I would say that the pipeline is similar to what it's been. You know. Right. Yeah, of course, we're still hanging right around 200 basis points at this point in the year. So I do think it, you know, as we been saying over the last few couple quarters, I mean, we have finally turned the corner on. Lease spreads demand, better properties, more commitments from retailers. And, you know, more retailers wanting to open stores, all driving, all driving pretty good demand, which allows us to get the spreads that we're, you know, that we were accustomed to. But, you know, we were flatlining pre-COVID.\nObviously we got hurt during COVID and we bounced back nicely. And so from that standpoint. It's good to see.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nSenior REIT Analyst, Compass Point\n\nIf I can maybe follow up, David, on Jamestown and you mentioned external capital. How are you thinking about how is the Jamestown acquisition bedding in, and is that potentially a source of external capital that you can bring into some of the apartment or hotel investments? And or how are the synergies between those two businesses working out? In particular, I'm thinking like Atlanta with the street retail right near your two fortress malls.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah. Look to separate, you know. Just to be clear. So. We bought into the asset management business and we bought. We partnered with Jamestown for a couple of, you know, several reasons, but a couple to highlight here. One is they're really good asset managers. Two is they have a development capability that's very interesting to us and they have excellent institutional relationships. And we think with our partnership we can grow that business. We did not. Other than. There is a big. Future development master plan development that they're working on in Charleston, where we did partner with them directly.\nWe did not buy any of their existing real estate that's owned by the various funds, whether it's the German funds or. The Premier fund. Jamestown is in the process of raising their, what, 32nd German fund. They have a lot of separate account interest. It's really good for us because we get to learn those institutional investors better and more. I just think we're early days there. I think the thesis that we had going in continues to. Be very, very valid. This is a long-term relationship that I think will grow. Eventually, I see us partnering with institutional money that will be managed by Jamestown that will partner with us to build XYZ, or buy XYZ, or build.\nA big community in Charleston. North Charleston. So yeah, I think all of that elements of. Potential growth with Jamestown is out there. We do like the asset management business. As a platform, we dipped our toe into it. But I think, you know, again, just as we look at the landscape of real estate owners and managers, we think, you know, when we look at a Blackstone, when we look at a Brookfield, you know, obviously they own, they asset manage. For us to have some. Scale or some role in that business, I think ultimately will inure to the benefit of Simon Property Group. And that's what we're after.\n\nFloris van Dijkum\n\nSenior REIT Analyst, Compass Point\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, Craig.\n\nCraig Schmidt\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Given the seasonality of the OPI business. Which quarter do you expect that number to turn positive?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nI think it will be. You know, Craig, you know about retailers. So just to reinforce. The retail part of OPI, remember, the vast majority of the OPI value is in our ABG stock. But we still have a very profitable business with both Penny and Spark and then other investments that are in that, including RGG and so on. So just important to put it in context. So the retail part, the pure retailer part, Penny and Spark is seasonal. You know, last quarter, Q1 2022 was, you know, just, you know, stimulus, whatever was a really tough comparison for the retail retailer part of OPI.\nWith that said, it will, we expect it to be profitable in Q2 and Q3 and you know, but the vast, the majority of it, the vast majority of it will be Q4 like all the other retailers. So when you see retailers, you know, report this quarter that are public, I think generally they'll probably all have tough comps against Q1 of last year, yet the comps get a lot easier. This is a lot more information for a business that we have no cash investment, remember. It does create a little volatility of our earnings. You know, for better or worse, in this case this quarter, it's worse. Fourth quarter will be much better. Does create a little volatility but.\nYou know, you'll see it map out part of that OPI, map out just like other retailers where the loss will be in Q1, profitability in Q2 and Q3, and then you know, 70%, 65%, 70% in Q4.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, good afternoon. Just hoping to get a little color. On the month-to-month leases, they picked up from about 4.5% to 7.5 sequentially in Q1. While you did a fantastic job chopping wood and reducing the rest of the 2023 expirations, just curious on why the increase. In the month to month. This isn't. What's going on behind that?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, one of the comments I made was, we expect to be basically 75% by the end of Q2. It's just a process. It's just, you know, we're negotiating, the retailers are negotiating. The stores are open and operating. But. It's just a typical drawn-out process that. It's so to speak the art of the negotiation. But a lot of that's already handshake committed to that. We're just going through and processing now.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nIf you look historically one, it's normal seasonality of that line item at this point in time in the year.\n\nJuan Sanabria\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. That was my follow-up. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question, Mike.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. I was wondering, has there been any notable change in lease duration for what you're signing so far in 2023 compared to last year?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nNot really. Not at all.\n\nMike Mueller\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, that was it. Thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, good evening, Dave. I think earlier you mentioned that new leases were 25% of deal volume in the first quarter. I guess I'm curious if that's why CapEx picked up 8% in the quarter and if this is also a new level of new versus renewal leasing that you should expect in your term. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWe have a tough, tough connection. Did you guys hear that?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nCan you repeat your question, please? You kind of broke up a bit.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nSorry about that. So my question was on David. I think you mentioned earlier in the call that new leases were 25% of the deal volume in the first quarter. So I'm curious if that's why Capex was up, I think 8% in the first quarter. And also if this level of new leases 25% or so would be kind of the right way to think about new versus renewal leasing going forward. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, I think, I guess on the TA line there is some. We are doing more deals, so there is probably more TA associated with it. So. I'm not sure, you know, the CapEx line or you're looking at the TA line, but generally the answer is yes, we're doing a lot more new business, and in some cases that does mean a little bit more TA. I still had a hard time on the last part. Did anybody hear it? No, we didn't hear it. Unfortunately, we didn't hear it. But if you want to call back with, you know, we're happy to answer that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Moving on to the next question, the next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. Going back to your comments on international tourism, David, can you remind us where international tourism levels are for your portfolio today versus, let's say, pre-COVID and if it should return to that normal level, what does that mean for? Simon's NOI or earnings, however you want to look at it?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I would say generally speaking, you know, we, you know, just to give you a sense, our sales for our tourist properties that we identified was up 8% quarter over quarter. Right. Generally.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYep.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSo the bottom line is it's really going to result in overage rent that we probably flatlined more or less on those properties. So you know that. And that will manifest itself once we reach the breakpoint. So later in the year. But you know, we're seeing, we're starting to see, you know, I mean, like Vegas, you know, where our tourist properties are, Florida, which has been pretty strong, but we're seeing more and more international tourism there, Woodbury here in the New York area.\nI say here I'm in Indianapolis. But you know, in the New York area is really starting to see a lot more international tourism. California has been kind of the weak link, but we're starting to see more and more sales there. And then Vegas is just going crazy. Vegas. You know, we have really important exposure in Vegas between Forum, Crystals, our two outlet centers. Vegas is as good as it gets. It's the casinos, what's going on with the city, and the movement from California to Nevada. All of the football, baseball, sporting activity, Formula One. It's just a great place to have a lot of retail real estate.\nWe're seeing real benefits in that. This will manifest itself in the fourth quarter as we're seeing that, you know. But you know, as we reach the breakpoints, we're finally seeing the international tourists come back to the States. A little weaker dollar helps. And obviously all the. I think finally you don't have a vaccine card or whatever is required. Come here. All of that kind of yesterday's news as of today or yesterday. So. We're, you know, I think we're finally starting to see that comeback like it was pre-pandemic.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nOkay, and a quick question for Brian. You guys have a pretty healthy cash balance of over $1 billion United States dollars, yet you still carry a balance on the revolver. I'm sure there's a pretty logical, simple answer to this, but just curious.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, that's exactly right. The outstandings on our revolver are denominated in Euros, and they serve as a net investment hedge against our asset base in Europe. We do have a sizable cash balance as we did our offering earlier in this year and pre-funded the balance of our unsecured maturities for this year. So we're carrying cash, and we'll pay off the June maturities at par at maturity.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question, David. Your base minimum rent growth is accelerating. You have a nice SNO pipeline. You're talking about blowing past your 2% NOI growth guidance for the year. All sounds great. I guess the question is how sustainable is this algorithm? How long can it continue, and what are the factors that are ultimately going to weigh on this momentum that you have?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, look, you know, I mean, I think I see it continuing. We see good demand. You know, we are tied to the general economic condition, but you know, supply, demand is in our favor. You know, I think our spot in our industry is well established. We have the confidence with our retail partners. We know what we want to do with our properties. We're not, you know, we don't bat a thousand. We, you know, we make mistakes all the time, but you know, we know where we want to position them. And. You know, so I hate using kind of this, but I, you know, it's really going to be the external environment that could slow this down.\nMeaning, you know, what happens, you know, do we do a recession or that? And I honestly think some of these markets are, you know, when people ask me that, I actually think if we do go into a recession it'll be, you know, quote this kind of regional recession. I just don't see. Markets right now. They may. Flatten, they may not grow as much. But I don't see Florida's, Texas, Nevada's of the world, you know, Georgia's. I just don't see them. So I don't see them going into a recession. So if there is one, you know, we've always heard, well, you know it's going to be a regional one. This one might be one. But you know, who might have, I really don't know. But I think that's what slows us down. Obviously we do have some headwinds with higher interest rates. You know, we do have, you know, debt maturity at low rates that are rollover will cost us some growth. You know, but we just have to kind of go through that and deal with it.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. How do you think about the longer-term growth rate profile of the OPI business versus growth in overall portfolio NOI? Do you think the OPI business requires more consistent investment before it generates more stable returns?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, I think you have to look at it, the individual investments and. For instance, Authentic Brands Group is a growth machine. We're buying brands left and right. They're buying Billabong, they're buying Vince. They've got a huge pipeline. So I really see that company growing, growing, growing. Spark and Penny are. Spark is opening new stores, getting better at e-commerce. Getting better operating, I'm sure, sure. Overall, you know, they added Reebok to its portfolio last year that still hasn't been fully integrated. So, you know, I expect EBITDA growth to accelerate in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. You know, RGG, which includes Rue La La, Gilt, and importantly, Shop Premium Outlets.\nRemember, we contributed that to that joint venture. Shop Premium Outlets is on fire. We're growing our GMV by leaps and bounds. I really think this was an idea we had years ago. We kind of got it off the ground. Maybe not quite as good as Wilbur. Wilbur Wright, but we got it off the ground. We merged it into RGG, and it's really rocking and rolling. We've got, you know, we're signing up good retailers all the time. That's got a great, great story to it. And we have some smaller investments in that. So I think I see a real growth pattern in all of those. JCPenney is reinvesting. I think JCPenney has found its mojo. It's getting better brands in the store. We're making the stores look better. It's got growth in beauty. That's investing.\nSo, you know, the retailer side of OPI has a little more exposure to the economy because, you know, retail just does. But I think they all in their own right have their own growth story. But you know what? You know, we're economic animals to the extent that we think we get fair value. You know, we've got lots of opportunities to invest in our company or other transactions that will add value to. So we look at these very clinically. I just remember we've created a lot of value here with very little capital. And what's amazing, it's in our earnings now. Which is a good sign because it means it's earning money.\nGiven the small investment it's been, if you just want to look on. Return on earnings or return on investment, it's been outstanding. So very proud of it. Very profitable. Not our core focus yet. I used our executive team here to leverage our capabilities, intellectual firepower, et cetera, to, you know, to make those companies better. And I think we've done a pretty darn good job. And we've had good partners across the board. So we've done it in a very prudent way. And.It's been very beneficial for us. I expect growth to continue, you know, have more ups and downs. Won't be a straight line, but I have, I expect more growth from that category. Same time, you know.\n10 years from now or five years from now. We don't have to own any of these companies.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks for that. And then just a follow up. Do you have a sense of how much mixed use development could become as a percentage of portfolio NOI? Could you give us a sense? Of what that might represent today?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nIt's not very big today. What is it, like 3-4%?\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nAbout 3.3%.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nSo, you know, we're a big company. So to do a lot to get to like, you know, 8 to 10 would take a lot would be a few years down the road. But I don't see any reason why, you know, we certainly should try to strive to get up there if we can do it accretively in the kind of the 7-8% range. But you know, that would be roughly $500 million United States dollars plus of NOI. So it's not, you know, it's not. It's not. It's going to take time.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question, the final question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey there. Thanks for letting me back in. I wanted to get to the second part of my question and then I have one more. So the second part of my earlier question was if you're expecting new lease volume to be about 25% of the overall leasing volume as they were in the first quarter over the near term?\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nYeah, I think that's a reasonable number. Yes, in that range.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nAnd then the second question I had was on foot traffic. We saw some recent Placer foot traffic data for March indicating that year-over-year foot traffic at enclosed retail malls is down 8% year-over-year in March. I'm curious if you're seeing similar trends at your properties and if you think that's a reflection of the consumer and if that's coming up in lease negotiations in the current environment. Thanks.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nWell, yeah, I'm glad you asked that because I have, you know, we keep track of that ourselves. Just to give you March over March 2023 over. 22 March, we are 105.5% for malls, 105.6% for Mills, and 120.2% for outlets for 108% above last year. This time in January and February, we're actually much higher. Month over month. So we, for our portfolio, we're above. Traffic is above where it was this time last year. Year to date, month to month.\n\nHaendel St. Juste\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian McDade\n\nCFO, Simon Property Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Simon for closing remarks. Thank you, sir.\n\nDavid Simon\n\nChairman, CEO, and President, Simon Property Group\n\nOkay. Thank you and appreciate the questions. We'll talk soon. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, sir. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you very much for your participation.",

Welcome to the Simon Property Group Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Tom Ward. You may begin.\n\nThomas Ward\n\nSVP of IR, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sammy. Good evening from Atlanta. Thank you for joining us this evening.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. Our conference call this morning, this afternoon will be limited to 1 hour. For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to 1 question.\nI'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid E. Simon\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nGood evening from Phipps Plaza, where we recently completed our transformation, including a new office building, a new Nobu Hotel and a Life Time resort. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results.\nWe generated approximately $4.5 billion in FFO in 2022 or $11.95 per share. On a comparable basis, full year FFO per share was $11.87, an increase of 3.8% year-over-year. We returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and shares. And total dividends today paid since our IPO now totals approximately $39 billion. We invested approximately $1 billion, including accretive development projects and expanding our other investment platform into the growing asset and investment management businesses with our Jamestown partnership. These consistent strong results are testament to the quality of our portfolio, a relentless focus on operational and cost structure, disciplined capital allocation and our team's commitment to our shoppers and communities.\nFourth quarter funds from operations were $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net gain of $0.25 per share, principally from the sale of our interest in the Eddie Bauer licensing JV in exchange for additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, Authentic. We now own 12% of Authentic valued at approximately $1.5 billion.\nLet me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2021. Our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.23 of growth, driven primarily by higher rental income and with some lower operating expenses. These positive contributions were partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.03 at a $0.15 lower contribution from our other platform investments.\n2021 was a great year for our retailers. However, in 2022, Forever 21 and JCPenney were affected by inflationary pressures and consumers reducing their spend. Despite not achieving the same profitability that we did in 2021, we are pleased on how we and the management teams dealt with the unanticipated external environment.\nTurning to domestic property NOI. We increased 5.8% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 6.3% for the quarter and 5.7% for the year. Occupancy for malls and outlets at the end of the fourth quarter was 94.9%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to prior year and an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. Renewals occupancy was 98.2%, and TRG was 94.5%. Average base minimum rent was $55.13 per foot, an increase of 2.3% year-over-year.\nFor the year, we signed 4,100 leases for more than 14 million square feet. Over 2 years, we've now signed 8,000 leases for more than 29 million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline that will open for a late 2023 and 2024 openings. Reported retailer sales momentum continued. We reached another record in the fourth quarter at $753 per square foot with the malls and outlets combined, an increase of 6% year-over-year.\nAll platforms achieved record sales levels, including the mills, it's $679 per square foot which was a 5% increase. TRG was $1,095 per square foot, an 11% increase, and our occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 12%.\nWe opened a new development in 2022, our 10th premium outlet in Japan. Construction continues, our new outlet in Normandy, France, west of Paris. This will be our second outlet in France and our 35th international outlet. Our international outlet platform is a hidden jewel for SPG. As a frame of reference, it is bigger and much more profitable with much higher sales per square foot than another public company's portfolio.\nWe completed 14 redevelopments, and we will complete another major redevelopment project this year at some of our most productive properties. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on 6 to 8 mixed-use projects. All of this will be funded with our internally generated cash flow.\nNow turning to other platform investments in the fourth quarter, it contributed $0.23 per share in FFO compared to $0.38 in the prior year period. For the year, OPI contributed $0.64 in FFO compared to $1.07 in the prior year. We are pleased with the contribution from our OPI investments, especially given our de minimis cash investment we've made in these companies.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We completed refinancing on 20 property mortgages for a total of $2.3 billion at an average interest rate of 5.33%. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. Our fixed coverage ratio is 4.8x, and we ended the year with approximately $7.8 billion of liquidity. In 2022, we paid approximately $2.6 billion of common stock dividends in cash. We announced $1.80 per share this quarter, which is a 9% increase over the same period last year. The dividend is payable at the end of March -- at the end of this quarter, on March 31. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $98.57 in 2022.\nMoving on to '23. Our comparable FFO guidance is $11.70 to $11.95 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%; increased interest expense compared to 2022 of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 per share, reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions; similar OPI investment contribution, FFO contribution compared to 2022; the continuing impact of the strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and the yen; no significant acquisition or disposition activity; and a diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares.\nTo conclude, we had another excellent year, effectively navigating external headwinds that included rising interest rates, strong U.S. dollars, inflation and a somewhat softening economy. We have consistently posted industry-leading results through our hard work, innovation, great people and great assets, and we are -- continue to be excited about our plans for 2023. If you come to Atlanta, you will see what we're doing, and it's a great example of the future growth prospects of our company. And will now allow for Q&A. Thank you.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tom Ward. Thank you. Mr. Ward, you may begin.\n\nThomas Ward\n\nSVP of IR, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Erin, and thank you all for joining us this morning.

Simon\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter results. Third quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.97 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.04 from a mark-to-market in fair value publicly held securities.\nLet me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter, and contributed $0.05 of growth driven by higher rental income. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter, and increased $0.05 despite the negative currency impact of $0.05, given the strength in the dollar.\nThese positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok integration cost and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from our 2 value-oriented brands.\nDomestic property net operating income increased 2.3% for the quarter and 4.4% for the first 9 months of the year. NOI growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the write-off of outstanding receivables from Regal theaters upon its bankruptcy filing. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, at constant currency grew 3.2% for the quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months of the year.\nOccupancy ended third quarter, 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points compared to the second quarter. TRG was 94.5%. Average base minimum rent increased for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80, an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued. We signed nearly 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and have signed over 3,100 leases for more than 10 million square feet through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. The opening rate on our new leases has increased 10% since last year, roughly $6 per lease.\nReported retail sales momentum continued. Our shopper remains resilient. We reported another record in the third quarter of $749 per square foot for the malls and outlets, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15% increase. TRG was $1,080 per foot, a 25% increase. Our occupancy cost is at 12%, which is a level not seen since early 2015.\nWe opened our tenth premium outlet in Japan and started construction on a significant expansion at Busan in South Korea. Our redevelopment pipeline is moving forward with more accretive projects. Turning to our other platform investments in the third quarter contributed $0.17 in FFO per share as compared to $0.28 in the prior year period after cash distributions received. We have approximately $475 million of net investment within our other platform investments, primarily in ABG and RGG.\nWe expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI. That is, for those of you like math is a 60% return on investment. We believe the value of our investments in OPI is over $2 billion. We recently announced our strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm. We see great opportunity with this investment to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses. The Jamestown team, our experienced, mixed-use operators, developers, property managers and asset managers were pleased to expand our investment platform with this best-in-class operator, and we expect to grow their asset management business and accelerate our densification opportunities. We anticipate this accretive transaction to close prior to the end of this year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing 16 property mortgages during the first 9 months of the year for a total of $1.8 billion at an average interest rate of 4.78%. Our balance sheet is strong, with approximately $8.6 billion of liquidity. Net debt to EBITDA is at 5.7x and our fixed charge coverage is over 5x. Today, we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter. The dividend is payable on December 30. Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share.\nGiven our current view for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77 per share to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share compared to $11.44 last year. So that's an increase of 13% at the bottom end of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint and an increase of $0.26 at the midpoint compared to our initial guidance for the year. This guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.\nNow just let me conclude by saying we had another impressive quarter. And before we get to questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you for nearly 30 years as a public company, like many companies and industries, we have dealt with significant shifts within our industry. In our case, we embrace these challenges and our better operators and more thoughtful and astute capital allocation -- allocators. Many have tried to kill off physical retail real estate and in particular, in closed malls, and I need not remind you, when physical retail was closed in COVID, all the naysayers saying that physical retail was gone forever.\nHowever, brick and mortar is strong -- the brick-and-mortar retailer is strong and e-commerce is flatlining. And importantly, over this period of time, we have paid out $39 billion in dividends to shareholders as we have become stronger and more profitable. And why do I bring this up constantly? Well, because hopefully, this will put in into the so-called negative mall narrative, as you can't pay those dividends without a strong underlying business.\nNow operator, we're ready for questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid E. Simon\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nThank you. Please to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.96 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.05 from a mark-to-market and fair value of publicly held securities.\nLet me walk you through the big variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2021. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter and contributed $0.13 of growth driven by higher rental income of $0.09, strong performance in Simon Brand Ventures and short-term leasing of $0.05. TRG contributed $0.04 of growth, and they were partially offset by higher operating costs of approximately $0.05.\nOur international operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.10. Lower interest rate -- interest expense contributed $0.03, and these $0.26 of positive contributions were partially offset by the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.03 and a $0.19 lower contribution from our other platform investments, principally from JCPenney and a couple of brands within SPARC. These costs include -- these included costs associated with JCPenney's launch of new brands, the recent Reebok transaction and the integration costs associated with that and a softening of sales from our value-oriented brands due to inflationary pressures on that consumer.\nWe generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which was $200 million higher than the first quarter of this year. And we have generated $2.2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Domestic property NOI increased 3.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 5.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, grew 4.6% for the quarter and 6.7% for the first 6 months.\nOccupancy at the end of the second quarter was 93.9%, an increase of 210 basis points and TRG was at 93.4%. The number of tenant terminations this year has been at record low levels. Average base rent increased -- average base minimum rent increase for the third quarter in a row and was at $54.58.\nLeasing momentum accelerated across our portfolio. We signed nearly 1,300 leases for more than 4 million square feet in the quarter, have signed over 2,200 leases for more than 7 million square feet through the first half of the year, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Nearly 40% of our total leasing activity in the first 6 months of the year has been new deal volume. This is up approximately 25% from last year.\nRetail sales continued. Mall sales volumes for the second quarter were up 7%. Our reported retailer sales per square foot reached another record in the second quarter at $746 per square foot for the malls and the outlets combined, which was an increase of 26%, $674 for the mills, a 29% increase. TRG was at $1,068 per square foot, a 35% increase.\nWe began our national outlet shopping day, which was very successful from shoppers and participating retailers offering a timely first-of-its-kind power shopping experience. More than 3 million shoppers visited our premium outlets and mills over the shopping weekend. Feedback following the event has been tremendous from both our retailers and consumers. We're already planning next year's event, which we expect to be bigger. So please stay tuned on that. Our occupancy cost at the end of the quarter are the lowest they've been in 7 years, 12.1% in Q2 of 2022.\nNow our other platform of investments, let's talk about it. We were pleased with the results of our investments in the platform for the second quarter. They contributed approximately $0.21 in FFO, even though we were down from last year's terrific results, primarily, as I mentioned, continued investment and the inflationary pressures that have developed.\nBased on our distributions -- based upon our cash distributions received, we have no cash equity investment in SPARC and JCPenney. And in fact, we have parlayed our SPARC investment into our investment in ABG that is now worth over $1 billion. There will be a little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter when it comes to SPARC and JCPenney, but please keep in -- this in the proper perspective. It's all upside from here.\nDuring the quarter, we also, as I mentioned, had our mark on our SoHo and Lifetime Holdings of $0.05. A reminder on that it's a noncash mark, and we would expect that those companies would bounce back. We completed the refinancing of 14 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $1.6 billion at an average interest rate of 3.75%. We reduced our share of total indebtedness by more than $650 million. And once again, our balance sheet is strong. We had $8.5 billion of liquidity. $8.5 billion.\nToday, we announced our dividend of $1.75 per share for the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 17%. This will be payable at the end of the third quarter, September 30. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $144 million.\nAnd let me point out while other companies in our sector are paying little or no dividends and issuing equity, we are repeatedly raising our dividend and buying our stock back. We have now returned more than $37 billion of capital to our shareholders since we've been public. $37 billion.\nGiven our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.60 to $11.75 per share to the new range of $11.70 to $11.77 per share, which compares to a comparable number of last year of $11.44 per share. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.06 at the midpoint of the range. The guidance comes in the face, obviously, of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and the inflationary pressures that are out there in the marketplace.\nSo let me conclude. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Our business is strong. With a higher income consumers in good shape, brick and mortar stores are where the shoppers want to be, outpacing e-commerce across the world and the broad retail spectrum. Demand for our space is extremely strong.\nWorldwide retailers need to grow, and they're doubling down on the U.S. International tourism is returning. Domestic tourism is strong. Our redevelopment pipeline is growing with exciting projects. And in addition to our newly announced premium outlet, new developments and expansions, we are experienced at managing our business through volatile periods, including leveraging our existing platform for operating efficiencies, allocating capital appropriately, managing risks.\nWe are not over our skis in any aspect of our business. I encourage you to look at our track record. We outperform in these kinds of periods, and we also do some of our best work as well.\nSo thank you, operator. We're ready for any questions at this moment.",

(Operator Instructions) I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid E. Simon\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nI'm pleased to report our first quarter results. First quarter funds from operations were $1.046 billion or $2.78 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.08 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter despite being negatively impacted from the surging U.S. dollar. We are also very pleased with the results from our other platform investments.\nWe generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. Domestic property NOI increased 7.5% year-over-year for the quarter. And our international properties, as I mentioned, performed well, driving portfolio NOI growth to 8.8%. Occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 93.3%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year and a decrease of only 10 basis points compared to our seasonally high fourth quarter year-end of 2021. The number of tenant terminations in the first quarter was the lowest recorded in the last 5 years, and our TRG portfolio occupancy was 93.2%. At quarter end, average base minimum rent increased compared to the fourth quarter and was $54.14. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and had a significant number of leases in our pipeline. In fact, at our recent leasing deal committee, we approved the most deals since 2016. And overall, we recently have approved approximately 500 new deals representing 2 million square feet.\nDemand is very strong. And interesting, with the volatility of the world, our portfolio in the U.S. is in great demand from worldwide brands, restaurants and entertainment operators as most retailers and tenants view the U.S. as the place to be.\nSales momentum continued for our retailers. Mall sales volume for the first quarter were up 19% year-over-year. We reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $734 per square foot for the mall and outlet, combined 43% increase. And $669 per square foot for the mills, which was a 50% increase. TRG reported $1,038 per square foot, which was a 52% year-over-year increase. Our occupancy cost is the lowest that we've had in 7 years.\nWe are pleased with the results of our other platform investments in the first quarter, including SPARC Group and J.C. Penney. J.C. Penney's liquidity position is strong at $1.3 billion, and it has no borrowings on its line of credit and performed better than planned. I can say the same for SPARC, which also performed better than planned in the quarter. SPARC also completed the U.S. Reebok transaction, and we anticipate great things from this iconic brand. Remember, we expect Reebok to incur operating losses for SPARC in 2022 due to the integration aspects of the transaction. SPARC financial position, like Penney, is strong with the recent refinancing of its ABL. And it is, in fact, a net cash positive position.\nDuring the quarter, however, our investments in Soho House and Life Time Holdings, which both became public companies at the end of last year, were impacted by overall market volatility, driving an $0.08 unrealized noncash mark-to-market. These are high-quality businesses that fit with our flywheel of unique companies, and we believe these investments will generate value above our bases as they fully reopen and reengage with their customers.\nOn the balance sheet front, we completed very timely a dual tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.2 billion, including a 10-year fixed-rate offering at 2.65% early in the year. We used the net proceeds to pay off amounts outstanding on our credit facility. We also refinanced 7 mortgages for a total of $1.1 billion at an average interest rate of 2.92%, and our liquidity stands at $8 billion.\nNow today, we announced our dividend of $1.70 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 21%. The dividend will be payable on June 30. Including our dividends declared today, we paid more than $37 billion in dividends over our years as a public company, $37 billion. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $2 billion that will become effective on May 16.\nWhen we look at the valuation of our stock today at an FFO multiple of approximately 10x relative to the historical valuations closer to 15x and an implied cap rate of around 7% for our real estate assets, we see substantial value in our stock, particularly given our belief and conviction in our future growth opportunities.\nOur balance sheet is strong, continues to be a significant advantage for us while our cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to adapt as conditions warrant. And as we have proved countless times, we will be thoughtful and opportunistic on the buyback. And keep in mind, this is in addition to the more than 20% increase in our dividend we announced today.\nNow given our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.50 to $11.70 per share to $11.60 to $11.75 per share, which compares to our comparable number of $11.44 last year. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top, or an 8% increase at the midpoint. This does not include the previously mentioned unrealized loss or gain that may occur the rest of the year on our fair value of investments that I mentioned. And please keep in mind that this guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates.\nNow just to conclude, I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent, and our real estate is a great hedge in inflationary times. Hopefully, our operating results and our announced stock buyback authorization today reinforces that we are primarily focused internally and growing our existing platforms organically. And I think that will conclude my comments. We're ready for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nThomas Ward\n\nSVP of IR, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hector. Good evening, and thank you for joining us today.

(Operator Instructions)\nI'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\n\nDavid E. Simon\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\nWe had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year. We recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results. We generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in '21 or $11.94 per share. The $4.5 billion is a record amount for our company for the -- for a year. And coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments, coupled with coherent strategy.\nFourth quarter funds from operations were 1.160 billion -- I'm sorry, $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest. Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year.\nOur international operations improved in the quarter. Domestic property NOI increased 22.4% year-over-year -- I'm sorry, for the quarter and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties, portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year-over-year.\nAverage base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent. For the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet. This was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last 6 years.\nRetail sales, reported retail sales continued in the fourth quarter. Mall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 34% year-over-year. Reported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our Mall and Outlet Business and $645 for the Mills. These results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for '21. Occupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they've been in 5 years at 12.6% year-end.\nWe opened 2 new developments in 2021, one in the U.K. and a premium outlet in South Korea. Construction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie France opening the spring of '23. We completed 5 significant redevelopments. We added densification components with the opening of 2 hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility.\nProgress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall. We have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow.\nLet me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe. JCPenney's results were impressive. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion. Company delevered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit. CEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer. RGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth. SPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There's a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise. The Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach.\nTRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80% posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting. Reported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year-over-year. Occupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We've been active in the debt markets. We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a lower pricing grid for 5 years. We issued $2.75 billion of senior notes EUR 750 million notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%. We paid more than $4 billion in debt and delevered by $1.5 billion. And with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion.\nNow just to turn to dividend. We paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%. This dividend is payable on March 31.\nNow just to go through guidance for 2022. Our FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share. When looking at our '22 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to '21 actual results. Approximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands.\nThese gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for '21. '21 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average.\nOur guidance reflects the following assumptions: Domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to '21 levels and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition or disposition activity.\nFinally, I really want to thank the entire Simon team for their tireless work that they continue to do for our retailers, shoppers and communities every day. And for bouncing back in '21 after a very difficult 2020.\nMake no mistake about it, '21 was a great year. And I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share. So that's a heck of a year. I'm very excited about our plans for '22 and the future growth prospects of our company, and we're ready for any questions.",

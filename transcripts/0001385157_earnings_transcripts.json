[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full year results and outlook for our first quarter of fiscal 2026. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.\nDuring this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.\nNow please note that we are making a change in our non-GAAP reporting with the start of our fiscal 2026 year. The fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 financial results that we will discuss in today's call do not reflect this change. However, beginning in fiscal 2026 we will exclude amortization expense on intangible assets from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures, and this change is reflected in our Q1 guidance. We have recast the financial information of the quarters of 2025 and 2024 to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison of our results going forward and this is provided in the slide appendix and in an 8-K that was filed this morning.\nAlso, as a reminder, we will hold our Investor Day event on November 20 in Philadelphia with the product showcase the evening before. We're excited to convey opportunities for growth and further value creation for our owners and are looking forward to seeing many of you at the event. Note that we will also have a live webcast for those who are unable to attend in person.\nAnd finally, during the Q&A portion of today's call due to the number of participants, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to 1 question and you may rejoin the queue if you have a second question.\nNow let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin\n\nChief Executive Officer and Board Member, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get into the details on the slides, I do want to reinforce a few key takeaways upfront. First off is that our strong momentum is continuing with quarterly and full year records for sales, earnings and free cash flow in what continues to be an uneven macro environment. We also continue to demonstrate the strategic positioning of our portfolio, benefiting from the secular growth trends in a number of our businesses, and we'll talk about these as we go through the discussion of our results today.\nWe also continue to demonstrate operational resilience with our global manufacturing strategy where we've invested heavily to ensure in-region support of our customers and we are set up for the strong performance to continue into fiscal 2026. We expect to continue executing on our long-term value creation model, and we'll click down and provide more details at our Investor Day next month.\nSo with that as a backdrop, I would like to get into the presentation, starting with Slide 3, and I'll discuss fiscal 2025 results and our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Our fourth quarter sales were above our guidance of $4.75 billion, growing 17% on a reported basis and 11% organically year-over-year. Both segments contributed to our sales being above of guidance.\nWe also saw orders increase in both segments to $4.7 billion, and this was an increase of 22% year-over-year and it was up 5% sequentially. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.44. That was above our guidance due to the strong execution by our teams and increased 25% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins were 20%, increasing 130 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, in the quarter, free cash flow performance continued the strong momentum that we've seen throughout the year and was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.\nSo let me transition to full year results. Full year sales were a record at $17.3 billion, growing 9% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic basis. In our Industrial segment, we saw 24% reported growth, benefiting from bolt-on acquisitions that we made this year. On an organic basis, segment growth was 18% and capitalized on the strong demand for artificial intelligence and energy infrastructure applications.\nIn transportation, we continue to demonstrate our strong global position with strength in Asia that drove content growth from increased data connectivity and growth of the electrified powertrain in that region. We achieved record earnings in fiscal 2025. Adjusted operating margins were essentially 20%, expanding 80 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share was $8.76 increasing 16% versus the prior year, driven entirely by the strong sales and margin performance.\nWe continue to demonstrate the strength of our cash generation model. We delivered free cash flow of over $3 billion with conversion levels of well over 100%. This strong cash generation gave us the flexibility for record capital deployment with over $2 billion returned to shareholders and $2.6 billion used for bolt-on acquisitions during the year.\nAs we look forward, order levels support our outlook for double-digit growth in the first quarter. We are expecting our first quarter sales to be $4.5 billion, reflecting sequential seasonality that we typically see and increasing 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 11% organically. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be around $2.53 in the first quarter, and this will represent growth of 23% year-over-year.\nNow if you could turn to Slide 4, let me get into order of details. In the quarter, we saw orders of $4.7 billion, with growth year-over-year and sequentially in both segments. On a year-over-year basis, we saw organic order growth across all regions. And on a sequential basis, growth was driven by automotive, digital data networks and energy.\nTouching on the segment. Transportation orders increased 9% versus the prior year driven by auto growth in all regions. In the Industrial segment, orders increased 39% year-over-year reflecting ongoing momentum in DDN as well as our energy and AD&M businesses. Also one thing to highlight in our order is we did see order rates improve in the general industrial end markets. and we believe this indicates stability.\nNow let me get into the segment quarterly results. And if you could turn to Slide 5, I'll start with transportation. Our auto sales grew 2% organically in the fourth quarter with growth in Asia of 11% being offset by declines in Western regions of 4%. Our growth over market reflects the ongoing regional dynamics that we've seen all year and have impacted our growth over market.\nAs we look forward, we expect global auto production to be 87 million to 88 million units in fiscal 2026 with content growth being driven by key wins for our leading-edge products and technology around data connectivity and electrification of the powertrain. We continue to benefit from our strong global position and localization strategy, which enables us to serve our global customer base.\nTurning to Commercial Transportation. We reported 5% organic growth, and this was driven entirely by growth in Europe and in Asia which was offset by ongoing weakness that we see in North America. And in our Sensors business, we saw weakness in end markets in Western regions that were partially offset by growth in Asia. For the Transportation segment, the team delivered 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year as we expected, and the team did a good job of navigating an uneven global production environment.\nSo if you could, let me turn to Industrial Solutions segment, which is on Slide 6. And the segment grew 34% in the quarter overall as well as 24% organically. Digital Data Networks had another outstanding quarter, where the business grew 80% year-over-year. We continue to benefit from increasing ramps from hyperscaler platforms and for the full year, we generated over $900 million in AI revenue, tripling our AI sales versus the prior year, and this reflects our increased momentum.\nIn our Automation and Connected Living business, sales grew 11% organically year-over-year with 3% sequential improvement that we believe reflect stability in general industrial markets. In our Energy business, sales grew 83% and included the Richards acquisition, which enables us to capitalize on strong growth opportunities in the North American utility market. On an organic basis, our sales increased a strong 24% driven by continued increased investments by our customers and grid hardening as well as renewable applications.\nIn our Aerospace, Defense and Marine business, sales grew 7% organically, driven by growth across commercial aerospace as well as defense applications. And in these markets, we continue to see favorable demand trends coupled with ongoing supply chain improvement. And in our medical business, sales were roughly flat sequentially as we expected.\nTurning to margins for the Industrial segment. Our adjusted operating margins expanded by nearly 300 basis points to over 20%, driven by the strong operational performance and benefits of higher volume. I am pleased with the progress our team has made this year, supporting the strong growth that we have in this segment.\nNow let me turn it over to Heath to get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward.\n\nHeath A. Mitts\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $943 million with an adjusted operating margin of approximately 20%. GAAP operating income was $916 million and included $10 million of acquisition-related charges and $17 million of restructuring and other charges.\nFor the full year 2025, fiscal -- I'm sorry, for the fiscal '25, restructuring charges were $113 million, and I expect restructuring charges in fiscal '26 to be roughly at the $100 million level. Adjusted EPS was $2.44 and GAAP EPS was $2.23 for the quarter and included a tax charge of $0.10 related primarily to the increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Additionally, we had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.11. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4% in our fourth quarter and approximately 23% for the full year 2025.\nMoving to fiscal '26. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter to be approximately 22%, with the full year being similar to last year at approximately 23%. And importantly, as always, we anticipate our cash tax rate to be well below our adjusted ETR.\nNow if you can turn to Slide 8 for fiscal '25 performance. We set records in sales, operating -- adjusted operating margins, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Relative to our business model, we are delivering on our targets for sales growth, margin performance, EPS growth and cash generation. Sales of $17.3 billion were up 9% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic basis year-over-year, with both organic and inorganic growth driven by our Industrial segment.\nAdjusted operating margins were essentially 20% for fiscal '25 with margin expansion of 80 basis points year-over-year driven by strong operational performance. Both of our segments are running at the 20% level for adjusted operating margins, we would expect further margin expansion as volumes continue to grow. Adjusted earnings per share were $8.76, up 16% year-over-year, driven by sales growth and margin expansion.\nNow turning to cash. We increased our free cash flow to $3.2 billion in fiscal '25, which was up 14% or $400 million year-over-year. Our free cash flow reflects 100% -- over 100% conversion to adjusted net income, and we remain committed to this going forward. And keep in mind that our strong cash flow generation and cash conversion in fiscal '25 also included us investing a couple of hundred million of increased capital investments to support the growth in our industrial segment. So a very good story there.\nIn fiscal '25, we returned roughly $2.2 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, and we deployed approximately $2.6 billion, aligned with our bolt-on acquisition strategy. Our cash generation and healthy balance sheet gives us continued optionality with uses of capital to support investments for future growth, both organically and through M&A.\nNow as Sujal mentioned earlier, we are making a change to our non-GAAP reporting and going forward and beginning with the first quarter of fiscal '26, we will exclude intangible amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measures and this change is reflected in our Q1 guidance. You will see the historical impact of the recast materials that we have provided for fiscal '25 and fiscal '24 in the appendix of our materials. And you can assume that amortization impact will be roughly $0.15 per quarter for fiscal '26.\nNow before I turn it over to questions, let me reinforce that we continue to execute well in both segments to deliver the record results you see for fiscal '25. We have positioned the company to deliver strong performance and value for our owners, and we expect our momentum to continue into fiscal '26 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities and our value creation model at our upcoming Investor Day on November 20.\nNow let's open it up for questions.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Heath. Kate, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?"

    "content": "Q3 2025 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nQ3 2025 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nTELOSLOOCT 29, 4:00 AM\n\nFrank Maaø\n\nAnalyst, DNB Markets, Research Division\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Telenor's Q3 results call. I'm Frank Maao, Head of Investor Relations here at Telenor. And presenting today are our CEO, Benedicte Schilbred Fasmer here; and our CFO, Torbjorn Wist. Before we get started, just a few quick notes. So unless we say otherwise, all growth rates are organic and made on a constant currency basis. And when we mention EBITDA, we are referring to adjusted EBITDA. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Benedicte.\n\nBenedicte Schilbred Fasmer\n\nCEO, SpareBank 1 SR-Bank ASA\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we've seen a challenging external environment. Hybrid warfare, extreme weather and a high level of cyber threats have all impacted power and communications. And these events are a reminder of how crucial robust digital infrastructure is. And at the same time, they give us opportunities to help customers build resilience, thanks to our strong network and technology foundation. .\nToday, we are reporting another solid quarter, mainly driven by strong results in the Nordics. Our commercial strategy and ongoing transformation efforts continue to pay off with EBITDA in the Nordics, up 8% and 50,000 new mobile customers added. In Asia, however, we do see a bit of a more mixed picture.\nOn one hand, we grew service revenues and EBITDA by 4%, with positive contributions from both Pakistan and Grameenphone in Bangladesh. On the other hand, we continue to expect challenges in the region as Torbjorn will get back to and including the macro economy and headwinds tied to the cost of supporting data growth, including Spectrum.\nThanks to the dedication of our employees across the group, we have delivered an EBITDA growth of 5.4% and a free cash flow before M&A of NOK 4.2 billion this quarter. And this represents a 50% year-on-year increase due to higher EBITDA, prudent CapEx and supportive working capital management.\nAnd with 3 quarters now behind us, we are reaffirming our expected performance for 2025, and we are tightening our guidance ranges. So let me walk you through the key developments in the Nordics and Asia before Torbjorn takes you through the financials in more detail.\nThe Nordics continued to deliver strong results with momentum across all business units. Organic service revenues in the Nordics rose 2.1% as OpEx declined by the same percentage year-over-year, driving the 8% increase in EBITDA. Breaking it down, gross profit improved, supported by upselling pricing, product mix and increased wholesale revenues.\nOngoing transformation programs helped lower OpEx and even as we spend -- even though we spent more on sales, marketing and business resilience. And again, Norway remained our top performer with 2.3% service revenue growth and 9.2% EBITDA growth. And that was also supported by the national roaming agreement announced last year.\nIn Sweden, top line growth was flat due to our fixed transformation initiative, but EBITDA grew 7.5%, thanks to improved gross margins and OpEx efficiencies, especially in customer service. We made good progress in the mass market mobile segment, increasing both ARPU and our customer base, though the enterprise segment in Sweden remained very challenging.\nIn Finland, DNA grew service revenues by 2% year-over-year. This was supported by net additions of 28,000 mobile customers and 3,000 fixed customers during the quarter. For this quarter, DNA grew EBITDA by 5% and quite a bit more on an underlying basis. Denmark delivered 5% growth powered by strong mobile and fixed wireless access. EBITDA was up 4% despite strategic challenge shifts and a huge transformation effort.\nOverall, the Nordics delivered a strong performance. In Asia, we continue to make operational progress despite a tough external backdrop. Grameenphone delivered growth in both service revenues and EBITDA, though the upswing was softer than hoped. The macro context is still fragile and data price competition is intense.\nDuring my recent trip there, I could genuinely feel a sense of optimism building up among the people as the election approaches early next year. Telenor Pakistan delivered 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth, which is actually great to see. Nevertheless, a key milestone for us was the competition authority approval for the sale to PTCL. We are now awaiting the last approvals and aiming to close the transaction during the next few months.\nIn Malaysia, we recognized NOK 0.5 billion adjustment to our share of Celcom's Digi's second quarter results. This was due to the financial profile of its associated 5G network company, DNB. And Torbjorn will cover that in more detail. In Thailand, True continued to improve profitability and reduce leverage in Q2.\nNext week, a first-ever interim dividend is expected to be proposed with payment in Q4. On October 1, we announced a strategic procurement partnership with Vodafone. And this collaboration brings together the scale and expertise of 2 global leaders serving over 550 million customers across 23 markets.\nAnd by combining the strength of our 2 organizations and an annual spend of altogether NOK 300 billion, we can unlock significant value within sourcing. As we gradually phase this in towards the latter part of this decade, we expect this partnership to provide meaningful value creation.\nAnd for Telenor, this translates into enhanced competitiveness and improved cost efficiency. It also strengthens our attractiveness to suppliers and partners while bolstering supply chain resilience. A very critical capability in today's evolving geopolitical and technological environment.\nThe partnership is also grounded in a shared sustainability commitment, reinforcing our leadership in responsible sourcing and business practices. Ultimately, this partnership is creating long-term value for both our customers and shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll hand you over to Torbjorn for more on the financials. Here you go, Torbjorn.\n\nTorbjorn Mogard Wist\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Benedicte, and good morning, everyone. Let's dive straight into the Q3 financial highlights. Group service revenues in the quarter reached NOK 16.3 billion, which is up 2.7% year-on-year. The adjusted EBITDA was NOK 9.5 billion, up 5.4%, mainly driven by the strong 8% EBITDA growth in the Nordics.\nIn Q3, adjusted EPS was NOK 1.85, down 3% from last year, mainly due to the NOK 0.5 billion accounting adjustment for Celcom Digi that Benedicte mentioned in her remarks. Without this adjustment, the EPS growth would have been 18%. Now we generated a solid free cash flow before M&A of NOK 4.2 billion during the quarter, which is up 50% year-on-year on the back of our EBITDA growth and slightly reduced CapEx.\nThe group CapEx to sales ratio was 13.3%, 0.7 percentage points lower than in the same period last year. The leverage ratio ended up at 2.3x within our target range, and this was supported by both the free cash flow profile as well as slightly favorable end of quarter currency movements as the Norwegian kroner strengthened against pretty much all our currencies.\nAs previously stated, driving return on capital employed over time remains a top priority for us. Return on capital employed came in at 8.6% for the last 12 months, up 0.6 percentage points from last year. If you exclude all our noncontrolled companies, the group return on capital employed would have been close to 14%.\nLet's zoom in then on the top line. The group service revenue growth of 2.7% year-on-year remain constrained by weak macroeconomic conditions in Bangladesh. The Nordics were the main contributor to group growth with service revenues up 2.1%. If you exclude the NOK 56 million adjustment to the first half service revenues in DNA, underlying growth for the Nordics would have been 2.6%. Nordic Mobile service revenue growth of 3.2% was mainly driven by Norway, Denmark as well as DNA in Finland.\nPakistan continued its strong momentum and Grameenphone contributed positively for the first time since the second quarter of 2024. If we turn to OpEx, Telenor Nordics delivered a solid reduction in OpEx in the third quarter, declining 2.1% year-over-year, driven by lower personnel costs and a successful transformation activities with Sweden standing out as a key contributor.\nFTEs across the region were reduced by 3%. Denmark saw higher OpEx largely attributed to the higher commissions in recent quarters as well as higher costs linked to its ongoing and important IT transformation effort, while Finland benefited from lower personnel costs and positive effects from a minor reclassification.\nOverall, the rise in sales and marketing expenses was driven by amortization of subscriber costs. For the Nordics, this resulted in a 5% year-over-year increase in sales and marketing spend. OpEx in Asia rose 3.7% year-on-year, mainly due to higher O&M costs as well as personnel costs in Grameenphone as well as Telenor Pakistan. Amp recorded a 21% increase in OpEx, reflecting growth initiatives as well as the transfer of 2 businesses from Telenor Norway, as we mentioned in Q2.\nOverall, there was a modest uptick of 1.3% in group OpEx in the third quarter, underscoring our progress of transformation activities, cost discipline. Then turning to EBITDA. EBITDA for the group was up 5.4% in Q3. Asia contributed positively, partly offset by group effects similar to the ones we have discussed before.\nBut the main driver this quarter was the performance in the Nordics. And in this business area, EBITDA grew 8% in Q3. And as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, Telenor Norway was the cornerstone this quarter. The performance in Norway was driven by service revenue growth as well as wholesale revenues, mainly from the national roaming agreement highlighted during our Q2 presentation.\nOn a side note, we still forecast the full year revenues from this contract to be more than NOK 0.5 billion for 2025 as a whole. Together, these factors paid way for a 9.2% year-on-year growth for Norway.\nNow DNA also had a reported EBITDA increase of 5% despite booking of catch-up items. And this was driven by strong gross profit. Sweden reported an EBITDA growth of 7.5%, supported by growing gross profit and a solid OpEx decline. So with that, let me move to Asia. Our 2 consolidated companies in Asia delivered service revenues of NOK 4.3 billion and EBITDA of NOK 2.5 billion, representing organic growth of more than 4% for both metrics.\nThis was mainly driven by Telenor Pakistan's continued EBITDA growth, supported by ARPU uplift and lower energy costs. Grameenphone returned to growth in both top line and EBITDA, which is good to see, though the upswing was softer than hoped despite the easier comparables due to the impact of the regime change we saw in Bangladesh in Q3 last year.\nAs you know, the market is gradually transitioning from voice to data, which is challenging as competition in data is quite intense. Grameenphone has had subdued 4G investments with CapEx to sales of 9% over the past 4 quarters due to the macro situation. But given the data demand from our customers, we will eventually need to dial this up a bit again, to accommodate for expanded data coverage.\nAmong our associates, True reported 2.6% year-on-year EBITDA growth for its second quarter and continued its deleveraging profile. The company nudged down its full year outlook following a network outage as well as some of the macro headwinds. True has stated plans to propose an interim dividend in conjunction with its Q3 reporting, which is due already next week.\nIn the quarter, we received NOK 350 million in dividends from Celcom Digi as the company increased its dividend per share while also reporting 5G traffic costs. Taken together, Asia's profitability improved during Q3 despite the relatively challenging external backdrop. However, we do see some short to midterm risks and headwinds in Asia. Among the risks we see, we have touched on in the past, I would like to highlight 3 that will affect us.\nFirst, in Malaysia, the 5G landscape remains challenging. Celcom Digi's associated company, originally a 5G network for all telcos is undergoing the final stages of privatization. Its recently reported financials suggest a lack of sustainable long-term financial situation in this associated company. We're working with partners to support a restructuring with the aim of helping Celcom Digi ensure a competitive 5G company setup. However, the outcome of this process remains to be seen.\nThe financial profile of the 5G NetCo is also the backdrop for the NOK 530 million adjustment to our share of results from Celcom Digi this quarter, as mentioned earlier. This quarter, we have only 1 year left until a major chunk of our spectrum in Bangladesh needs to be removed. This will entail a step-up in spectrum payments for up to 4 renewed licenses as these spectrum licenses were paid 4 years ago.\nAs always, our spectrum resources web page on telenor.com gives you full details on our spectrum portfolio. In addition, spectrum pricing in the country has historically been 2x the global median despite a much lower GDP per capita in the country, as you can see in the graph in the middle of the page.\nWe're hoping, finally, competition authority clearance was recently granted for -- to PTCL for the takeover of Telenor Pakistan. Very pleased to see that. We're hoping for a smooth process from here onwards and look forward to closing the transaction soon. Given the recent strong performance, we expect Telenor Pakistan to contribute around NOK 0.5 billion in free cash flow for '25. And note, of course, that this contribution will end once this sale is complete.\nThen moving back up to the group level and let's look at the P&L, cash flows and leverage. There are 3 items in the P&L this quarter that I would like to highlight. First, we have the adjustment we made related to Celcom Digi mentioned earlier. This reduces our share of net income from associated companies.\nSecond, we booked a NOK 269 million reversal of impairment of our shares in True. Note that, as we said in Q2, all of our shares in True are now directly owned. Finally, on income tax, we booked a NOK 312 million provision for withholding tax on retained earnings in associated companies.\nThis is the main reason why the effective tax rate increased to 33% from 26% in Q3 last year. All in all, we generated net income to equity holders of NOK 3 billion in Q3 and an adjusted EPS of NOK 1.85 per share. Moving to free cash flows. The free cash flow in Q3 was driven by the strong operational performance in the Nordics.\nWe paid almost NOK 1 billion in income taxes, of which 70% is in Grameenphone. As we have discussed before, we have seasonally lower interest payments in Q1 and Q3. And as usual, spectrum payments are very small in Q3. Net working capital contributed negatively by NOK 0.3 billion, mainly due to high activity in Norway and increased receivables.\nCapEx paid amounted to NOK 2.6 billion, in line with the quarter's CapEx booked. Other lease payments amounted to a total of NOK 1 billion, a figure slightly below the indicated average for the year. As Grameenphone and Telenor Fiber streamed up interim dividends, we also paid out a total of NOK 600 million to noncontrolling shareholders.\nOn a side note, around NOK 1.1 billion of the Q3 Grameenphone NCI was staggered and is due for payment in Q4. Altogether, this led to the free cash flow coming in at NOK 4.2 billion, a solid 50% increase year-on-year. Then moving to the debt side. Net interest paid debt, excluding license obligations ended the quarter at NOK 85 billion, which is down NOK 5.2 billion quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from a NOK 1.1 billion FX gain as the kroner strengthened against all our key debt currencies.\nAt the end of the quarter, leverage stood at 2.3% within our 1.8% to 2.3% target range. We maintain a resilient balance sheet and prudent maturity profile and our dividend policy ensures predictable shareholder remuneration. Then let's move to our outlook update.\nHeading into Q4 and our upcoming Capital Markets Day on November 11, our full year '25 outlook pillars remain unchanged. We're tightening the ranges based on our solid year-to-date execution and our visibility for the year. For the Nordics, we see 2% to 3% service revenue growth, 8% to 9% EBITDA growth and CapEx to sales is confirmed around 14%.\nAs we stated in Q2 on the decimal side, the CapEx number is more likely than not going to be somewhat on the north side of 14% considering the investments we announced earlier this year with regards to resilience and fiber in Finland. For the group, outlook for adjusted EBITDA growth is tightened to 5% to 6% from mid-single digit previously.\nWe maintain our view of around NOK 13 billion free cash flow before M&A. We believe that the contribution from Asia will probably be a bit less than the third. All in all, the updated outlook reaffirm our overall traction for the full year. And with this Benedicte, I believe it is time to wrap it all up.\n\nBenedicte Schilbred Fasmer\n\nCEO, SpareBank 1 SR-Bank ASA\n\nThank you so much, Torbjorn. And to sum up, in the third quarter, we delivered consistent execution, strong performance in the Nordics, improving profitability in Asia and a robust cash flow. We also highlighted some expected headwinds in Asia. We are focused on customer experience, service, reliability and security and with transformation being key for both efficiency and future growth for us.\nOur financial principles emphasize return on capital, balance sheet strength and a predictable dividend trajectory. We achieved these results thanks to the ongoing commitment and relentless drive of our great people across Telenor. The updated '25 outlook reaffirms our overall traction, and we are tightening the ranges and maintaining the free cash flow outlook. One final note. We are excited to remind you about our upcoming Capital Markets Day on the 11th of November. We look look forward to welcoming you here at our Fornebu office. And please do not forget to register your attendance, whether you'll be just joining us in person or virtually. So with that, thank you all for your attention and continued support. We are now ready to take your questions."

I'm Jinggay Nograles, Head of Investor Relations here at PLDT, and it's my pleasure to welcome the first half financial and operating results briefing.\nJoining us today to share insights into PLDT's performance and strategic direction are PLDT Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Butch Jimenez; PLDT Financial Officer, Mr. Danny Yu; PLDT Corporate Secretary, Marilyn Victorino Aquino; PLDT Chief Legal Counsel, Attorney Joan De Venecia-Fabul; PLDT Head of Consumer Home, Mr. John Palanca; PLDT Head of Enterprise, Blums Pineda; PLDT President, Biboy ViBone; and PLDT Treasurer, Leo Posadas. Later, during the call, we will also be joined by Smart Communications Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Boy Martirez. Go ahead Danny.\n\nDanny Y. Yu\n\nSenior VP & PLDT Group Controller\n\nYes. Good afternoon everyone. Allow me to present PLDT's first half 2025 performance covering key results and business highlights. Our service revenues, net of interconnection costs reached PHP 97.1 billion. Our service revenues, net of interconnection costs reached PHP 97.1 billion, a touch higher year-on-year. EBITDA came in at PHP 55.5 billion, up 3% a year. EBITDA margin remained steady at 52%. This was supported by steady growth from our fiber and disciplined cost management. Cash OpEx subsidies provisions reflecting continued spending discipline.\nTelco Core income down 4% due to higher depreciation and financing costs as investment in our network in infra to improve quality of service. Core income, on the other hand, reached PHP 17.6 billion, up 1% lifted by Maya earnings. PLDT share in Maya's core earnings amounted to PHP 406 million in the first half, its first profitable semester marking a PHP 1.1 million turnaround from the PHP 693 million. This strong result reflects continued growth in deposits, payments volumes. In summary, we delivered stable results managdriven by careful cost management and ongoing revenue growth in key areas.\nPLDT service revenues remains stable, driven by sustained demand across 3 segments: mobile data, fiber, corporate data and ICT. Starting with Home, revenues grew 4% year-on-year, reaching PHP 30.4 billion, led by strong steady fiber demand. Enterprise was slightly lower PHP 23.5 billion, down 1% due to continued declines in legacy businesses. Positively, corporate data and ICT revenues held steady despite last year's closure of Connectivity. Within these segments, I stands out growing 15% year-on-year to PHP 3.2 billion. While our connectivity business is in transition, we continue to build a pipeline of new opportunities powered by emerging at insurance.\nTurning to individuals, revenues totaled PHP 42.3 billion, slightly down in part due to weaker legacy offerings, more on international to PHP 37.4 million now making up 89% of the segment's revenues, which remain encouraged with the robust reduction of 5G and the continued increase in data usage supporting future growth and better [indiscernible] Overall, mobile data and fiber and corporate data ICP now represent 90% of our total revenues versus 88% last year, more than offsetting legacy declines. Excluding legacy services, total net service revenues rose by 3%. Now let's take a closer look at the home segment. Home revenues grew 4% year-on-year to PHP 13.4 million strong fiber demand. Fiber revenues reached PHP 29.5 billion, up 7% versus last year and now weak up 92% of total home revenues Subscriber momentum remains strong with 169,000 net fibers in the first half, over 3x higher than last year's 50,000 net tons. This growth reflects the impact of our accelerated portal program.\nWe continue to lead in ARPU [indiscernible] . ARPU was steady at 1,485 for the semester the highest in the industry. Churn improved quarter-on-quarter, a testament to network reliability and brand strength. Our bank offerings also continue to resonate while over 80% of new subscribers opted for higher [indiscernible] in 1,299 and above. These integrated broadband mobile and content bundles help drive customer stickiness and support revenues. Enterprise revenues for have reached PHP 23.5 billion, slightly down by 1% from last year, due to non headwinds. This includes the full impact of loss Pogo connectivity as well as lower public sector deal closures, tied to domain elections and leadership changes in government agencies. We expect these delayed awards to be booked in the second half.\nCorporate data and ICT remained stable at PHP 17.4 billion and now account for 74% of enterprise revenues ICT continues to be a bright spot with segment revenues up 15% year-on-year. Data center colocation grew by 36% while cybersecurity services expanded by 24%. Other growth areas include fiber, up 4% year-on-year SD1 up 19% as demand for secured flexible enterprise connectivity continues to rise. We also saw meaningful structure from Asia Direct Cable, which supported high bundle deal closures with hyperscalers and carriers in the second quarter. While connectivity revenues are in transitional phase, our broader enterprise business remains resilient, supported by advanced digital solutions and a growing customer pipeline.\nIn April, PLDT through its data center [indiscernible] inaugurated Vitro Sanders, the country's first operational AI-ready hyperscale facility and the largest in our portfolio. This rate certified mega facility delivers 50 megawatts of power capacity and houses over 4,500 drugs built to meet the stringent requirements of enterprises hyperscalers, the public sector and AI workloads. The facility now both live and media GPUs powering EPDs AI solutions giving Philippine enterprises across to on-demand, high-performance AI computing without the heavy capital cost of building their own infra. As the country was to AI enabler Digital offers no latency and the building scale is needed for enterprise to innovate on compete. Vitro continues to deliver strong growth with collocations revenues up 36% in the first half, driven by a 19% increase in rough deployments across our data center network.\nWith Vitro Santa Rosa and our broader ecosystem, PLDT is building the intra backbone to position the Plus original hub for digital services and AI innovation. Individual revenues reached PHP 42.3 billion for the first half, down 1% from last year, reflecting continued drag from legacy services and a softer second quarter. Mobile data revenues were PHP 37.4 billion, making up 89% of the segment, while Q2 was slightly slower, we continue to see healthy data usage and stickiness from our customer base. ARPU have remained broadly stable despite competitive pressures, thanks to our hyperpersonalized offers that match customer needs while helping us manage marketing costs more efficiently. Total mobile data traffic grew 5% year-on-year to 2,766 petabytes supported by the continued drive in 5G adoption. 5G traffic surged 84% versus last year and 5G large devices now make up 17% of our base up from 11% a year ago. This reflects network improvements and the impact of affordable 5G device offers.\nAnother bright spot is fixed wireless. With the introduction of our new 5G model, we saw revenues from the segment growing 12% year-on-year, driven by the strength and reliability of our 5G network especially in areas where fiber is not yet available. We remain focused on giving customers the best experience not only in network quality, but also in how we design products, not [indiscernible] preferences and needs. This approach allows us to maintain ARPU spur demand and increase loyal innovations remain a key lever as we took shape the next phase of growth. We hear more about our latest digital initiatives targeting younger Filipinos I'd like to turn over to our Smart CEO, Mr. Boy Martirez .\n\nAnastacio R. Martirez\n\nAfter [indiscernible] by our internal teams and technology partners, it is my pleasure to present to you the first series of innovations that we have embarked on mobile service called KIQ. KIQ is the Philippines first and only app-based mobile service that offers a personalized digital telco shares. KIQ is also one of the first in the world to offer such groundbreaking experience in is our old to the dense market. The GenZ between 19 to 20 years old is this young generation of redefining audit, share and stable equity. They are disruptors and we've seen their influence and powering the results of our latest Philippine elections. The revenues yet authentic nature, their ability to know exactly when to swipe left or to double that pick up a generation of network is predominant control.\nWith this in mind, we have built a mobile experience that kids GenZ complete freedom and flexibility to personalize and control their mobile jury on their own terms. We looking up, users can build their own plan, choose their own data allocation, choose their calitinclusions, choose their numbers due to their policy period and more unlocking a very personalized experience for Genesis. It's my pride to show you our television commercial that was launched last Sunday.\n[Presentation]\nThank you. There will be more innovations that we will be introducing. In fact, the KIQ hasn't even dried up on this innovation that we launched last Sunday, we'll be launching another 1 this coming Monday. So stay tuned.\n\nDanny Y. Yu\n\nSenior VP & PLDT Group Controller\n\nThanks, Boy. As we continue to innovate on the product side, we're also staying focused on disciplined cost management. Now let me walk you through our operating expenses. Total cash of subsidies and provisions for the first half came in at PHP 41.6 billion, down PHP 1.4 billion or 3% from the same period last year. breaking it down, compensation and benefits, excluding MRP, declined by PHP 900 million or 8%, helped by ongoing rightsizing airports. Selling and promotions were down 22%, reflecting better campaign targeting and improved spend efficiency. Subsidies fell 21%, mainly due to lower device issuance and better control on subsidy per unit. On the other hand, repays and mantras rose by 4% to PHP 15.6 billion driven by network expansion and new site rollouts.\nOverall, the 3% year-on-year reduction in cash operating expenses highlights our ongoing efforts to optimize spend while ensuring support for growth areas like fiber, mobile data, enterprise ICT and digital innovations. For the first half consolidated EBITDA reached PHP 55.5 billion, up 3% year-on-year, despite flattish top line growth and [indiscernible] This reflects the resilience of our business model with earnings supported by a stronger mix of fiber, ICT and personalized mobile offers. This growth was driven mainly by lower OpEx with total cash OpEx down by PHP 1.4 billion or 3% year-on-year. Our EBITDA margin held steady at 52%, underscoring our ability to defend profitability in a competitive market. This stability gives us a strong platform heading into the second half, where we expect additional upside from enterprise deal closures and traction from new product launches.\nTelco Core income for the first half came in at PHP 17.2 million, slightly lower year-on-year as higher depreciation and financing costs weighing on the results. That said, a clear bright spot is Maya, which delivered PHP 406 million in core income. -- its first profitable semester and a meaningful turnaround from a loss last year. Maya has now cemented its position as the largest digital bank and merchant acquirer in the country. It's gamified, all in one ecosystem continues to attract, retain, grow users, creating a profitable and sustainable financial platform that is now materially contributing to PLDT's core income now and moving forward. Including Maya's contribution, consolidated core income rose to PHP 17.6 billion, up 1% versus the same period last year. Reported income was slightly over at PHP 18.1 billion. mainly reflecting lower net ForEx and derivative gains. We'll share more on Maya's performance and growth momentum in a dedicated section later in this presentation.\nNow let's move on to CapEx and our debt profile. CapEx for the first half of 2025 stood at PHP 27.4 billion. We're now guiding full year CapEx of about PHP 63 billion, lower than our original guidance of PHP 68 billion to PHP 73 billion. This reduction is not due to scaling back our airports, but rather the result of more favorable pricing and negotiated terms with vendors and suppliers. We remain focused on network quality and expansion with continued momentum in new site rollouts, LTE and 5G upgrades, fiber port builds and investment in submarine cables and AI in [indiscernible] . We're also investing in AI ready data center and upgrades that improve service quality and long-term efficiency. CapEx intensity for the first half declined 26% and in line with our plan to bring down the ratio down and support stronger free cash flow.\nAs of end of June, our net debt stood at PHP 282.6 billion, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.57x. Our interest cover remains salty at 3.52x giving us ample had to manage that service. We have continued to manage maturities proactively with 55% of our debt maturing beyond 2030 and only 5% maturing in 2025. U.S. dollar-denominated debt is modest at 13% with only 5% unhedged. Our overall debt portfolio remains diversified with a balanced mix of fixed and floating rates and an average tenor of 6.4 years. We remain investment grade rated by both S&P and Moody's, underscoring confidence in our fundamentals and risk profile. We maintain our guidance of returning to positive free cash flow by 2026 and are working toward our target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x over a medium term.\nThe Board declared an interim cash dividend of PHP 0.48 per share earlier today in line with our regular payout policy of 60% of Telco Core income. This corresponds to a Telco Core earnings per share of PHP 80 for the first half and reflects our commitment to stay or shareholders' return while managing leverage. Based on PRB disclosing share price as of June 30, the 12-month trailing yield stands at about 8%. Now let me discuss Maya, the film tech, rather the #1 fintech ecosystem in the Philippines, comprising of Maya, the leading digital bank and Maya Philippies, the top omnichannel payment processor. What makes Maya unique? It is a fully integrated platform that unites digital payments marketing and lending for both consumers and businesses. This creates a powerful flywheel more users drive more transaction generating richer insights enabling better product adoption and ultimately delivering scale and profitability.\nThese strong network effects are firmly established across both consumer and business segments. Next, Maya remains the Philippines #1 digital bank and leading payment profits [indiscernible] and QR merchant payments. As of June 2025, Maya had 8.2 million customers, 2.1 million borrowers, PHP 50.4 billion in deposit and PHP 150 billion in total loss dispersed sales. In 4Q of 2025, Maya posted its second consecutive quarter of sustainable profitability with PHP 582 million in net income a growth of 60% over the first quarter of 2025. Now let me now break down Maya's bank performance. Maya's deposit close to PHP 5.4 billion by end of June, up 54% year-on-year, showing sustained growth and stronger customer trust. Loan disbursement kept PHP 32 billion in Q2, up 147% year-on-year, bringing total life to date this [indiscernible] PHP 152 billion across consumer loans MSME loans and partner at loan channeled. Outstanding loans grew to PHP 25 billion, raising LDR to 49% and boosting net interest margin to 20.2%. NPL inched up to 5.2% with new products and services but these remain healthy.\nMaya also expected to stop this as the portfolio matures. In summary, Maya is unlocking the full value of its platform by linking consumer and merchant ecosystems. Maya recently launched the Myer Black credit card, a premium lifestyle card and the Maya Black preferred rewire program, leaving third holders after 10 x rewards within the ecosystem. Maya remains the only digital market of Philippines issuing credit clients with over 230,000 issued since August 2024 mainly to first-time users. Maya is also expanding credit access to partners like Pepsi, [indiscernible] Juanhand. In a sport strategic in such as the London co-branded card and Pulse mobile integration with its ecosystem firing all cylinders, Maya setting the base for a future of digital finance in the Philippines.\nNow allow me to cite a few sustainability highlights during the quarter. PLDT and Smart sign agreements with Empower to source additional renewable energy for operations. This will result not only in cost savings but also support our decarbonization road map. PLDT's progress in the area of sustainabilities manifested in several recognitions. PLDT was again included in the FTSE4Good Index where our score was higher than the telecom industry the mover sum center and country coverages. It's PHP 2 billion social loan was cited as the social infra deal of the year by the asset in 2025 in the Asian region category. During the quarter, PLDT submission submitted its communication on progress, which affirmed its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact the principles on human rights labor, environment and anticorruption. The PLDT team was named the overall winner of the UNGC innovation accelerator for young professionals and will be the filing submission to the UNGC Leaders Summit in New York on September.\nMore details of our initiatives can be found in the Sustainability section of this presentation. Now that concludes our prepared remarks for the first half of 2025, we appreciate your continued interest and support, and you would be happy to open the floor for your questions. Thank you."

I'm Frank Maaø, Head of Investor Relations. And today, I'm happy to introduce our new Group CEO, Benedicte Fasmer; and our new group CFO, Torbjorn Wist.\nWe have quite a bit of ground to cover today along the same lines as usual, but with some additional color on the first impressions and priorities of Benedicte and Torbjorn.\nBefore we kick off, a couple of housekeeping items. So as always, in the presentation today, all numbers are in Norwegian kroner, and growth rates are referred to on an organic like-for-like currency basis. And for those who wish to ask questions in our video Q&A after our prepared remarks, please turn on your camera, and please limit just have to 1 question and a related follow-up.\nWith that, I'd like to hand over to you, Benedicte.\n\nBenedicte Schilbred Fasmer\n\nCEO, SpareBank 1 SR-Bank ASA\n\nThank you so much, Frank. Good morning, and thank you so much for tuning into our call. I've been the CEO in Telenor for altogether 9 weeks. And as new to Telenor, I bring perspectives and experiences from my background in other industries, including banking, capital markets, and the fast-moving consumer goods industry. I'm also very fortunate to have a broad experience from Boards as well as being a CEO for the last 4 years.\nA common thread has been a passion for working with technology and people to transform and improve customer experiences and drive results. And my top priority is our customers. And from the picture on this slide, you can see me engaging with customers on the very first day at work in Telenor. I have a very strong commitment to shareholder remuneration, but also capital management. And I can assure you that return on capital will be front and center in capital allocation decisions.\nIn getting to know Telenor, one of the things that have impressed me the most is the quality and the competence of the people. The execution culture, our strong commitment to excellence in secured connectivity as well as our long and proud history. And this has left me with very high expectations for the time ahead. And I'm looking forward to work with my new colleagues to chase further potential in monetizing pockets of growth and transforming customer experiences.\nSo let's take a look at our key priorities for 2025. Since the Capital Markets Day 2.5 years ago, we have made good progress in executing on our strategy. And this team -- this year, sorry, my team and I will have two main tasks. The execution on 2025 as the final year of our current strategy, whilst making sure we evolve our strategy for the years ahead. And we will get back to you on the outcome of this process at the Capital Markets Day in Q4.\nIn terms of the execution priority, I recently finalized the composition of the group management team, which now has executive with long tenor from the company as well experienced from the telecoms industry and other sectors. And in 2025, we will continue to pursue the value creation strategies that are adapted to the characteristics of each of our four business areas.\nFirst and foremost, we are a leading connectivity provider in the Nordics. And here, it would be key to continue in implementing our more-for-more monetization strategy and transformation program. We also have assets in Asia that are important for our cash flow generation and medium-term earnings growth profile. And we will continue to pursue growth and profitability in Grameenphone. We will also continue to work as active owners alongside our partners in our associated companies True and Celcom Digi to nurture growth in order to continue to take out synergies and increase dividend flows.\nOn top of that, we have key assets and ambitions for our infrastructure and Amp areas, each of which have their own distinct value creation strategies. We will continue to evaluate any good inorganic opportunities that may arise across all four of these business areas with a view to creating shareholder return over time.\nAnd with that introduction, let's take a closer look at the quarter. In Q4, we saw a solid performance across our businesses, even though the headline numbers were somewhat negatively affected by a few one-offs as well as the macro development in Bangladesh, which unfortunately continued to weigh on our group results. In the quarter with fairly brisk competition and low inflation in the Nordics, we did quite well, both in terms of service revenue growth and EBITDA. Our Nordic transformation efforts were paramount to an EBITDA growth of 6%.\nIn Asia, our team in Bangladesh has shown tremendous resilience and despite difficult macro conditions. We also saw impressive performance by our business in Pakistan and continue to receive progressive dividends from Celcom Digi. Our free cash flow was once again even stronger than we had hoped for. The total free cash flow including M&A of NOK 13.3 billion in 2024 exceeded the proposed dividend payments for the year.\nThe progress on our ESG agenda was also very solid in 2024, and our commitment to sustainability remains strong. We made significant strides in reducing of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the share of spending covered by science-based targets.\nSo let me now turn to give you a quick operational update for our Nordics area and the #1 driver for our financial performance in 2024. At its core, our Nordic transformation program is about further improving the customer experience, enable future growth and drive operational efficiencies. And in order to achieve that, we need to replace legacy technology, simplifying the IT stacks as well as the way we work. In addition, we will align around best practices methods and leverage scale and each other's successes across the organization.\nAnd we met or exceeded all the goals we set out for in 2024 for the four mentioned areas. So let me start from the left. Within Network and IT, our progress has been running ahead of schedule, and we shut down more than 68 more systems than targeted. Within Shared Services, we moved transactional back-office activities to a new shared service hub in Portugal, also beating our OpEx savings KPI, and this will be ramped up further this year. We also have a common program in place, focusing on improving working capital. Our structural improvement initiative generated approximately NOK 800 million in gross improvements compared to the targeted -- target of around nok 500 million. And then on the Commercial side, Nordic TV and Nordic Managed Services have now become two separate cross-Nordic teams. And these efforts enable us to save costs, but also to use our scale to develop attractive solutions for our customers.\nThese are the pan-Nordic activities and most of the transformation will happen on the business unit or country level. With regard to our workforce, we have on average, reduced the workforce by 4% per year since 2016. And we reduced external and internal FTEs by 6% in the Nordics in 2024, well in line with the indications we made last year. As a consequence of the need to stay future fit, I foresee that the drawdowns will be at least in the mid-single digits in the years ahead, in line with what we've indicated earlier.\nAnd before I welcome our CFO to the stage, I'd like to spend a few seconds on this slide. I'm pleased to say that we delivered yet another year of strong free cash flows in 2024, well above our original ambitions. I'm also happy to present a new outlook that reconfirms our financial ambitions covering our dividends in 2025 with free cash flows before M&A. On the back of increased line of sight for key 2025 drivers, we expect to deliver free cash flow before M&A of around NOK 13 billion in 2025.\nI'm so sorry to steal your thunder there for a moment, Torbjorn, but I'm sure you have more of it left. Good luck.\n\nTorbjorn Mogard Wist\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you. Thank you, Benedicte. And good morning to everybody. Delighted to be here to present the financial side of the presentation.\nBut before I go into the financials, I would like to say a few words about my background and key focus areas coming into the role which I have now held for five extremely engaging weeks. First of all, I'm very excited about returning to Telenor, where I previously spent some 13.5 years. I joined the group from Millenius Wilhamson, where I was the CFO for the last 4 and a bit years and where I also held the role of acting CEO for a period of 15 months.\nPrior to this, I was the CFO of Scandinavian Airlines, having joined the airline from Telenor. And before Telenor, my formative years were spent in investment banking, primarily covering the telecom sector. So I guess you can say that I'm returning home perhaps unlike in English football.\nNow with my experience from a capital-intensive businesses, the following three priorities are very high on my agenda coming into the role as Group CFO of Telenor. First, we need to make sure we have full momentum on a day-to-day basis to deliver on our promises for 2025. Secondly, shareholder remuneration is key for a company like us and in our type of industry, with predictability, growth and coverage of dividends, while at the same time, maintaining a strong balance sheet. Thirdly, we need to manage capital strategically, optimizing for the long term economic return on capital. And to do this, we must keep a strict eye on capital efficiency and scrutinize returns in terms of how we allocate our capital. And these will also be important parameters as we evolve our strategy for the 2026 to '28 period to be presented later in the year.\nThen let me take you through the highlights for the quarter and the year. Starting with '24, total service revenue growth was 3.3% for the group, for which mobile service revenue growth in the Nordics of 4.6% was the main driver. EBITDA growth came in at 3.5%. CapEx to sales, excluding leases for the group, were 16% as we sustained a relatively elevated level of investments in the Nordics. We ended the year with a strong free cash flow before M&A of NOK 11.4 billion and NOK 13.3 billion, if you include proceeds from M&A.\nZooming in on Q4, Service revenues grew by just over 1% and EBITDA came in at 2% as the macro setback in Bangladesh as well as three special items weighted on the numbers. Adjusted for these items, service revenues would have been close to 2% and EBITDA growth would have been 4.1%. CapEx to sales at 19% was driven by the pace of network rollout in the Nordics, alongside a minor catch-up effect as mild winter weather allowed us to continue rollout programs for longer. In addition, we completed 100% population coverage of 5G in Finland and the swapping of substantially all base station equipment in Sweden in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nFollowing a strong execution in Nordics, supported by some phasing effects as well as structural improvement in working capital, we generated a strong cash flow of NOK 3.1 billion before M&A in the quarter. This is a much stronger than anticipated, which I will cover later in the presentation.\nAs we dive in, let me start with group service revenues. As you can see on the right-hand side, the Nordics delivered according to plan, except for a VAT case in Norway, which dented fixed revenues slightly. However, the challenging business environment in Bangladesh continued to impact the top line negatively despite the best efforts of the team on the ground.\nTurning to OpEx. In Q4, we saw a flat development in OpEx year-over-year. In the Nordics, we saw a continued and substantial reduction in our operational maintenance costs, and this was partly offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs in quite a promotional quarter. In the Nordics, we reduced costs 1% in Q4 as a somewhat greater efficiency gain was masked by a one-off in Sweden. Our group EBITDA was impacted by the two one-offs in the Nordics in addition to a negative one-off effect from a correction of revenue items from previous years in Bangladesh as well as the overall macro situation in the country.\nWhile growth in the Nordics contributed strongly to EBITDA, these one-offs, in addition to the negative EBITDA growth in Bangladesh, slowed growth for the group to 2%. Adjusted for these onetime items, however, the number would have been 4.1% as mentioned previously.\nNow with 18% growth, quite a few things went Amp's away this quarter, bucking the negative trend from recent quarters and while not completely out of the woods yet, we believe Amp will return to a more consistent growth from the second half of this year.\nThen turning to revenue growth in the Nordics. Service revenues in Telenor Nordics came in at 2.3%. And adjusted for the VAT-related case that I mentioned, underlying growth was at 2.6%. The service revenue growth in the Nordics was primarily driven by mobile service revenues of 3.3%. DNA in Finland delivered another strong quarter and making the largest contribution to top line growth. And I'm very pleased to see that DNA delivered more than 6% mobile service revenue growth year-on-year in a quite competitive and promotional Q4.\nIn Norway, we grew mobile ARPU by 4.9%, continuing our more-for-more strategy, and this was secured by building on our strong network and security brand position and by adding new security services into our mobile portfolio and through our separately sold digital security and safety subscriptions. Yesterday, we built further on this strategy as we announced a new mobile subscription lineup in Norway with suspected fraud call alert and caller ID included.\nFixed service revenues in Norway were driven by broadband ARPU growth of 3.6%, low growth in fiber connection was somewhat more than offset by a decline on the cable and fixed wireless access side, in line with recent trends. We saw a strong net additions in both Sweden and Denmark in the quarter. Mobile service revenues grew close to 5% for the quarter in Denmark. Sweden was able to drive sequential subscriber growth of around 30,000 new postpaid customers but revenue growth was held back by a challenging year-on-year comparison and a couple of special revenue recognition items last year. We do not see the flatness in Sweden as a representative going forward, and we feel reasonably well positioned heading into 2025.\nMoving to EBITDA. All businesses contributed to a solid growth of 6% in the Nordics. Adjusting for one-offs and assuming flat energy costs, the figure would have been 6.2%. Without the energy assumption, we would have been at 7.4%. Execution on our transformation agenda led to efficiencies that effectively offset meaningfully higher sales and marketing costs in the quarter with quite pronounced campaign seasonality across the Nordics.\nIn Asia, our colleagues in Telenor Pakistan truly knocked it out of the park in Q4 with 12% service revenue growth, thanks to strong pricing efforts in a market with significantly lower inflation. This resulted in 25% EBITDA growth, which was also helped by lower energy costs in the country. However, Grameenphone, again, despite the team's best efforts on the ground, was a drag on our Asia total as we did not see any pickup in consumer spending during Q4. On top of the macro conditions, the performance was way down by NOK 90 million revenue correction and a larger-than-usual bad debt provision.\nAs usual, we also received a quarterly dividend from Celcom Digi in Malaysia of around NOK 354 million.\nThen let's take a look at the P&L, cash flows and leverage. In our P&L, EBITDA and operating profit were reasonably flat year-on-year, measured in variable currency. However, the contribution in net income from associated companies improved by more than NOK 1 billion due to improved underlying profitability in True and an impairment in True's books last year. The main special item on our side was the NOK 411 million impairment of goodwill in our associated company, Carousell.\nOur financial items were lower than usual, favorably impacted by fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps. And as we approach the bottom line, there was a loss on discontinued operations of NOK 184 million mainly related to accrued interest and currency effect on our residual obligations in India. This led us to an EPS at NOK 1.27 for the quarter and NOK 13.88 for the full year, both significantly better than the year before. And as you may recall, last year was affected by write-downs that have been more than reversed this year.\nJust briefly on the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong and has a manageable and prudent maturity profile. The sequential increase in net leverage to 2.4 was mainly driven by our payment of the second tranche of our 2023 dividends as well as a small unfavorable FX impact.\nNow as in Q2 of 2023, the ratio ended -- the leverage ratio ended slightly above our target range of 1.8 to 2.3. But as we have flagged in the past, this may occur from time to time depending on the seasonality of dividend payments, currency fluctuations and other factors impacting EBITDA, such as the macro setback in Bangladesh. We expect the leverage ratio to return to the target range during the year with EBITDA growth and increased dividends from associated companies being the key contributors. Specifically, we expect to see meaningful dividends from True in Thailand in the second half of the year.\nHaving generated NOK 2.8 billion of free cash flow before M&A in the third quarter, we topped this with NOK 3.1 billion in Q4. We had some favorable timing effects on working capital with NOK 0.3 billion of payments slipping into the first quarter of this year. We have also phased in a bit more than NOK 0.5 billion in third-party handset financing. However, we believe nearly half of the NOK 1.6 billion improvement in working capital is of a more structural nature.\nIn retrospect, I think it is fair to recognize that some of the timing effects we have talked about in recent quarters indeed represent improvements of a more structural nature rather than a series of timing effects. And this is because we have deployed a broad working capital toolbox and improvement agenda, looking at accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories. In Q4, we saw the normal seasonality of CapEx with a portion of the payments being pushed into Q1 this year. In the same quarter last year, the seasonality was somewhat less pronounced.\nAs mentioned, we also received quarterly dividends from Celcom Digi. And on the outflow side, as flagged in Q3, we had a residual payout to noncontrolling interest in Bangladesh. Of course, once we take dividends from Bangladesh, our minority partner will also get their share.\nNext, I want to note the sequential increase of close to NOK 300 million in quarterly lease payments. Part of this increase is related to timing of payments and part is due to increased tower leases in Asia as well as refresh and roll out of customer equipment. We do see lease payments increasing going forward with Q4 being a close proxy to the average level we expect in '25. Nevertheless, amounts will, of course, vary between quarters.\nWe ended the year with NOK 11.4 billion of free cash flow before M&A, a result with which we are very, very pleased.\nNow let's move to dividends and outlook. Starting with the dividends. As mentioned, delivering on our shareholder remuneration policy is very, very key to us as management and to our Board. And we continue to deliver on our 15-year track record of consistent nominal growth in dividends. In accordance with our dividend policy of growing dividends per share, the Board has proposed a dividend for 2024 of NOK 9.60 per share for approval at the upcoming AGM with payments falling due in June and October of this year.\nAnd this brings us to our financial outlook. And I'm happy to say that we partially outperformed our own expectations for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2024. But as we all know, goalpost, they continue to shift. So now let's look at our '25 guidance. In the Nordics, we expect a low single-digit growth in service revenues. As for Nordic EBITDA, we expect mid-single-digit growth, while we foresee CapEx to sales, excluding leases, of around 14% in the Nordics. This is down from the more elevated 17% level we had in the year from '22 to '24 and in nominal terms, this equates to a NOK 1.5 billion to NOK 2 billion step-down from the 2022 level of NOK 10 billion, depending, of course, on currencies and timing of project milestones.\nAs for the group outlook, we expect group EBITDA to grow in the low to mid-single digits, where the outcome within that range will depend on the shape, strength as well as speed of recovery in Bangladesh. Also note that we still include Pakistan in the outlook. The regulatory approval process in Pakistan is a bit delayed, but we still expect the deal to close by late Q2. In any event, we do not expect the exact timing of closing to significantly impact our outlook.\nNow as for quarterly seasonality and comparability in '25 versus '24, I would like to remind you that we had a particularly strong Q1 last year with an extra day of revenues as well as some phasing effects of marketing and sales costs to later quarters. In addition, we will face tougher comparable quarters in Grameenphone in the first half of the year because, obviously, the macro conditions we are experiencing now were not present last year.\nOn free cash flows, we outperformed the 2024 outlook quite significantly, and this was mostly due to working capital, but we nevertheless reconfirm our ambition of dividend coverage for 2025 with around NOK 13 billion in free cash flow before M&A.\nFinally, let me be clear on how -- what we view to be the main building blocks for our cash flow outlook. And these remain: number one, continued growth and transformation in the Nordics; number two, reduced capital intensity in the Nordics; and number three, increased dividends from associates. The first two are given by the outlook for the Nordics and is, of course, a substantial sum taken together. The third incremental element remains our expectation of increased dividends from our associates mostly from True, which do not pay dividends currently. And our clear expectation is that True will start to contribute with meaningful dividends from the second half of this year.\nIn terms of the impact of other areas, first, while we will continue to work to reduce working capital meaningfully also in 2025, we expect a year-on-year delta to be negative given the strong NOK 2.7 billion cash flow from working capital in -- in 2024. Secondly, lease payments are increasing, as mentioned earlier. And finally, we do not, at this point, foresee a significant increase in interest and tax payments through this year as we expect to continue to benefit from tax loss carried forward through '25 as well as overall relatively stable interest rates.\nIn sum, while our free cash flow forecast is not without risks, we have far better visibility now on the drivers than we had when we set the ambition back in '22. And this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver free cash flow before M&A of around NOK 13 billion this year.\nAnd with that, I will hand over to Benedicte for some concluding remarks before we open up for Q&A.\n\nBenedicte Schilbred Fasmer\n\nCEO, SpareBank 1 SR-Bank ASA\n\nThank you so much, Torbjorn. I'd like to summarize our key messages as follows. We delivered a solid progress towards our midterm 2025 financial ambitions as well as our sustainability goals in Q4 and in 2024 as a whole. Torbjorn and I, alongside the rest of the management team are strongly committed to our strategy and will seek to evolve it further. Our goal is to unlock further potential for profitable growth while maintaining strict capital management and focusing on return on capital employed. To do this, we need to keep Telenor future fit, sharpen our customer mindset further and intensify the transformation work that we are doing in the Nordics and elsewhere.\nWe are committed to our dividend policy, generating attractive shareholder remuneration over time while maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I feel really excited to work with the organization to harness the full potential of Telenor in its next phase and to build a stronger Telenor for the long run.\nAnd with this, I'll hand you back to Frank and to the Q&A."

Nograles\n\nVice President & Investor Relations Head\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm Jinggay Nograles, Head of Investor Relations here at PLDT. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter financial and operations results briefing. Joining us today to share insights into PLDT's performance and strategic direction are Smart Communications Chief Operating Officer, Boy Martirez; PLDT Chief Operating Officer, Jimenez Jr.; PLDT Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Danny Yu; PLDT [indiscernible]; PLDT Chief Legal Counsel, Attorney Joan De Venecia-Fabul.\nÂ\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we will have a Q&A session after the presentation. [Operator Instructions]Â\nTo start, I'd like to invite our CFO, Mr. Danny Yu, to walk us through PLDT's financial performance for the first quarter.\n\nDanny Y. Yu\n\nSenior VP & PLDT Group Controller\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Allow me to present PLDT's first quarter performance, covering key results and business highlights. Our net [Technical Difficulty]Â  slightly up year-on-year. On a gross basis, our revenue reached PHP 53.4 billion, up 2% from last year. EBITDA grew by 2% to PHP 27.9 billion, driven by continued strength in our fiber and ICT segments, coupled with prudent cost management. Telco Core income was recorded at PHP 8.8 billion, down 6% year-on-year, reflecting increased depreciation linked to recent strategic investment in network infra, coupled with related financing costs. Core income was steady at PHP 8.9 billion, driven by Maya's positive earnings contribution as it turned profitable this quarter.\nÂ\nAs we move forward, we will continue to pursue steady revenue growth, disciplined expense management, asset monetization, and prudent capital allocation. Net service revenue growth reflects stable demand across our key business segments, mobile data, fiber, corporate data, and ICT. Starting with Home, revenue rose by 4% year-on-year to PHP 15.2 billion, thanks to continued fiber demand. Fiber now accounts for 97% of Home revenues, up from 92% in 2024 as we steadily migrate legacy subscribers.Â\nIn enterprise, total revenue remained steady at PHP 11.9 billion year-on-year with a slight 1% uptick in corporate data and ICT revenues. Within this segment, ICT stands out, growing 16% year-on-year to PHP 2.2 billion, now accounting for over 22% of enterprise revenues, up from 19% a year ago. Although our connectivity business is navigating a transitional phase, we are actively building a pipeline of new opportunities by leveraging our emerging technologies.\nÂ\nLastly, on mobile, revenues were down slightly at PHP 21.3 billion due to lower packet Wi-Fi usage as customers shifted to smartphones or fixed data access. Some prepared packages available in the first quarter of 2024 were also adjusted, leading to less headline growth but better fundamentals. We're also encouraged by rapid 5G adoption and a steady rise in data traffic, which point towards improved monetization and growth moving forward. Mobile data, fiber, corporate data, and ICT, which now account for 89% of total revenues from 88% in 2024, continued to expand, offsetting legacy revenue declines. Excluding legacy services, net service revenues grew by 2%.\nÂ\nNow let's take a closer look at Home segment. Home revenue rose 4% year-on-year, reaching PHP 15.2 billion. This growth was mainly driven by fiber, which posted a healthy 7% increase to PHP 14.7 billion. Our shift from legacy to fiber is progressing well, with fiber now representing 97% of total home revenues, up significantly from 92% in 2024. We also added 101,000 net new subscribers this quarter compared to negative net additions a year ago. This improvement came from stronger network coverage and expanded port availability from recent investments. ARPU remained stable at around PHP 1,493, reflecting our success in bundling high-value products while managing churn effectively. Our churn rate of less than 2% remains among the lowest in the industry. Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our fiber footprint with targeted initiatives and diversified offerings.\nÂ\nTurning now to Enterprise. The unit delivered steady results with total revenues at PHP 11.9 billion. Corporate data and ICT, on the other hand, improved by 1% to PHP 8.8 billion. This growth was tempered by the impact of lost connectivity as the industry shut down last year. That said, [indiscernible] business continues to perform well, growing at 16% compared to the same period last year. Managed IT services expanded 101%, cyber security services rose by 69%, credit scoring by 48%, and data center colocation revenues jumped 37%. As a result, ICT now makes up over 24% of our enterprise revenues to 19% a year ago.\nÂ\nWe're working on new opportunities, leveraging on [Technical Difficulty] network application programming andÂ [Technical Difficulty]. Additionally, the recently activated Asia Direct Cable further strengthens our competitive advantage, enhancing international capacity and network resilience for enterprise customers.\nÂ\nTurning to the individual segment. Total revenues came in at PHP 21.3 billion, down slightly by 1% year-on-year as we continue to see customers shift away from packet Wi-Fi towards smartphone-based data usage. Mobile data revenues, on the other hand, were stable at PHP 18.8 billion, impacted partially by the termination of long validity offers that front-loaded revenues in the first quarter of 2024. Despite relatively flat revenues, underlying trends remain encouraging. 5G data traffic surged 81% year-on-year. 5G device adoption also showed robust growth, up 60% quarter-on-quarter. The ongoing shift to 5G has significantly improved our network efficiency and freed up additional LTE capacity, resulting in a better overall customer experience. We expect this increased 5G adoption and improved network efficiency to help stabilize revenues and drive future growth in the individual segment.\nÂ\nPLDT delivered PHP 27.9 billion in EBITDA for the first quarter of 2025, a 2% increase year-on-year, demonstrating our ongoing efforts in managing costs while maintaining a resilient revenue base. OpEx, including subsidies and provisions, declined by PHP 300 million to PHP 86.1 billion, reinforcing operational discipline. Our EBITDA margin remains strong at 52%. Telco Core income was at PHP 8.8 billion, lower by 6% year-on-year, mainly due to increased depreciation from network expansion and associated financing costs. Our core income, on the other hand, held steady year-on-year at PHP 8.8 billion, supported by Maya's positive contribution. A key highlight this quarter is Maya turning profitable, marking a significant milestone. Maya contributed PHP 127 million in net income, a clear turnaround from prior year's losses, powered by robust loan growth, strong momentum in deposits, and increased payment volume.\nÂ\nNow let's move on to CapEx and our debt profile. For the first quarter of 2025, our CapEx stood at PHP 10.8 billion, lower compared to last year, resultingÂ in a reduced CapEx intensity of 20%. This lower spend is partly due to timing as a significant portion of our project completions will occur in the second half of the year. Our CapEx guidance for 2025 is adjusted slightly to PHP 68 to PHP 70Â [Technical Difficulty]Â to improve our quality of service. While we work on increasing CapEx, we are committed to deliver greater outcomes through efficient use of capital and strengthen negotiations with contractors and suppliers.\nLet's review our debt profile. Our net debt at the end of March stood at PHP 270.7 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.48x, slightly improved from 2.52x at the end of 2024. Our debt maturity profile remains well balanced, with 52% of total debt maturing beyond 2030. The average debt maturity stands at 6.5 years. We maintain prudent risk management. Foreign currency exposure remains low, with just 5% of total debt unhedged. Importantly, PLDT retains investment-grade credit ratings of BBB from S&P Global and Baa2 from Moody's, underscoring investor confidence in our financial health. Looking forward, we remain committed to generating positive free cash flow by 2026 and continue working towards reducing our leverage, targeting around 2.0x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio over the medium term.\nNow I'd like to shift gears and share some exciting developments from two of our key growth drivers beyond traditional Telco. One is VITRO, our state-of-the-art data center business, and Maya, our fintech driver, both continue to demonstrate strong momentum and reinforcing PLDT's commitment to innovation and digital leadership. OurÂ VITROÂ data centers, particularly our newly energized hyperscale facility in Santa Rosa, represent a major strategic step positioning PLDT at the forefront of Philippines' digital infra landscape. Now let's watch this short video to give you a closer look atÂ VITROÂ Santa Rosa and why we believe it is very essential in all this supporting theÂ\n[Presentation]\nThe world as we know it is changing. Scaling, moving in hypergrowth a robust restructuring of every aspect of our lives through artificial intelligence, keeping in step with the Philippines' move to be the next digital destination of the region. This year,Â VITROÂ Incorporated unveils the Philippines' first AI-ready hyperscale data center,Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa, designed to power tomorrow's digital demands.Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa celebrates an impressive 50 megawatts of power capacity.Â  This immense power ensures unparallel performance for enterprises, hyperscalers, and AI workloads alike. With a Tier-3 certification,Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa guarantees a 99.99% service level agreement that's true reliability you can count on. It's resilient power, cooling, and connectivity ensure your mission-critical operations never miss a beat.\nAt its core lies a diverse network infrastructure equipped with a triple route domestic fiber network.Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa ensures continued operations with the longest latency and maximum resilience. Step into a thriving digital ecosystem where enterprise, cloud, and AI data seamlessly connect and synergize, where everything your business needs is within reach, and let your data takes center stage. And with it's AI-ready infrastructure,Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa is prepared to unlock the true potential of artificial intelligence.Â\nHosted inÂ VITROÂ Santa Rosa, ePLDT is the first to bring NVIDIA-powered GPU servers to the Philippines.Â ePLDTÂ can now offer GPU as a service boasting of enhanced security and reduced latency ideal for critical AI tasks that require fast response times.Â WithÂ ePLDT's GPU as a service, enterprises and government agencies can access powerful computing on a pay-per-use basis, making AI adoption faster and cost-efficient. From training complex models to powering real-time applications,Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa is where AI thrives and connects to the rest of the country.Â  Connected to the country's domestic and international fiber network,Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa serves as a gateway to the rest of the Philippines and the world.Â\nVITROÂ Santa Rosa isn't just a data center, it's the home of AI and hyper connectivity, carrying the digital future today. True infrastructure reliability, true AI capabilities, a first for the Philippines. This isÂ VITROÂ Santa Rosa.\nAs you have seen in the video,Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa represents a significant step forward, not just for PLDT but also for the Philippines' broader digital ecosystem. Officially inaugurated last month by President Marcos, this pioneering facility highlights our commitment to powering the nation's digital transformation. During the inauguration, President Marcos underscored that in today's world, data has become as essential as water and electricity. We emphasize the critical importance of continuously strengthening our data infra, particularly with safeguarding sensitive and confidential information.Â VITROÂ Santa Rosa is uniquely positioned to meet these demands, significantly enhances our ability to support the nation's digital growth.Â\nI'm also pleased to share another strategic infra milestone, the recent launch of the Asia Direct Cable. This new subsea cable spanning 9,400 kilometers significantly enhances PLDT's international connectivity. With a substantial 27 terabits per second capacity, the Asia Direct Cable offers unmatched low-latency connections, particularly between China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan. This further strengthens PLDT's position as the country's largest fixed-line network provider with the most extensive set of international gateway facilities.\nFor PLDT, the investment translates to strategic advantages ensuring faster, more reliable, and direct access to our state-of-the-art facilities such asÂ VITROÂ Santa Rosa. In short, the Asia Direct Cable is more than impact. It's a core enabler of future revenue growth, service reliability and market leadership.\nNow let's turn to another key growth engine, Maya, our fintech driver. Let me start by framing what makes Maya uniquely positioned for sustainable growth and profitability. The short answer is it's a unique all-in-one ecosystem that combines payment, banking, lending into a seamless platform for both consumers and businesses. This integrated model creates efficiency, scale, recurring engagement, which not only accelerates our growth but also strengthens our pathway to continued profitability. We believe that this comprehensive ecosystem gives Maya a clear structural advantage enabling it to capture long-term value while continuing to deliver innovative, inclusive financial services to millions of Filipinos.\nI'll now take you through Maya's performance for the first quarter of 2025. Here, you will see how this ecosystem approach continues to drive results across deposits, lending, payments, and customer engagement. In the first quarter of '25, Maya achieved positive net income. This marked its first full profitable quarter, a keyÂ milestone for its growth momentum.Â\nÂ\nMaya continues to lead as both the #1 digital bank and the #1 merchant acquirer in the Philippines. The company has seen impressive momentum across key metrics. 6.8 million bank customers, up 88% year-on-year, reinforcing Maya's position as the most adopted digital banking platform in the country, 1.8 million borrowers, doubling year-on-year, driven by strong credit demand and AI-powered digital lending, PHP 44 billion in total deposits, representing a 49% year-on-year increase and maintaining Maya's leading deposit market share among digital banks. And finally, PHP 120 million in cumulative loans disbursed since inception.Â\nÂ\nOn the payment side, Maya also retains the largest market share in card acquiring transactions, reinforcing its leadership in both online and in-store merchant payments. This potent combination of scaling adoption, growing credit, healthy deposits and profitability reflects Maya's unique position as the Philippines' leading integrated digital banking and payments ecosystem.Â\nÂ\nNow let me break down Maya's banking performance in more detail. The bank continues to see strong growth in consumer deposits, which reached PHP 44 billion by end of March, representing a 49% year-on-year increase. This is a clear indicator of user trust and consistent engagement on the platform. Since 2022, deposits have nearly tripled.Â\nÂ\nAlongside this, Maya has also scaled lending significantly. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, it disbursed PHP 28 billion in loans, bringing total disbursed since inception to PHP 120 billion. Now loan book quality remains solid. Maya's loan outstanding balance stood at PHP 21 billion at the end of March, with asset quality well managed. Its NPL ratio was 3.8% below both digital banking and broader industry averages. All in all, Maya is not just growing. It's also do so responsibly with strong fundamentals in both deposit and credit performance.Â\nÂ\nMaya's growth story isn't just about selling products. It's also about deepening engagement and creating a platform that enables our partners to access a tech-savvy, highly engaged customer base. In the first quarter of '25, Maya expanded its consumer platform through high-impact collaborations across lifestyle, entertainment, and insurance. Some examples include the following: the integration of PAL Mini application within Maya that offers users a more seamless travel and loyalty experience.Â\nÂ\nMaya now provides accessible insurance products directly in the application through Singlife. All through our partnership with Pepsi-Cola, Maya is enabling both payment processing and working capital loans for their network of more than 200,000 sari-sari stores and distributors, partnered with ABS, CBN, and GMA for Pinoy Big Brothers celebrity edition. This campaign drove a 3% increase in viewership compared to previous seasons and significantly boosted in-app user activity via interactive voting features.Â\nÂ\nMaya is also seeing strong traction in consumer credit. It has issued approximately 200,000 credit cards since its launch in August of 2024. These moves strengthen Maya's position not just as a fintech and digital bank, but as a daily financial partner, helping Filipino spend, save, invest and borrow.Â\nÂ\nNow before we close out, I'd like to share some updates on sustainability as we continue to expand our efforts to embed this in our business. During the quarter, PLDT and Smart enacted biodiversity policies that commit to no net deforestation and no net loss in forest cover. As we roll out our network facilities, these policies ensure that we comply with environmental regulations and do not negatively impact the environment and local communities. PLDT and Smart continued to strengthen initiatives to keep our customers safe and protect children online. This includes access to malicious content. With the election of PLDT to the Governing Council of the Philippine Business Coalition on Women Empowerment and of our Chief Sustainability Officer to the Board of Trustees of the Global Compact Network Philippines, we have new opportunities to collaborate with like-minded institutions and champion sustainability in business.Â\nÂ\nNow that concludes our prepared remarks for PLDT's first quarter performance. At this point, we would be happy to open the floor for your questions."

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's Third Quarter 2024 results and outlook for our fourth quarter. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.\nIn addition, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. Finally, during the Q&A portion of today's call due to the number of participants, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question, and you may rejoin the queue if you have a second question. Now let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin\n\nChief Executive Officer and Board Member, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Sujal, and I also appreciate everybody joining us today for the call. As I'd like to do before we get into the slides and the details, I do want to take a moment to provide some performance highlights along with what we're seeing versus our call just 90 days ago. As we've shared in our calls throughout this year, we continue to be in a dynamic global economic environment. And I just want to take a few minutes of explaining what that means when you think about where TE is positioned.\nFirst off, in our largest market, automotive, we're seeing stability on a global basis. In our Industrial Solutions segment, we continue to see growth in 3 out of our 4 businesses. And those businesses are focused on aerospace and defense, energy as well as medical applications. And in our Communications segment, like we talked last quarter, we have returned to growth, and we are benefiting from an acceleration in artificial intelligence applications. Now against these growth areas, we are still being offset by ongoing weakness in just the general industrial markets, and we'll highlight where they are throughout the call in to Q&A.\nWithin this backdrop, our sales in the third quarter were in line with our guidance and roughly flat year-over-year. I am pleased that we delivered strong adjusted margin expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year and adjusted EPS that exceeded our guidance. As we look at our performance year-to-date, our teams have delivered record adjusted operating margins and earnings per share even in a dynamic market environment, which demonstrates our strong operational performance. Our results continue to reflect successful execution against the key initiatives we committed to coming into this fiscal year.\nWe anticipated a slow demand environment overall in our markets. So our focus has been on driving margin and earnings improvement this year. Our teams have driven strong margin expansion year-over-year, and this is most evident in our Transportation and Communications segments. The high quality of our earnings continues to be reflected also in our strong cash generation model, and I'm pleased with the record free cash flow of $2 billion through the first 3 quarters of this year, and we do expect this to continue into our fourth quarter.\nNow let me briefly share what we're seeing in our market since our call 90 days ago, and what we're seeing in our order patterns and I'll get into order patterns in more detail a little bit later. First off, in transportation, our outlook for global auto production is consistent with our view 90 days ago. We continue to see growth in China, and that's offsetting incremental weakness in Europe. In our Industrial Solutions segment, our view remains unchanged. We continue to see 3 out of our 4 businesses with growth momentum and continued weakness in industrial equipment end markets. And as I said earlier, in our Communications segment, our markets are back to growth, and that's in both businesses. And finally, before we get into the slides, I do want to reiterate that our long-term value creation model remains unchanged, and it's centered around 3 pillars.\nFirst off is our portfolio is strategically positioned around secular growth trends including adoption of renewable energy, applications for artificial intelligence and growth in the global hybrid and electric vehicle production, along with further electronification of the vehicle. The second pillar of value creation is that we have operational levers to drive strong margin performance through economic cycles. And you're seeing the results in this quarter, and we have more opportunity as we go forward. And thirdly, as we look beyond this year, we are set up for strong performance. We expect to continue to benefit from the secular growth drivers as well as also expect continued growth in areas like commercial aerospace, along with normalization of destocking and industrial equipment. This sets us up for an improved growth trajectory, leading to further operating earnings growth going forward.\nNow with that as an overview, I'd like to get into the slides. And if you could look at Slide 3, I'll discuss some of the additional highlights for the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, then Heath will get into more details as he gets into his section. Our third quarter sales were $4 billion, which was in line with our guidance and up 2% organically year-over-year. Orders of $4.1 billion were up year-over-year and sequentially driven by momentum in artificial intelligence design wins. Adjusted earnings per share was ahead of our guidance at $1.91, and this was up 8% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.3%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by the strong operational performance of our teams.\nWe are expecting fourth quarter sales of approximately $4 billion, including approximately $60 million of year-over-year currency exchange headwinds. On the margin front, quarter 4 will be another quarter of strong year-over-year expansion and we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.94, which will be up 9% year-over-year and which includes a $0.10 headwinds from both currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate. I talked to you earlier about the performance we've been driving in this market environment. And when you think about what's implied for the full year given our fourth quarter guidance, you really get to see the strong performance with adjusted earnings per share expected to be up 12% year-over-year with sales that are essentially flat.\nSo with that as a brief overview, let me get into some more details on order trends, and they're on Slide 4 of the presentation we posted. Our orders were up 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to over $4.1 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.04 billion. As I talk about order by segment, I will be talking about orders sequentially as we believe this reflects business trends better. At the company level, order growth was driven by the Communications segment. which grew over 50% sequentially. Growth was driven primarily by orders for AI applications with multiple customers and reflects that destocking in both data and devices and appliances are behind us.\nIn transportation, you see a slight sequential order decline, but this was really driven by weakness in commercial transportation and our sensors end markets that are tied really to the general industrial market. Our orders in auto were relatively flat sequentially. In industrial, order patterns continue to reflect ongoing destocking and industrial equipment end markets. Now let me get into year-over-year segment results, and I'll start with our Transportation segment on Slide 5. Our auto business grew 4% organically against our global auto production decline of 1%. Our content growth over production was 5 points in the third quarter with strong double-digit organic sales growth in China, more than offsetting declines in Europe and North America.\nWhile we continue to see different production dynamics by region as well as some shifts in production of different powertrains, we continue to expect content growth in our second half and longer term to be in the 4- to 6-point range. Our growth over market will continue to be driven both by increased electric vehicle and hybrid production and greater electronification of the vehicle. Turning to our commercial transportation business. The 8% organic decline that you see was driven primarily by weakness in Europe. We expect this business to be again down sequentially in the fourth quarter and expect the markets we serve to be down in the mid- to high single digits this fiscal year due to market declines that are happening in the West.\nIn our Sensors business, the sales decline continued to be driven by market weakness in industrial applications as well as portfolio optimization efforts that we've discussed with you. where we're continuing to organically exit lower margin and lower growth products. For the Transportation segment overall, adjusted operating margins were up over 200 basis points to 21% driven by continued strong execution on operational levers. We also continue to invest to support next-generation vehicles, whether they're around electrification of the powertrain, high-speed Ethernet for data applications in the vehicle, for miniaturized Power and Signal products to leverage next-generation architectural shifts by our global customers.\nNow let's get to the Industrial Solutions segment, and that's on Slide 6. In this segment, we continue to see the same trends we've been discussing all year. Sales were down slightly 2% organically. Our Aerospace, Defense and Marine business sales were up 19% organically, driven by growth both in commercial aerospace as well as defense markets. In medical, sales in the quarter were up 7% organically, driven by ongoing increases in interventional procedures. And in Energy, sales were up 3% organically, driven by strength in the Americas and Europe, with continued strong momentum in renewable applications. As you can see on the slide, the [ PACA ] weakness for the segment is in the industrial equipment business, where our sales were down 24% organically. While we are starting to see some signs of order patterns flattening, we still expect to see year-over-year declines in this business in the fourth quarter as our OEM customers and channel partners continue to reduce inventory levels.\nIndustrial segment adjusted operating margins were 15.1%, which was in line with our expectations given current volume levels and business mix. We continue to expect the segment margin to run in the mid-teens until the Industrial Equipment business returns to growth. Now if you could turn to Slide 7, and I'll get into the discussion around the Communications segment. First off, and you can see it on the slide, I am excited about the return to year-over-year growth and our strong margin performance. In data and devices, we grew 32% organically, and our design wins are reflecting accelerating momentum. I discussed our order momentum earlier. And based upon these wins, we are increasing our near-term expectations of AI revenue to over $250 million this year, and we expect this to more than double as we get into 2025.\nIn our appliances business, we grew 12% organically, driven by both the Americas and China. From an operating margin perspective, the segment had adjusted margins of 20%, this was up over 600 basis points over last year, driven by the higher volumes coupled with stronger operational performance. So with this as a quick summary of our segment performance, let me turn it over to Heath, who's going to get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward.\n\nHeath A. Mitts\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. And before I get into the details of the financials, I want to reiterate something that Terrence said earlier, we are dealing with a slower market environment. We've talked to you about that throughout the year. But our focus this year, as discussed, has been on improving margins and earnings. I'm pleased to be able to sit here and say that we have set records for quarterly adjusted operating margins and earnings per share in the third quarter, and we feel good about the momentum going forward.\nNow the details. Adjusted operating income was $766 million with an adjusted operating margin of 19.3%. GAAP operating income was $755 million and included $5 million of acquisition-related charges and $6 million of restructuring and other charges. Year-to-date, restructuring charges are $57 million. For the full year, we continue to expect restructuring charges to be approximately $100 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.91, and GAAP EPS was $1.86, and included restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.05. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23% in the third quarter, slightly higher than our guidance due to some jurisdictional rate adjustments. For the fourth quarter and for the full year, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. And importantly, as always, I just want to remind you that we continue to expect our cash rate to stay well below our adjusted ETR for the full year.\nIf you turn to Slide 9, we delivered strong margin and EPS expansion along with record year-to-date free cash flow with sales that are roughly flat year-over-year. Sales of $4 billion were down 1% on a reported basis, up 2% on an organic basis year-over-year, and we are continuing to see headwinds from a stronger dollar which unfavorably impacted sales by roughly $80 million in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margins were 19.3% in the third quarter, expanding 200 basis points year-over-year, this was driven by year-over-year margin expansion in our Transportation and Communications segments. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.91, up 8% year-over-year, driven by strong margin expansion and included headwinds of $0.18 from currency exchange and a higher tax rate.\nTurning to cash flow. Cash from operations was $1 billion, and free cash flow was $867 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have delivered free cash flow of roughly $2 billion, that's up 36% year-over-year, and we expect to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion well above 100%. With the strong free cash generation, we have deployed over $2.2 billion so far this year with $1.8 billion returned to shareholders and approximately $350 million deployed for acquisitions. Our cash generation model continues to give us both confidence and opportunities to return capital to shareholders while supporting bolt-on M&A activities. And just to reiterate our long-term capital strategy remains unchanged, which is to return approximately 2/3 of free cash flow to shareholders to use approximately 1/3 for bolt-on acquisitions over time.\nAnd before I turn it over to questions, let me reinforce some of the key points that we discussed today and share how we are thinking about our performance and opportunities going forward. Our team is navigating this environment well. we are delivering margin and EPS expansion while continuing to invest for future growth. We are very well positioned to benefit from the secular growth trends and drive further operating earnings growth. We're demonstrating our strong free cash -- strong cash generation model with the balanced deployment of capital.\nSo we remain very excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us to drive value creation for all our stakeholders. And with that, let's now open it up for questions."

    "content": "Q2 2024 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2024 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nTELOSLOJUL 18, 3:00 AM\n\nFrank Maao\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Telenor's second quarter results call. My name is Frank Maao, Head of Investor Relations. And with me today, I have Sigve Brekke, our CEO; and also acting CFO, Kasper Wold Kaarboe. As usual, within the presentation material today, all the references we make to growth rates are made on an organic like-for-like currency basis. So today, Sigve will give an update on how the Nordic transformation process is going and also give a few comments on progress in Asia. And after this, Kasper will go through our financials and outlook. Then Sigve will sum it all up and open up for questions.\nNow on an especially hectic earnings day with overlapping calls, we'll try to keep the session today a bit shorter and make sure everyone has a chance to ask their questions. So given this, we really appreciate if you could limit yourself to one question today, please, restraining yourself through a clarification on the follow-ups.\nSo Sigve, the floor is yours.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nThank you, Frank. And thanks for tuning in, everyone. I'm pleased with the performance of the second quarter. We continue to deliver on our strategy. And this quarter's growth on top line, EBITDA end at NOK 2.2 billion free cash flow, I see that as yet another proof point that our strategy works. In the Nordics, it is encouraging to see how the Nordic transformation is progressing in line with our ambitions. We are delivering yet another quarter with flat OpEx, and now the transformation program is approaching an inflection point, and I will come back to this in a few seconds.\nCash flow in Asia is a key part of our strategy, both Grameenphone and Celcom Digi already have solid cash flows. But to reach our ambition, True in Thailand will be the key. I [indiscernible] True a few weeks ago and meeting our colleagues there, I continue to be impressed by how far they have come since the merger last year. True has really been gaining traction with growth picking up as well as synergies being ahead of Tel.\nIn line with our strategy, and we have talked about it before, on focusing on near core services, and what we call on top of connectivity services, we continue to focus on strengthening our offerings and capabilities within digital security. By the products, we have developed both in the B2C segment and in the B2B, we have been able to build a leading market position across the Nordics on a growing security demand for our customers. This quarter, we successfully launched a new security offering to our customers in the business market in Norway. Hence, to further build on our capabilities and serve our business customers, we are also setting up a new cybersecurity company in our business area, Amp.\nThen coming back to the Nordics. As you know, June was marked by the tragic passing of Jorgen Rostrup, our leader of the Nordic business area. I miss him deeply. But in Jorgen spirit, we continue to focus on business. And as I mentioned in the first quarter, we would, in this quarter, give an update on the Nordic confirmation. So let me turn into that.\nI'm very pleased that [ John Owen Revo ] has taken a new top role acting as a new head of Nordics. We have a strong pool of experienced and passionate employees and senior leaders in Telenor. And Jon Owen is one of them. His team, together with the business units, are planning and executing on what I call a fairly radical improvements in terms of customer benefits and operating efficiencies. We are driving this within the four functional areas you see in this slide and also across the four Nordic operations. It's in within network and IT, within shared services in the commercial area and when it comes to working capital. So let me now in this quarter, give a few examples and showing you some tangible results of what we have achieved so far.\nStarting with Network & IT. In this domain, we have an AI-first and [indiscernible] first strategy. We are now migrating operations to the cloud, shutting down legacy platforms and systems and planning to scale up the use of generative AI. For this year 2024, we have set an ambition to shut down 200 legacy systems. And so far, we have done 98 of them. We are also building a common Nordic platform within areas such as [ cloud invent ], analytics and software-defined networks, SDX, which will provide the basis for use of AI and transformed customer experiences going forward.\nRegarding the shared services, we are off to a good start, but we have just started in this area. A new shared services hub in Portugal has been established, and we are now lifting transactional activities within finance, enterprise IT and HR functions into a common Nordic organization. We have captured so far this year around NOK 100 million in OpEx savings. And we have a full year ambitions of almost NOK 200 million for this year. We plan for this effect to ramp up significantly in the coming years.\nIn the commercial area, unified Nordic organizations have been set up and within TV, managed services and also large enterprise sales. This will be a key area for us both to capture cost efficiencies, but also to enhance the customer experience over time.\nAnd the fourth area on the working capital. As mentioned last quarter, we have a common program in place focused on improving capital tie-up. This program has already started to yield some results, and Kasper will come back to that later.\nSo I will say we have taken a systematic approach to structuring and executing these initiatives, which will yield progressive benefits over the medium and beyond. And as you can see from this illustration on the left-hand side of the slide, we have the road map of both short-term and long-term initiatives. The majority part of the impact in the beginning is coming from the four individual business units. But over time, more impact will also be generated from the common Nordic activities.\nThe continued modernization and digitalization of the way we work have also led to FTE reductions, averaging 4% in the Nordics over the last 8 years. And as an example, we reduced FTEs by 8% in Norway last year. Given the scope of the transformation efforts we now are currently doing, I expect that the level of workforce optimization in the years ahead will be at least on the level that we have seen historically.\nSo [ want ] to take all this together, how will this affect our OpEx? Well, for several quarters now, we have been very clear on our ambition of having a stable OpEx for 2024 and then a reduction going into 2025. However, as I mentioned initially, we have now delivered yet another quarter with flat OpEx in the Nordics. And we see additional effects from the transformation will come in later this year. We do, therefore, expect now to see a slight reduction in OpEx that could be reached already within this year.\nThen moving to Asia. In the last quarterly report, True reported a continued pickup in growth and synergy realizations. We are even more confident now that we will receive payment of dividends from True in 2025. Celcom Digi is also well on track with synergy realization and the company recently announced that around 50% of the new integrated and modernized network has been completed. This is on plan. This being said, I see room for further financial improvements in Malaysia, especially on the revenue growth. And we also expect a transparent process for the dual 5G network structure, the Malaysian authorities have initiated.\nMoving to Bangladesh. In Grameenphone, we had, I would call a relatively slow start of the year. However, growth is now slowly picking up, and I do expect an improved performance into the second half of the year. Although the country was severely hit by extreme weather in the second quarter, Grameenphone added 2.3 million customers during the quarter. We also expect a closing of our Pakistan divestment towards the end of the year, although there is some uncertainty around the exact timing, which could also slide into 2025.\nAnd with this, I hand over to Kasper to take us through the financials.\n\nKasper Wold Kaarboe\n\nActing Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Sigve, and good morning, all. So we grew group service revenues by 4.5% and EBITDA by almost 4% in the second quarter. Group CapEx on sales was 15%, while we generated NOK 2.2 billion in free cash flow, adding up to NOK 5.5 billion year-to-date before M&A. I'm happy that we once again are able to report a set of numbers that supports our medium-term ambitions.\nLet's take a closer look at how we are performing at the group level. In Q2, service revenue growth was quite in line with the trend from recent quarters. Nordics is the main driver of growth due to size, but Asia also contributes with more than 6% growth.\nThen let's take a look at group operating expenses. OpEx was up 3.7% year-over-year on the back of continued energy cost increases in Asia, which reached 25% this quarter. Higher energy tariffs in Pakistan continues to be the main issue. We saw a broad-based increase in sales and marketing expenses after a bit [ of a light ] first quarter. On an overall region level, Nordics continued to deliver on flat OpEx, which they also did in Q1. The mentioned increase in sales and marketing expenses were offset by continued strong performance on the operations and maintenance side due to our operational efficiency and technology agenda.\nMoving to group EBITDA. We continue to see Nordics being the main contributor with 4% organic growth. Asia's EBITDA growth was held back by inflation, particularly in Pakistan as well as growth costs this quarter, while infrastructure was stable. The soft trend in Amp continues, causing a 0.8 percentage points drag on the group level. Amp is facing gross margin headwinds and growth cost in several business units. While we expect a similar EBITDA in Amp in the second half of the year compared to the first, I expect a relative drag on the group growth to diminish over the next few quarters.\nLastly, we see that [ other and elaborations ] had an unusually large contribution this quarter. This is mainly explained by increased revenues coming from Telenor Procurement Company now also providing service to Celcom Digi and True. This sums up to an overall growth of 3.8% for the group.\nStopping further in on the Nordics, where we see solid top line performance across all business units. The growth of 3.7% was mainly driven by consumer mobile and ARPU growth coming from our more for more price increase execution. G&A was again the main contributor to the top line growth, delivering another strong quarter and mobile service revenue growth of 10%. In general, we see that the small and [indiscernible] segment as a contributor to the growth within B2B. However, we see increasing competition within the large enterprise and public segment in Scandinavia, with some ARPU erosion in the quarter.\nThat being said, as we heard Sigve mentioning, we are establishing a common Nordic B2B [ product efforts ] and sales organization. This will strengthen our resource pool and ensure that we are commercially set up to meet the demand of large enterprises. All this led to an EBITDA growth of 4% this quarter. As you can see, the strong top line results in D&A trickles through to EBITDA, given modest cost growth and fueling an EBITDA growth of 9%. In addition, Denmark posted 10% growth. However, note that this was largely due to improved gross margin following the lower handset sales and somewhat lower energy costs.\nThen a few words on Asia. Overall, we continue to see progress on growth in Asia as well as on the synergy realization in the two associated companies that are a result of two large mergers in '22 and '23. We continue to see headwinds from energy [ subsequents ] in Grameenphone and Telenor Pakistan, in line with what we talked about in previous calls this year. Inflation remains an issue in these markets. Grameenphone grew its customer base nicely in Q2. The performance was held back by energy outages relating to the cyclone [ Ramal ] and increased supplementary duty. EBITDA grew only by 1.5% due to a bit of a catch-up effect on cost inflation in Pakistan, following two years of high price growth in the country.\nIn Bangladesh, full effect of lower energy subsidies in Q1 and increased costs relating to the solid supply growth of [ 2.3 million ] weighted on EBITDA. As to our associated companies, which we report with one quarter lag, we were quite pleased with True, which saw continued strong effects from its synergy and integration [indiscernible] as well as a nice return to top line growth in Q1. With EBITDA growth of 21%, [ I see ] True as well placed to deliver on this ambitious full year and medium-term goals.\nFor Celcom Digi, the dividend continues to be paid on a quarterly basis. As for performance, we expect the company to work actively on revenue growth and get improving net benefits of the synergies post integration costs going forward.\nNext, let me highlight the most notable items affecting the profit and loss statement as well as our balance sheet and cash flows. Looking at the P&L, we have a quite clean quarter with only a few items to comment on. The EBITDA before other income and expenses landed at [ NOK 8.8 billion in ] Q2. On the net financial income and expense line, we have a loss of NOK 0.4 billion this quarter. This was positively impacted by a change in the fair value of the funding arrangement related to the indirect part of our investment in True Corporation, which had a strong share price development in the quarter. For the same reason, we saw an impairment on the second quarter last year, which was also affected by interest costs related to the legal disputes in Bangladesh.\nEarnings per share [indiscernible] at NOK 1.83 this quarter, which is more than 3x higher than for the comparable period last year when EPS was unusually low. With our Nordic transformation and synergy benefits in our Asian associates, set to have significant effect over time, we continue working to improve also this metric going forward.\nWe generated free cash flow of NOK 5.5 billion in the first half of the year, [indiscernible] NOK 2.2 billion in the second quarter. Although we will still see variations between quarters also going forward, we continue to work to obtain a more balanced cash flow profile through the year. As we talked about last time, we have seasonally higher interest payments in Q2 and Q4 and lower in the two other quarters.\nOn the working capital side, we saw a NOK 0.8 billion improvement in the quarter with around 1/4 of this coming from third-party handset financing and some net structural improvements. But the majority is other timing effects with some major payments happening in July rather than June. We also saw later unusual CapEx payments where there was a [ silver phasing ] into Q3. Of course, it's hard to know precisely how much as [ interior there ] could be similar effects towards the end of Q3.\nOn [ Spectrum ], we paid NOK 0.5 billion in Pakistan, and some smaller payments in Bangladesh and Denmark. There was a minority leakage of NOK 0.7 billion in Bangladesh as we repatriated about 50% of the 2023 net profits as dividends in Q2. [indiscernible] for Q3, Grameenphone has declared interim dividend of close to 100% of its net profit for the first half of 2024. This will cause our total cash outflow, NOK 1 billion in the third quarter. This sums up to the total of NOK 2.2 billion in free cash flow.\nThe balance sheet of the group remains strong with NOK 83 billion in net interest-bearing debt and a net leverage ratio of 2.3x. Leverage was impacted by the payment of NOK 6.9 billion in dividend and the completion of the 2023 share buyback program, where we bought back the government's portion amounting to NOK 1.9 billion and canceled 31 million shares.\nOn the other hand, we saw a favorable FX impact of NOK 2.3 billion on the net debt due to the NOK strengthening quarter-over-quarter and the NOK 2.2 billion free cash flow generation we talked about. As always, macro FX and seasonality factors can lead to a net leverage fluctuations between quarters, including to a level above the leverage range has happened in Q2 last year.\nThis brings us to the financial outlook. After a solid first half, we remain confident in our overall outlook. Based on [indiscernible] revenue growth of 4.5% for the full period, we slightly raised our 2024 service revenue outlook to low to mid-single-digit growth from low single digits previously. This being said, we do expect the continued tapering of service revenue growth in the Nordics with lower year-over-year numbers in the second half as we meet tougher comparables.\nWe reconfirm the other elements of the 2024 outlook as well as the midterm financial ambition that we provided at the Capital Markets Day almost two years back. We continue to expect mid-single-digit EBITDA growth for the group despite continued headwinds in Amp as we expect performance [indiscernible] improved in the second half. On free cash flow, we reiterate the NOK 9 billion to NOK 10 billion target. This despite the announced interim dividends in Grameenphone that I mentioned earlier. We repatriate dividends early, leading to a near NOK 1 billion minority leakage that we did not have last year and which was not in the original outlook assumptions.\nWith that, I hand over to you, Sigve, for some concluding remarks.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nYes. Thank you, Kasper. And I just would like to conclude with [indiscernible] things. First, we continue to deliver constantly in line with our strategy. In our operational and financial performance is the proof point that our strategy really works. And based on this, we also continue to deliver on both our growth ambition and the ambition of increased cash flow.\nSecond, despite changes in [ management ], the whole organization is systematically working to deliver on our strategy and to meet our financial targets. This is also backed by our Board of Directors.\nAnd thirdly, we have [indiscernible] last year, worked successfully on transforming Telenor for the future. I think it's fair to say that we have a solid track record for CapEx discipline and OpEx reduction. And the ongoing Nordic transformation is another proof point of our focused approach and execution capabilities. This is now also coupled with a continued top line growth in the Nordics, which is a solid foundation for a stronger company with a better customer experiences and services and a significant leaner cost structure.\nSo with that Kasper, I think we are ready for questions. Operator, please let in the first question."

I'm Frank Maao, Head of Investor Relations at Telenor. And with me today, I have Sigve Brekke, our CEO; and our CFO, Tone Hegland Bachke.\nI would like to note that within today's presentation, references to growth rates will be as usual on an organic like-for-like currency basis. On today's agenda, we'll kick off with Sigve's highlights of the quarter and then update on the progress in 3 of our business areas. Next, Tone will go through our financial results and outlook, before Sigve sums it all up. Then finally, as always, we will open up for questions.\nThen let me turn it over to Sigve.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nYes. Thank you, Frank. And a very good morning to everyone. I am very pleased with our performance in this first quarter. We deliver high and profitable growth. We deliver a strong cash flow, and we continue to execute on a strategy that works. At the Capital Markets Day back in 2022, we set out to reshape Telenor. And we outlined both the direction for operations, for organization, and the way we are looking at ownership, together with our financial ambitions through 2025. We are now halfway there in the strategy period, and the results we are announcing today are another demonstration that we are on track to reach our ambitions.\nWe are showing strong and profitable growth in the Nordics with actually now all the business units in the Nordics contributing to both revenue and EBITDA growth. And in Asia, the synergies are beginning to come true, both in Malaysia and in Thailand. Together, this will give us a strong foundation for our long-term value creation. In Q1, we grew our service revenues with 6%. We achieved a 7% EBITDA growth. And in addition, we generated total free cash flow of NOK 5.4 billion in the quarter. We did this by driving revenue growth and cost discipline in the Nordics and through our cash flow focus in Asia. The Nordic operation delivered even stronger numbers in the first quarter than what we had expected. And in Asia, we are ahead of our plans in synergy realization in the 2 merged entities. With this, we are well on track with our full year and mid-term financial ambitions.\nNow, let me zoom in on the Nordics, our biggest contributor to the group top line and EBITDA growth, and you see that on this slide. Nordics had a very strong start of the year. Our ambition in this region is to generate profitable growth and focus on revenue, market share, and capital returns. And Q1 was just another quarter, where we delivered mobile service revenue growth at or in this quarter even above the 5% level you have seen now several quarters in a row. But this time, we also delivered a 5% total service revenue growth. We achieved this by monetizing on our strong networks and service capabilities through our more-for-more pricing strategy. This approach that we've talked about now for several quarters is how we do pricing adjustments.\nIt's enabled by our continued focus on improving the customer experience and meeting our customers' communication and service needs. For example, in the first quarter alone, we have stopped more than 0.5 billion attempts or digital criminal activities for our customers in Norway alone. We have taken then a leading security position in the Norwegian market in addition to the network position that we already had, and we continue now to see increased demand for security-related services. The benefits of having world-class network were also visible on the cost side as we were able to bring down fault handling costs quite substantially in Norway.\nIn addition, we benefit now from a very strong cost discipline across the Nordic businesses. These factors contribute to a flat OpEx, enabling us to reach an EBITDA growth of 8% in the quarter. As we now are executing on our transformation programs, the focus is on common Nordic shared services, common Nordic network and IT operations, and we have also started to address the commercial area, in particular the B2B segment. However, the performance you see in this quarter is driven by the momentum we had from efficiency measures we took in 2023 in addition to overall cost discipline and some timing effects. There are also some positive regulatory news from Norway in this quarter, I will say finally.\nOn the fixed side, the regulator's updated position and analysis suggest further deregulation for our cyber business in Norway. And on the mobile side, the regulator communicated the first step into what we hope will be a full deregulation of the wholesale market within the coming 3 years, after 20 years now of heavy regulations. So while the first quarter was indeed a good one in the Nordics, I'm even more happy about our tractions on the transformation program, which is building a strong foundation for where we will be in the medium term and at the end of this decade. I'm convinced that our agenda for cross-regional synergies evolving towards a cloud-native technology stack, as well as using AI to completely change our customer journeys will be a foundation for long-term performance.\nThis brings me to our digital infrastructure. To succeed with our transformation, we need to continue our development to become a digital cloud-based and AI-enhanced telecom. To do this, we have to rely on public cloud partners for many IT workloads. Some of the more critical and sensitive workload server will require a different setup with sovereign cloud governance. In practice, this means that data processing and storage will need to be done on local soil with a high degree of security and sovereign control. To do -- to meet this, we need a modern, green and secure data center as a foundation. We have, therefore, formed a joint venture named Skygard together with 2 other Norwegian-owned partners.\nThe plan is to launch the first out of 3 data centers in the Oslo regions during the first half of 2025. Skygard has strong focus on energy-efficient operations and meeting customers' high security and sovereignty requirements. It is estimated that the modern data centers will reduce energy requirements with up to 50% when compared to traditional ones. Furthermore, surplus heat from the new data centers can be utilized into the district's heating network. You may ask, why should Telenor do this? What is our edge in this business? Well, I firmly believe that Telenor's ownership, the scale of our business, the workloads we bring, as well as the competence and trust we have, provide us with a competitive edge in the sovereign data center market.\nThe data centers we are building will have only Norwegian owners, will be governed by the Norwegian Security Law and fulfill sovereign requirements. This is why we announced also our AI collaboration with NVIDIA in March this year. We will bring in their cutting-edge technology into our data centers. AI and cloud solutions built on the NVIDIA ecosystem as well as technology from other partners will be the cornerstone of Telenor Nordics transformation program going forward.\nThen let me turn to Asia. Our associated company, True in Thailand posted a strong fourth quarter report in February. As they stated in their report, True is on an accelerated track with regards to capturing merger integration benefits. Synergy momentum enabled True to provide a 2024 outlook of 9% to 11% EBITDA growth and a positive normalized net profit, which was previously indicated for next year. This is also supported by growth now coming from the return of tourists to Thailand and from a more rational market. All of this support our ambition for True to resume dividend payment into 2025.\nCelcomDigi in Malaysia has communicated a progressive dividend policy in line with the ambitions when we close this merger. As a result of that, we continue to receive quarterly dividends as we also did in this quarter from CelcomDigi. And on the sustainability side, we are pleased to see both True and CelcomDigi's commitment to setting a long-term net zero emission targets, supporting Telenor's overall ambition. Grameenphone in Bangladesh. In the country, we see an improvement in the political stability following the January election. We will continue our efforts to mitigate political and macro risks going forward.\nEBITDA growth in Grameenphone in Q1 was held back by rise in energy costs that take away some of the subsidies, which will expect -- we -- which we expect will remain a headwind also for the remainder of 2024. While Grameenphone grew positively in the quarter, I also believe that potential is even higher. And I expect the company's performance to improve now that the political and economic environment is more stable. Finally, as you know from our strategic review of Telenor Pakistan, we have concluded with an exit. While the divestment process is ongoing, I continue to be very impressed with the management teams and their ability to not only carry on business as usual, but keep improving already strong operational and financial performance in a very challenging market.\nAnd summing up in Asia, our focus is synergy realization and cash repatriation. I believe we are well on track to deliver the NOK 5 billion in free cash flow from Asia in 2025, in line with what we said at our Capital Markets Day.\nAnd with that, I hand over to Tone.\n\nTone Hegland Bachke\n\nExecutive VP, Group CFO & Head of Group Treasury, Telenor ASA\n\nThank you, Sigve, and good morning, everyone. This quarter represents a strong start to the year. The financials we deliver for Q1 are supportive of the outlook we have provided for the year and our ambitions towards 2025. We now start to see that service revenue growth, gross margin improvements and tight operational execution flow through as operational leverage in our business. For the group, service revenues grew by 5.6%, and for EBITDA, the 6.9% growth was particularly supported by the OpEx discipline and strong results in the Nordic. Free cash flow before M&A ended at NOK 3.3 billion and NOK 5.4 billion when including the sale of Telenor Satellite.\nNow, let's start with taking a look at the 2 largest business areas. Starting with the Nordics, all 4 business units contributed positively to the service revenue growth of 5%. We also continued to generate strong growth in mobile service revenue, now reaching 7% coming from ARPU growth and despite that, we do see some subscriber headwinds in Norway and Denmark. DNA in Finland was the star performer this quarter, with mobile service revenue growth reaching the double digits and overall service revenues growing 9%. Growth across the region is the result of our more-for-more strategy and adding value to our subscription portfolios over the last years. B2C ARPU was the key contributor across the Nordics, but also in Sweden, we see net adds on the B2B side leading to noteworthy growth. Based on the revenue growth, improved gross margin and OpEx discipline, Nordic EBITDA grew 8.3%.\nWe work systematically with identifying and realizing improvement opportunities for both the fixed and the variable parts of the cost base. A couple of words on the gross margin, which was up 3.3 percentage points year-over-year. The improvement is partially explained by lower handset sales. It's also lower energy cost, but also a wider improvement agenda in the Nordics. Finally, the more-for-more strategy also has an accretive impact. The EBITDA expansion in the quarter was somewhat helped by easy comps in Denmark and some energy tailwind. The PPA in Norway, the energy agreement, as we talked about before, came in from the month of March this year. The overall EBITDA trend is positive and still EBITDA in the mid-single-digit even if we adjust for these single elements.\nAgain, DNA had the most significant contribution to the EBITDA in the Nordics with their 16% growth. They did this through the powerful combination of generating double-digit mobile service revenue growth, combined with limited OpEx growth. It's also worth noticing our Danish operation, which continues to deliver impressive results in a very challenging market.\nMoving from Nordics to our consolidated businesses in Asia. As for the performance in Grameenphone and Telenor Pakistan, organic service revenues grew 6%. While data continues to be a significant growth driver in this region, its impact of growth has diminished somewhat compared to previous quarters. However, going forward, data growth increasing the subscriber base and ARPU continue to be important levers for us. EBITDA grew 5.3% and was negatively affected by the OpEx increase from energy price hikes.\nThen moving to the group level. We see that service revenues remain on a positive trend from the 3% growth we saw in Q1 last year to the nearly 6% growth we see this quarter. Nordics remain the main contributor to the group, but Asia is also contributing solidly with their 6% growth. Then a quick look at group costs. Telenor Nordics delivered a flat OpEx in Q1 on the back of the new Nordic operating model. Three main elements are contributing to this. First, we see full effect of cost efficiencies and FTE reductions made through 2023. Second, we had lower fault handling costs in Norway. And third, the general cost discipline was strong. And finally, there was also an element of temporarily lower marketing costs due to the timing of the launch of our new mobile subscription portfolio in Norway in the quarter.\nAnd we expect market spending from an overall basis to normalize in the current quarter. The group OpEx was up 4%, [ affected ] by 25% increase in energy costs, driven by Asia, where energy is, as you know, booked on the OpEx line. About 75% of this energy cost increase was related to higher energy tariffs in Pakistan. Solid top line growth across the businesses of the group, coupled with strong management of both fixed and variable costs, led to the EBITDA growth of 6.9%.\nNext, let me highlight the most notable items affecting the P&L, leverage and cash flow before I move to the outlook. Reported EBITDA closed at NOK 9.8 billion, an increase of NOK 1.9 billion from last quarter. The main contributor to this nominal growth is the gain from the sale of Telenor Satellite of nearly NOK 1.4 billion. This is booked under other income and expenses, and then for the avoidance of doubt, this is excluded from the EBITDA boi figure we focus on throughout this presentation. On the associated companies line, there is a NOK 7 billion positive effect related to True and reversal of close to the entire impairment we made in Q4. This is based on the share price of True Corporation as per the end of the first quarter.\nIn addition to this, on the net financials line, we booked another reversal related to True and a fair value adjustment of the joint venture shareholder loan amounting to NOK 1 billion. Following this, there will not be any adjustment to the carrying amount of our direct ownership in True besides the quarterly net results unless there is a significant or prolonged decline in the share price of True. As such, it will only be going forward, the shareholder loan that will be on a quarterly mark-to-market valuation in our books from here on. And please refer to Note 4 in our report for further details on this. The balance sheet of the group remains strong with NOK 79 billion in net interest-bearing debt and a net leverage of 2.2x. The leverage ratio will continue to be subject to fluctuation between quarters caused by macro factors such as FX volatility and also cash flow fluctuation. In addition, our leverage will be affected by the semi-yearly dividend payments.\nAlso, during the summer, we will complete the government's portion of the 2023 share [ buyback ] program, amounting to NOK 1.9 billion. All these factors could lead to leverage fluctuation between quarters like we saw in the second quarter last year. Staying on the cash flow topic, in Q1, we generated a strong free cash flow of NOK 5.4 billion, of which NOK 3.3 billion was before M&A. We provide further cash flow details on this slide as you see.\nStarting with the EBITDA, the growth of 7% was a significant contributor to the improved cash flow. Our net working capital improved by NOK 7.9 billion, driven by structural improvements, somewhat favorable phasing effects and a minor portion of third-party handset financing. On the other side, paid CapEx was a bit high this quarter, where we had some spillover for the -- from the CapEx in the fourth quarter last year. On the topic of seasonality, interest paid was relatively low in Q1 due to quarterly differences in bond interest payments. Our regular interest payments related to bonds are typically around twice as high in Q2 and Q4 compared to the first and the third quarters.\nAs Sigve said, we continue to receive dividend from CelcomDigi in Malaysia on a quarterly basis, and in this quarter, we also received dividend from Allente. Contribution from M&A was mainly related to the sale of Telenor Satellite. All in all, we deliver yet a quarter with solid free cash flow, both organically and including M&A. We expect fluctuations in free cash flow between quarters, although not as pronounced as we experienced last year. For example, in Q2, we do expect some periodic payment related to net interest, as I just mentioned, spectrum in Pakistan, and licenses and minority dividends in Grameenphone.\nAs a reminder, this year we might also be faced with late payments related to the legacy cases we settled in Bangladesh last year. These numbers, as we have said before, could be quite significant and are, as you already know, not included in our free cash flow outlook for the year and the target range we gave last quarter.\nThis brings us to the outlook for the year. The year started on a strong note for us, perhaps even stronger than we had expected 3 months ago. This makes us even more confident in the 2024 outlook we provided last quarter. That said, we will likely continue to see variation between quarters, not only on free cash flow, but maybe also on service revenue and EBITDA growth. We make no changes to the 2024 guidance. In the Nordics, we keep the low single-digit service revenue outlook and mid-single-digit EBITDA outlook. And although CapEx was on the low side in Q1, we still expect 2024 to be a year of significant investments at around 17% of sales.\nOn the group level, we also maintain our mid-single-digit EBITDA outlook, as well as our free cash flow ambitions for 2024. As this is my final quarter as Telenor's CFO, I'm glad to say that I'm leaving a company that is well on course to deliver on the strategy and fulfill the ambitions we communicated in September 2022, and also a company that is in good shape to continue to create value both for customers, shareholders, and the society [ a lot ].\nThank you. And with that, Sigve, I hand the word back to you for some concluding remarks.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nThank you, Tone, and it was well said in the end there. You are definitely leaving a position in a very strong company. And I think that also rewards some few comments in the end here. Like you said, this year has started on a good foot and we are in a good shape.\nAnd summing up, I will say that I am impressed by the Nordics' ability to push revenue growth, while keeping OpEx flat. We have talked you through the main drivers for the quarter and we intend to get back to you on how we are working with the transformational activities in the Nordics when we come to our Q2 call. And in Asia, we are on track with the synergy realization and cash flow focus. The synergy momentum and growth potential in True even exceeds our expectations. And as I said, in Grameenphone, we see potential for a step-up in performance in the coming quarters.\nLike we said in the beginning, we are now executing on a strategy that works. We believe there is more to come as our ambitious transformation agenda, particularly in the Nordics, will make Telenor a more technology-driven, a leaner, and more capital-efficient company.\nSo with those concluding remarks, Tone, I think we should open up for questions.\n\nTone Hegland Bachke\n\nExecutive VP, Group CFO & Head of Group Treasury, Telenor ASA\n\nYes.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nYes, please, operator."

I'm Frank Maao, Head of Investor Relations. And with me here today is Sigve Brekke and our CFO, Tone Hegland Bachke. In the interest of good housekeeping, I would like to note that within today's presentation references to growth rates will be organic, like-for-like currency basis. And please also note that both report and the presentation have been published on our website.\nAs for today's agenda, Sigve will provide an overview of our strategic and operational progress for the quarter, and Tone will present more details on our financial results. She will also give an update on our new guidance for 2024 and how we are tracking towards our mid-term outlook. After that, we'll open up the floor for questions.\nWithout further ado, I'll turn it over to Sigve.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nThank you, Frank, and a very good morning to everyone. This was another strong quarter for the Telenor Group, and I'm pleased to say that we continued to execute in line with our plan not only for 2023, but also now going into 2024. One of the highlights this year is the growth in Nordic mobile service revenues, where we have since the fourth quarter in 2022, posted 5 consecutive quarters with 5% underlying growth. The main driver of this has been our more for more price adjustments and the services, especially security services that we have put on top of connectivity across the Nordic region.\nThen to the other highlight, which is the quite comprehensive list of strategic M&A transactions we have executed in the last year. The focus has been to simplify the group, mitigate risk and to drive our value creation. We have completed the largest telecom merger ever in Southeast Asia in Thailand when we closed the merger there. We have announced the sale of Telenor Pakistan. We have monetized a minority stake of our Norwegian fiber network, and we have exited Working Group Two and Telenor Satellite, 2 of the companies in our Amp portfolio.\nThese transactions have demanded strong efforts and significant work in many teams across Telenor. I would like to extend a big thank you to all our employees that have been a part of delivering this impressive M&A agenda.\nAnd as you see on the slide, we exceeded our cashflow ambitions with NOK 15 billion in total cashflow for the year. 2/3 of the NOK 15 billion cashflow comes from the organic growth and 1/3 comes from deal activities I just mentioned. And having a look back at the numbers, I see that it is actually the best fourth quarter in 10 years when it comes to the overall combination of revenue growth, EBITDA growth and the free cash flow.\nThis overview here brings us back to the Capital Markets Day we had in September 2022, and it illustrates where we now are in our execution of the strategy we laid out at the CMD. Overall, we believe we are well on track with the 2 years left of the targeted period.\nIn the Nordics, we show sound profitable growth in line with the outlook we provided for 2023. Still, we know we have room for further improvements and we are well underway in setting ourselves up for transformation and delivering on cross regional synergy areas. In Finland, DNA has shown strong financial performance in the quarter, actually the whole last year. Their operation was also recognized by achieving the Finnish Quality Award. In addition, they won the EPSI customer satisfaction award. In Norway, customers are enjoying, I think I want to call it, a fantastic mobile network with supreme coverage.\nIn Q4, we were happy to receive the award from the Ookla speed test for the fastest mobile network in the country for the sixth year in a row, and also the award for the best mobile network. It shows how important mobile coverage and a solid mobile network is for our customers in Norway.\nFor the Nordics, we have been able to keep OpEx growth well below inflation levels throughout the year, but we have not quite performed in line with the nominal reduction ambition we set at the CMD in '22 when inflation expectation were much lower. However, Norway has managed to keep OpEx flat in 2023 in a year where the inflation in Norway was around 5% to 6%. This year, we will further sharpen the cost focus both through Nordic level synergies and also country-specific transformation measures.\nInvestments in the Nordics will stay at an elevated level also in this year due to the regulatory commitments we have in Sweden. However, as said before, in 2025, I remain confident that CapEx will be NOK 2 billion lower versus what we had in 2022 as the Nordic network modernization rollouts start to taper off.\nAsia is also progressing according to the plan. What we have done is to improve industry structures with creation of 2 market leading players in Malaysia and in Thailand. This has bolstered our position, because going into partnership in these markets, setting up strong governance models and the conclusion of the existing -- the exiting and selling Telenor Pakistan have contributed to our goal of de-risking the Asian portfolio. We are now well-positioned and prepared to further explore and exploit strategic opportunities, and we call it optionalities for our future position in Asia.\nAt the Capital Markets Day, we communicated our focus on developing and extracting value from our infrastructure business. The fiber deal is now completed and the extensive work has been done in term of streamlining the tower business and setting ourself up to potentially crystallize the tower values we have in the Nordics.\nAnd when it comes to our fourth business area, Amp, this area has also gone through some material changing during the year in line with the strategy of develop or divest assets in the portfolio. We have this year completed the sale of Working Group Two and Telenor Satellite, and we continue to prioritize capital towards high-return activities.\nWe have done all this according to the sustainable business principles that we have, meeting key ESG targets and setting new ones. The execution of Scope 1 to 2 climate targets remains. They are a little bit challenging in Asia due to the shortage of available clean energy, but we have made solid progress here. We are tracking well in the Nordics and we are ahead of our Scope 3 targets here for the group.\nThen I would like to say a few words about how we are performing our business in Nordics and Asia, also the transformation that we have embarked on. In the Nordics, we are working on a transformation program that will yield tangible business benefits in the 4 synergy areas that you see on the left-hand side of this slide. I think I can say that we are already cutting edge in many aspects, but we still have legacy parts in our network and IT systems that need to be modernized.\nWe have duplication of activities across the 4 operating companies in the Nordics, and those duplications can be removed. And the potential to transform the customer experience by pooling our resources and deploying the latest technologies. To do this transformation, we see a significant potential to ramp up the use of not only advanced analytics, but also the experience we have in AI and machine learning and the investments we are now making into generative AI.\nIn the IT domain, we are accelerating our Cloud strategy, boosting the share of SaaS-based applications to 70% in 2024. In the network area, we still have a multi-year journey ahead of us, but we will double the Cloud-native workloads in '24, giving us a far better flexibility, scalability and simplicity.\nWe are accelerating the deployment of common back office functions. This year, our aim is to double the shared cost activity base to NOK 700 million. We already see significant savings, but this is only the start. We aim to deploy common data management analytics to drive efficiency through automation.\nIn the commercial area, we are moving towards common product launches across the Nordics, especially in the B2B segment, and being much more data-driven in how we approach customers in real time. And finally, we have launched a program of working capital initiatives that will deliver structural improvements and efficiencies in capital use.\nThese efforts will entail further right sizing of our business. Based on our transformation efforts, we are aiming for a flat OpEx for the Nordics in 2024 despite the inflationary environment, followed by a nominal OpEx reduction in 2025.\nThen moving to our transformation in Asia. We are now deep into the integration work of the 2 transformative transactions in our associated companies in Thailand and Malaysia. I see a potential of not only getting back to growth in these 2 markets after the market consolidations, but also to deliver on the large efficiency potential we have announced. These cost synergies come from unifying the network grids, revamping distribution and improving organizational structures.\nFor instance, in Thailand, we are supporting True in right sizing and future fitting the organization. I see a really large scale potential here. In Bangladesh, we will continue to focus on taking out the full growth potential while also growing cash flow. After our strategic review of Telenor Pakistan, as you know, we concluded that an exit through a sale to PTCL, the main owner of Ufone, was the best option. We expected this deal to close during the year.\nAll in all, I believe we are on track to what we said at the Capital Markets Day, where we talked about NOK 5 billion in free cashflow from Asia in 2025. We also said we would like to de-risk our positions and secure repetition of cash.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Tone.\n\nTone Hegland Bachke\n\nExecutive VP, Group CFO & Head of Group Treasury, Telenor ASA\n\nThank you Sigve, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a year of significant geopolitical, climatic and macroeconomic turbulence. Amid all this, I'm happy to say that Telenor's operations and key financials represented stable momentum.\nTop line revenue growth was 4%. EBITDA growth for the year was 3%, but actually well above 4% if we adjust for the non-cash reversal in Pakistan in the third quarter of '22. And then after a slow first half of the year when it comes to free cash flow, I'm pleased to report that we closed the year with a strong free cash flow of NOK 9.5 billion and totaling NOK 15 billion when including the M&A activities following the intense execution on our structural agenda.\nMoving to the fourth quarter, which represented a solid finish to the year. We grew top line service revenues with 5% with good results both in Nordics and in Asia. As to EBITDA, we also performed well with 4% growth. CapEx intensity was just below 15% this quarter and free cash flow for the quarter ended at a solid NOK 5 billion, which I will come back to more in detail.\nBut first, I will get more into the details of the development and key drivers, starting up with the group figures. Service revenues for the group has been on a good trend throughout the year with a strong finish in Q4 with 5% organic growth coming from 4% in the Nordics and 7.5% in Asia as the key contributors on group level.\nMoving to OpEx. Inflation and particularly energy in Asia continued to impact us both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. OpEx for the group increased by 5% both in the quarter and for the year. A key driver for the increase in Asia -- East Asia, which in Q4 was 17% and was impacted by higher energy costs and lower comparables last year in the fourth quarter in Grameenphone.\nIn the Nordics inflation in the region averaged around 6% in 2023, ranging from around 3% in Denmark and up to almost 9% in Sweden. This clearly affected our cost performance. However, our structural cost reduction efforts managed to offset a good part of this with OpEx coming up only 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. Two of the 4 business units in the Nordics actually had flat OpEx in 2023. In Norway, as we said, where inflation averaged 5% to 6% for the year, we managed to keep OpEx flat in '23 due to the transformational efforts. The Danish operation also continued to deliver well and had a flat OpEx during 2023.\nThis brings us to group EBITDA, which increased by 4% in the fourth quarter. Nordics was an important EBITDA growth contributor, growing with 5%, and so was Asia, growing by 4.4%. We had a relatively neutral impact from energy for the group year-on-year with approximately NOK 0.1 billion tailwind in the Nordics, offset by a similar headwind in Asia.\nAmp, our portfolio of non-core and adjacent businesses had a weakening trend throughout the year. The main driver of this was Telenor Linx, as I mentioned on our third quarter call. Coming from a strong 2022, we now see the voice and messaging business declining, with Linx also facing structural headwinds driven by technology changes.\nGoing forward, we continue to see profitable growth for Connexion, our IT company. On the associated assets, while we took impairments on Allente and Carousell, we continue to see sound development in our growth assets. Following these changes and developments, we expect a reset of the EBITDA and free cash flow levels of Amp in 2024.\nOn valuation on the Amp portfolio, we have now during this year confirmed the upper range of the end of the valuation range we gave at the CMD when we talked about the NOK 10 billion to NOK 15 billion. After taking out around NOK 4 billion in cash in 2023, we now estimate the value of the remaining portfolio in Amp to be in the area of NOK 10 billion.\nMoving to the Nordics part of our business. In the Nordics, growth in service revenue came at 3.8% for the quarter and 3.4% for the year. We have been able to maintain the 5% growth level on the mobile side for several quarters now. In fixed, service revenues have trended up as legacy headwinds diminished during the year, but growth was still muted at 1.2% in the fourth quarter.\nLooking at the country operations. DNA in Finland delivered another strong quarter with 9% mobile service revenue growth and Sweden contributed well with 4% growth in total service revenues in the fourth quarter. Going into 2024, we see constructive pricing moves in the Swedish market building on the positive moves in the low-end and mid-tier segments last year. Norway grew service revenue close to 3% overall.\nZooming further in on Norway, revenue growth has been in line with plan, as I showed on the previous slide. As to EBITDA and compared to a very strong previous quarter, Q4 is softer with a flat development.\nThe underlying growth on the chart to the right is adjusting for the typical swing factors we have been showing over several quarters, namely relating to the copper decommissioning headwind, energy cost and adjustments related to our B2C handset swap program, at 2% underlying growth in Q4 that was lower than the 5% underlying growth we saw in Q3. This is mainly explained by 2 things. Firstly, on the OpEx, we see a series of accruals and minor cost items adding up in the fourth quarter; and secondly, we saw some gross margin on the performance within device sales. We expect OpEx and handset margins performance to improve in 2024.\nWhile Norway's EBITDA trend over the last few quarter is encouraging, we still see some variability in the performance and continue to drive transformation and efficiency agenda. EBITDA growth in Nordics remained strong at 5% in the fourth quarter. Full year ended at 3.7% in line with the guiding. Although the growth is somewhat lower than the very strong previous quarter, we continue to see a positive trend in the Nordics.\nOur Finnish operation, DNA was the main contributor this quarter with 17% growth. This was helped by energy cost that fell by 25% year-over-year. However, and adjusted for this growth was still in the double digits. Both Sweden and Denmark also generated solid EBITDA growth in the quarter.\nNorway, Finland and Denmark were helped by lower energy cost this quarter. The PPAs we have entered into will remove some of the volatility related to energy cost in the Nordics and particularly this year as PPA in Norway and Denmark comes into effect during the year.\nThen moving to Asia. Let me start with Grameenphone and Telenor Pakistan, our consolidated businesses. Organic service revenue grew by 7.5% with increased data usage and price adjustments as the main growth drivers. EBITDA grew 4.4%. In Grameenphone, we see ARPU growth of 5.5% year-over-year due to price uplifts and data usage growth.\nAs said, we concluded a strategic review of Pakistan in December, where the decision to exit. The deal we announced in December with PTCL values Telenor Pakistan at NOK 5.3 billion on a cash and debt free basis. This includes repayment of intercompany loans of NOK 3.5 billion and reduced interest-bearing liabilities of NOK 1.8 billion, including leases. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary terms and conditions and is expected to close later this year, as we have said.\nWe continue to focus on free cash flow in Asia in line with our CMD ambition with dividend and CelcomDigi and True being important for our mid-term ambitions. CelcomDigi paid out an accretive dividend in 2023 in line with their progressive dividend commitment. We continue to have a positive outlook here for 2024 and onwards. For True, we are working to return to dividends as we go into 2025.\nNow, let's take a look at the key remaining financial topics for the group this quarter and at the year end. Starting with the P&L and looking at some of the elements below EBITDA, this quarter, we had some special items, mainly impairments that impacted our P&L. When we completed the merger of dtac and True in the first quarter of 2023, we booked a NOK 18.5 billion gain on the discontinued business line and the share price started trading at THB 8.15 per share. At the end of 2023, the share price stood at TBH 5.05.\nDue to the significant reduction in the share price, we have mark-to-market value of the True asset as we preannounced on Monday. In Q4, this led to an overall write down of NOK 8.7 billion, consisting of NOK 8 billion impairment on the associated company line and a fair value adjustment to the shareholder loan that is booked in net financial items.\nBased on this and going forward, we will continue to use the mark-to-market principle for the valuation of True in our books on a quarterly basis. This implies that there will be a positive or a negative impact on our books depending on True's share price development. As an example, if the current quarter were to close at yesterday's share price in True, there would have been a NOK 3.6 billion positive mark-to-market effect on the associated company level.\nFor the full year 2023, we had a net income to equity holders of Telenor ASA of NOK 13.7 billion equivalent to an earnings per share of NOK 9.9.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended 2023 with NOK 80 billion in net interest-bearing debt. Leverage ended at 2.2x EBITDA as for the previous quarter. I have previously talked about the various macro factors impacting our financial performance. We expect these macro elements to remain prevalent in 2024, and this is particularly relating to currency volatility in general and including the staggered availability of dollars and euros in Bangladesh, volatility in energy prices and subsidy levels in Bangladesh and Pakistan, and finally, we continue to see inflation and interest rates as key elements.\nMoving to free cash flow. We came out of 2023 with a solid free cash flow. In Q4, as I said, we generated NOK 5.5 billion. Of this amount, NOK 4.9 billion was generated organically with main drivers being EBITDA and a NOK 2.4 billion tax refund from the tax authorities, as we announced in November. Contribution was from M&A was NOK 0.6 billion from Working Group 2.\nCapEx was frontend-loaded in the year with also a small time phasing going into 2024. We paid more than NOK 500 million in spectrum CapEx with the main part relating to the auction in Sweden in September. We continue to receive steady quarterly dividends from CelcomDigi in Malaysia. All in all, we deliver a solid free cash flow.\nNow, moving to our outlook. I would like to start by revisiting what we stated at the Capital Markets Day in 2022 for the period from 2022 to 2025. As shown by the first 2 columns on this chart, when comparing to the actuals for '22 and '23, we did outperform our original free cash flow ambition, represented by the red dots, and we delivered a significant net contribution from M&A on top of this. We originally said that we expected a cashflow dip in 2023 due to the deconsolidation effects from dtac and Digi. In total, this represented a headwind of more than NOK 2 billion for the year.\nAlso going into last year, we talked about a somewhat steeper cashflow decline in 2023 as we outperformed our ambitions also in '22. Now, we see that '23 also came in above our expectation, partly supported by the mentioned NOK 2.4 billion in tax refund. But this was then offset by the NOK 1.7 billion special payments in Bangladesh in the second quarter and also the phasing and timing of the deconsolidation effects of dtac, which were above our estimates at the CMD.\nThis means that when we now look at 2024 and 2025, we believe we remain on track to our stated mid-term ambitions despite various moving parts since that ambition was laid out.\nThis brings us to the shareholder remuneration. Consistency and predictability is important for us when it comes to dividend. The proposed dividend is NOK 9.5 per share, which is in line with our policy to have a nominal increase in dividend per share. The proposal is, as always, subject to approval by the AGM in May and the payout is planned in 2 tranches of NOK 5 per share in May and NOK 4.5 per share in October of '24.\nIn addition to dividend, our shareholder remuneration also includes buybacks of NOK 3.7 billion, of which NOK 1.7 billion was bought in the open market last year and the rest will be bought back from the Norwegian state this summer as per our usual agreement.\nNow, I will take you through the outlook for 2024. For Telenor Norway, we expect low single digit growth in service revenues. Finland is expected to remain strong. We see encouraging signs in Sweden with regards to pricing, and we see a more nuanced market environment in Norway with somewhat tougher competition in the price sensitive segment. We expect mid-single digit organic growth in Nordic EBITDA. The outlook is supported by a flat OpEx ambition for the Nordics in '24 despite the inflationary environment.\nAs Sigve said, for 2025, we expect a slight nominal decrease in OpEx in the Nordics. This is an update from our earlier ambition of net OpEx reduction in Nordics by a CAGR of 1% to 3% from '23 to '25. This is in the context of the fairly significant higher than expected inflation compared to our original planning assumption.\nThe effect of the planned transformation measures in the Nordic will likely be somewhat backend-loaded in the year, setting us up with good speed into 2025. We expect Nordic CapEx to sales ratio to remain around 17%, same as for '23. For the group, we guide for mid-single digit EBITDA growth in '24, supported by the Nordics and good operating trends in Asia and infrastructure.\nAmp's earnings will be impacted by the recent exits, tempered with Linx facing both temporary and structural headwinds. Finally, we expect to deliver a free cash flow before M&A of NOK 9 billion to NOK 10 billion in 2024. Note that this range does not factor in potential typical one-off items related to prior year's activities such as the previously mentioned late payments in Bangladesh. And also note that Satellite is no longer included.\nThe free cash flow for 2023 with this definition would have been a bit north of NOK 8 billion. As such, we are on track towards our 2025 ambition of covering our nominal dividend per share by free cash flows.\nGoing forward, the key building blocks to reaching these targets are continued mid-single digit EBITDA growth for Nordics. This will be supported by top line growth and a nominal slight decrease in 2025 in OpEx; then there is the NOK 2 billion lower CapEx for the Nordics in 2025 versus 2022; and finally, on Nordics, cash flow from our structural working capital initiatives. In Asia, we expect growth in free cash flow from GP and we expect ramping up of synergies and dividends from our associates.\nWith that, Sigve, I believe we are ready for questions."

Yu\n\nSenior VP & PLDT Group Controller\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll be presenting the financial and operating highlights for the first 9 months of 2023.\nService revenues of PHP 142.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2023, were higher by 1% compared to the same period last year. On gross basis, service revenues of PHP 149.8 billion were up 3% from PHP 145.7 billion in 2022. Operating expenses decreased by 3% or PHP 1.7 billion to PHP 63.9 billion. Consolidated EBITDA rose by 4% to PHP 78.4 billion, an all-time 9-month high with EBITDA margin at 52%. Telco core income, excluding the impact of asset sales and Maya, grew to PHP 26.1 billion, up 2% year-on-year.\nNext page. On a segment basis, revenue growth was broad-based. Individual revenues representing about 43% of consolidated revenues rose 1% to PHP 60.6 billion. Record highs were adjusted in the Home and Enterprise segments. Home revenues rose 2% to PHP 45.3 billion, with Fiber Only revenues having risen 10% to PHP 39.3 billion. Home revenues -- our Enterprise business grew by 1% to PHP 34.8 billion.\nLet me now go through the segments in greater detail. Next, please. Home Broadband revenues grew by 2%, Fiber Only revenues, which now account for 87 total Home revenues, were higher by 10% or PHP 3.6 billion compared to the same period last year. As a result, across our installation plus migration and low churn, Fiber net adds re-accelerated in the third quarter with 81,000, compared to 42,000 in the second quarter, bringing the total net adds for the year to 210,000.\nThe gross of our Fiber Only revenues and the sequential albeit modest improvement of revenues from our fixed wireless broadband business, underscore our view that the home broadband market remains underpenetrated, we can serve demand more at the lower market segments that's more sensitive to pricing. Unique to PLDT is the ability to complement our fiber offer with others, at different price points, using varied fixed and wireless technologies to address market affordability. PLDT continues to enjoy strong brand equity and superior network quality, making it a formidable competitor in the market.\nNext, please. Data and ICT remain the key drivers of our enterprise business, which registered a revenue increase of 1% to PHP 34.8 billion from the same period last year, with third quarter revenues up by 2%. Corporate data grew by 6% due to higher fiber and managed IT data revenues. ePLDT recorded a 10% increase in revenues mainly from data center and cloud services.\nWith the sample data center capacity expected to come on stream ahead of competition in the first half in '24, ePLDT is well positioned -- actually the robust demand from hyperscalers. In addition, our growth pipeline is fueled by our enterprise team's focus on enabling digital transformation of corporate SMEs and government, through the creation of smart cities and the first sovereign cloud.\nNext, please. Positive trends are also manifesting in the individual segment which has faced various challenges over the years. Revenue for our individual business rose by 1% in the first 9 months of the year. In the third quarter, which is historically low, revenues were higher by PHP 100 million versus quarter, and PHP 400 million higher than the same quarter in 2022. 2% and 6% growth in prepaid and postpaid revenues in the third quarter supported [indiscernible] revenue implements compared to last year.\nMobile data revenues jumped PHP 52.4 billion, with active data users of almost 38 million and following a 15% price in data traffic. Average monthly data usage per customer escalated to 10.8 gigabytes, up by 23% from last year and 17% from full year 2022.\nWhile the industry availments of number portability remains small since the implementation of MNP in 2020, the majority of customers that ported their numbers, moved to smart, reflecting recognition of PLDT's network advantage.\nNext please. In the first 9 months of 2023, 82% of our consolidated service revenues were from data and broadband. By service type, mobile data rose by 3% year-on-year while broadband and corporate data grew by 4% and 6%, respectively. ICT revenues were up 10%, including an 8% price in data center revenues. Our broad-based cost management effort -- next, please -- was undertaken, resulting in a 3% or PHP 1.7 billion in total expenses, including provisions and subsidies. The combined impact of increase in revenues and decline in costs, is a 4% rise in consolidated EBITDA to PHP 78.4 billion, a 9-month record high, with margin up 52%.\nNext, please. Telco core income for the period grew by 2% to PHP 26.1 billion year-on-year, reflecting the impact of higher EBITDA, partly offset by higher depreciation, higher financing costs and higher tax provision. Telco core for the third quarter is stable compared to the same quarter last year.\nNext, please. On a reported basis, PLDT income grew by 1% to PHP 27.9 billion, mainly from the gain from the tower sale and leaseback transactions, ForEx and derivative gains, partly offset by MRP costs. Note that our share in losses from Maya stood at PHP 1.7 billion, lower than the PHP 2.4 billion reported last year. This moderation in losses is in line with the expectation of breakeven and profitability towards the end of 2024.\nNext, please. PLDT's balance sheet remains healthy. With net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of September at 2.44x, lower than the 2.48x at the end of June. We expect this to further improve with the receipt of the remaining tower sales proceeds. Gross debt amounted to PHP 274.5 billion, of which 15% are dollar denominated and 5% unhedged. Interest costs for the period stood at 4.49% pretax, while the average life of debt is 6.7 years.\nNext please. Total CapEx for 9 months amounted to PHP 55.3 billion, consisting of network and IT CapEx of PHP 49.4 billion, and business CapEx of PHP 6 billion. In line with our objective of bringing down CapEx and aiming for positive free cash flow, CapEx intensity for the period has fallen below the 40% mark to 37%, and is lower than the 46% recorded last year.\nIn addition, the CapEx of PHP 55.3 billion is PHP 23.1 billion lower than EBITDA for the period of PHP 78.4 billion. We maintain our CapEx guidance for the year of between PHP 80 billion and PHP 85 billion. This includes approximately about PHP 11 billion out of the PHP 33 billion prior year's commitment.\nWe continue to tightly screen and closely monitor our CapEx, especially multiyear projects, as well as introduce end-to-end process improvements in the value chain covering plan-to-budget approval, procure to pay, build provision and related record to report.\nNext page, please. This page shows the usual network highlights. On the fixed network, we passed 17.3 million homes and cover about 18,100 barangays representing 43% of the total barangays in the Philippines. Total fiber ports grew to 1 -- to 6.2 million, as we have accelerated port rollout. We continue to carefully rationalize the rollout of the ports to ensure optimal utilization.\nPLDT total fiber footprint remains unparalleled, with a total of over 1.1 million kilometers. Population coverage of our wireless network stands at 97%, about 82% of the total handsets on the network are LTE or 4G.\nNext page, please. The number of unique 5G devices and 5G data traffic continue to register improvements from the end of 2022. As part of our network optimization to realize operational CapEx and spectrum efficiencies, we reduced the number of our 5G base stations. Nevertheless, our 5G speed remain faster than that of competition based on Ookla's speed test. Let me...\n\nShailesh Baidwan\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Danny. So in 2023, we continue to push the boundaries of our FinTech ecosystem with Maya Digital Bank at the heart of it, and continue to launch new products and growing all our businesses.\nSo in the Philippines, we are the #1 digital bank in terms of number of depositors and the deposit balance, and we continue to see very good growth across our loans portfolio, and I'll touch upon that.\nOn the merchant acquiring business, which is where we process Visa, Mastercard to our PH domestic debit. Again, we are the leaders in number of transactions processed in the Philippines across all these various fund sources, and continue to see that market share expand. And we are the #1 finance app in the Philippines, which is our Maya consumer app.\nSo let me give a little more color across each of these. So if we look at, on the Maya consumer app, which was largely a payment-centric app and now has gone on and evolve into an all-in-one full financial service app for consumers. We introduced a high-engagement saving product, last year. Customers look forward at the start of the month to pay the electricity bill, to pay various utility bills, to do their various purchases, which then helps them to earn higher interest rate.\nAnd the bulk of that information that we are able to collect on customers, we are able to create better profiles and deeper understanding of the behavior, which then goes into our credit scoring models and allows us to provide them with our credit products as and when they need those.\nVery pleased, we have launched our first credit product last year, Maya Credit. And last month, we expanded that with a longer tenure product, Maya Personal Loans. And we've seen extremely positive take-up of that in the early stages of its launch. We continue to expand our services by adding on investments. So now customers are able to purchase and invest in a number of funds, and we will add the ability to purchase individual stocks on the Philippines Stock Exchange over the coming weeks.\nSo what this has enabled is, really helped the Maya consumer app to become the all-in-one primary financial services app for the customers, and we are seeing them generating 2 to 4x more ARPU and profit per user versus of payments only. We see the same story when we look at the enterprise side of the business, this is a business where we provide with a large online player, a omnichannel there, providing you with a full suite of payment solutions including, whether it's just for QR or whether it's Visa, Mastercard or any other fund source, including domestic debit.\nAs I mentioned, our share in a number of transactions today in this business is over 50% across Visa, Mastercard, QRPH, that's a market. And with the addition of Maya Bank, we've now been able to integrate the ability for merchants, especially the SME, the MSMEs to be able to use Maya Bank deposit to put their settlement account. And we have now started testing and piloting better products to both macro and to small SMEs. So in the same portal, where they do all their transactions for payments, they are now able to draw down on credit, on working capital products, which we are able to provide on the back of seeing their payment transactions and business flows. So this is another area where we have piloted a number of products and are now scaling those and rolling those out through the course of the rest of 2023.\nAnd if you go to the next slide. To give you some color around the numbers, the number of depositors that we have in Maya Bank grew to 2.6 million. In fact, as of now, the number is pretty much close to 3 million depositors. And that's us having a deposit balance of PHP 24 billion. We have been, as I mentioned, we started with dispersing consumer loans, adding on newer product consumers and [indiscernible] on the micro and SME products. We have disclosed over PHP 16 billion of loans in the last month, and as a result of this expansion and the Maya, both the business on the enterprise side and on the consumer side, becoming key drivers. We've seen [indiscernible] EBITDA across the business have become profitable in the third quarter of 2023. And as Danny mentioned, thanks for that.\nNot only have we been able to grow it more than double our net income year-on-year, but we've been able to bring down our cash burn by nearly 40% versus last year, and with the expansion that we are seeing in the business with the continued growth in the net income as we launch new product and scale new products, we are looking at making the business cash flow positive towards the end of 2024.\nWith that, I'm going to hand us back to Al.\n\nAlfredo S. Panlilio\n\nEVP & Chief Revenue Officer, PLDT Inc.\n\nThank you. Thank you, S.B. I just wanted to give the outlook guidance for 2023. Service revenue growth, low single-digit growth for the group. EBITDA will also be low single digit growth. Telco core income will be at least PHP 24 billion. CapEx [indiscernible] for this year. And we will try to, we will continue, obviously, in dividends -- sorry, in this year. And then for dividend, we will obviously try to maintain a 60% dividend [indiscernible], MVP, if you might want to add a few things?\n\nManuel Pangilinan\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive, First Pacific Company Limited\n\nNo, I'm good, Al. Thank you. Thank you."

    "content": "Q1 2023 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2023 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nTELOSLOMAY 4, 3:00 AM\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to this Q1 presentation. Half a year has passed since we presented a new strategic direction for Telenor at our Capital Markets Day and I'm pleased to see that we have been able to demonstrate a solid strategic execution and a good financial development over the last quarters. We are confirming the ambition of top line growth in the Nordics with another quarter showing underlying growth of 5% in mobile service revenues. We have completed the 2 largest telecom mergers in Southeast Asia allowing for stronger market positions and enabling significant synergies. We have realized values in infrastructure by selling parts of our passive fiber infrastructure in Norway and we also see good organic performance and solid growth in our Infrastructure business unit. We see continued solid performance in Telenor Amp, our adjacent businesses, and this support the values we have indicated for this portfolio.\nAnd finally, we are moving forward with our modernization programs. Having closed the copper network late last year, we still see some year-on year headwind in our numbers, but we now see also growth turning positive for our fixed business in Norway. We are making good progress with the transformation of our operation in Norway and we have initiated several structural programs in other areas also in our Nordic operation. Then going to Thailand. It was great after actually many years' work to finally complete the amalgamation of dtac and True in the first quarter. This creates a clear fully fledged market leader in the large telco market in Thailand. And alongside with the merger we did in Malaysia, this is the 2 largest telecom transactions ever in Southeast Asia. I visited the new company in Thailand named True Corporation in March and it was very satisfying to meet the team, to see the new organization.\nThey are already up running with a positive attitude to realize the substantial synergies we have talked about and also to do that together with our partner. This has truly been a merger of equals where we are taking the best from dtac and from True into forming a new company. And besides revenue synergies from cross-selling and upselling, the True management also works on a broad set of opportunities to realize operational efficiencies. We expect to see good results from this work in the years to come. As one example of that, the new True Corporation issued a comprehensive network RFQ on the 2nd of March, 1 day after their establishment of the new company. This is expected to bring significant synergy benefits by way of consolidating the 2 networks. Then we move back to the Nordics. The 4 Nordic markets stands out as an attractive region with advanced digital demands from our customers and an ability to pay for the value we provide.\nAs I mentioned, we maintained mobile top line growth of around 5% in the Nordic regions also in this first quarter as we have also done in the previous 2 quarters excluding a revenue reversal in Denmark relating to 2018 and '19 accounts. Across the Nordic business units, value-added services continued to grow with around 15% in this quarter. This was driving around 40% of the overall 5% mobile service revenue growth. The remaining 60% of the growth is coming from upselling and price adjustments. As we said at our Capital Markets Day, I'm convinced that the common and the modern Nordic organization with products in demand and smart pricing in both the B2C and the B2B segment will continue to drive profitable growth over the quarters and years to come. However, growth is only 1 part of the ambition. We also need to improve profitability. We also need to modernize to continue to improve profitability.\nWe have carried out significant modernization programs the last years in Telenor and there is more to come. We took the decision to abandon the copper network back in 2018 and this has been one of the biggest projects we have been running in Telenor over the last few years. The upside is that we now can move forward with the legacy free future-proof network actually as the first incumbent in Europe. We have talked about the headwinds from copper over the last years and you see that in this slide and in 2022 also the headwinds we got from energy costs. These negative effects are now gradually subsiding and we see the EBITDA figures in our Norwegian business improving fast on both a reported and on an underlying basis. I believe this is a demonstration of the value of being early with the modernization of our company and the reason that we now can report an underlying EBITA growth of 8.2% in Telenor Norway in this quarter.\nThe headwind from the copper decommissioning will continue to ease. This quarter it was around NOK150 million, down from more than NOK200 million in the last quarter. In Q2 we expect this to further decline down to NOK90 million and then further be reduced in the second half of the year. The modernization is also supporting our ESG ambition and we are well underway to execute on the ambition we presented at our Capital Markets Day last year. In a nutshell, Telenor works towards advancing the digital world and making it green, safe and for all. In the area on environment, we continue to deliver on our ambitious targets. In Telenor, we now commit to the net 0 standard set by the Science Based Target initiative. This also includes our Asian operations. We are working with our suppliers to have them setting science based targets and have already reached 44% of the supplier spend.\nIn social, our focus is to drive social and digital inclusion. In Q1 we continued to leverage on partnerships to build skills and ensure a safe online experience for all. And 200,000 people were trained in future skills and on life safety across the Nordics, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In our recruitment processes, we have a strong focus on gender diversity and inclusion. All our senior leaders now across both the group functions, but also the business units, we now have 34% women leaders. Telenor was also the only private sector company to be part of the official Norwegian delegation to the UN's commission on status of women that took place in March in New York. In governance, we continue to uphold our high standard of a responsible and well governed business across our operations. Over the past quarters, a special attention has obviously been given to establish a robust governance framework and setup in the 2 new minority positions we have in Thailand and Malaysia.\nSumming up, I'm glad to report that we are ahead of our plans and can already now tick of what we set out to do the first year after our Capital Markets Day. Our 4 business areas are up for a good start. We have closed the 2 mergers in Malaysia and Thailand. We have closed the partial sale of the fiber asset in Norway. We have completed the decommissioning of the copper network. And we are well underway on the modernization agenda in Norway as we have already in this quarter reorganized and reduced 200 FTEs in Norway. We will further take out another 200 consultants off roles in the Norwegian operation during the year. We are now focusing on the next phase of the strategy to increase the cash flow based on the new setup. In the Nordics, we are aiming for continued top line growth in the coming years and combined with improved cost efficiencies, this is expected to drive mid single-digit EBITDA growth in the medium term as we talked about at the Capital Markets Day.\nWe have already started the transformation programs in Norway and next out is Finland with a focus on improved efficiency. We also plan for a reduction of CapEx in the Nordics. We're running peak on CapEx now, and Tone will talk more about that, which will also materially improve cash flow generation in the Nordic region in the coming years. Furthermore, with the 2 mergers in Asia now being completed, we are set to extract material synergies and improve upstream dividend to Telenor. Finally, we will continue to work to show the values on our Infrastructure and adjacent businesses in Telenor Amp. In the Amp portfolio, we have developed a develop or divest approach and our ambition is to develop leading Nordic positions in selected high growth segments like IoT and security and also selected investments within prioritized areas.\nThat concludes my presentation and I will then give the floor to Tone.\n\nTone Hegland Bachke\n\nExecutive VP, Group CFO & Head of Group Treasury, Telenor ASA\n\nThank you, Sigve, and good morning, everyone. We have established a clear strategic path for Telenor for the coming years and from this quarter, we are changing the reporting format to align the financial reporting with our strategy. Our new structure focuses on the 4 business areas and I'm glad to say that we can start off by reporting a solid set of numbers in all 4 areas this quarter. The growth in service revenue and EBITDA supports our full year guidance for Telenor Nordic and we also see strong numbers both in Infrastructure and in Telenor Amp. In the Nordics, we delivered another solid quarter with good underlying revenue momentum. The reported figures were, however, negatively affected by a reversal of NOK68 million in revenue and EBITDA in Denmark. This relates to 2018 and 2019 accounts. As this relates to this incident several years ago, I will present the development in the Nordics versus last year without this reversal.\nAs Sigve mentioned, we saw continued solid mobile service revenue growth at 5% and fixed revenue also turned positive in Q1 as the headwind from the copper decommissioning is subsiding. The mobile network modernization and 5G rollout continue at a high pace in all the Nordic business units. This is reflected in a high CapEx level of 19% of sales based on the front-loaded CapEx profile this year and we maintain a CapEx to sales guiding for Nordic of around 17%. The consolidated numbers for Asia now includes GP, TP and the Asian hub cost. Organic revenues in the 2 consolidated entities in Bangladesh and Pakistan grew by 2%. EBITDA declined by 1% as the tough macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan continued to put pressure on the financial performance. As earlier communicated, we are very pleased to have completed the amalgamation in Thailand in the first quarter. In reporting terms, this means that our Thai operation has been deconsolidated this quarter.\nGoing forward, there will be a lag of 1 quarter in the financial reporting for the 2 associated companies in Asia and therefore we are not going to see the full contribution from our operations in Malaysia and Thailand fully incorporated in the net results from associated companies until the third quarter this year. This quarter we include 2 months of results from dtac under the discontinued operation whereas our share of the results in the new True Corporation for the month of March will be recognized as an associated company in the second quarter reporting. This is similar for CelcomDigi where only our share of the net results for the month of December is recognized as an associated company this quarter. As we stated at the CMD, we have a cash flow focus in how we run our Asian operations and in respect of this, I'm pleased to report that Telenor already have received the first dividend from CelcomDigi in Q1. This amounted to NOK271 million.\nWithin the Infrastructure segment, we see solid performance this quarter. The organic revenue growth of 13% is driven by price increases for power and lease as well as higher lease volumes. EBITDA after lease improved significantly and showed a margin improvement from 46% to 49%. Going forward, we continue our focus on operational and strategic development of our infrastructure assets. Amp started the year with a strong performance in all consolidated assets partly helped by positive timing and currency effect. However, organic revenue growth was 25%. Connexion reported strong SIM shipments this period while the revenue growth in Linx was driven by growth in messaging revenue. Telenor Maritime also saw significant improvements. The Cruise segment has over the past years been severely affected by the effects of the pandemic, but now we see Telenor Maritime's revenue trending above prepandemic levels.\nMoving to service revenue. I'm pleased to see that we have service revenue growth across all business areas this quarter. We see service revenue growth in all the Nordic BUs contributing to the solid trend from last year and with an overall growth of 3.3%. Norway turned positive with 4% growth in mobile service revenue and 8% growth in fiber and fixed wireless access more than offsetting the copper headwind. As we showed you last quarter, the headwind from copper will continue to decline in the coming quarters and making for cleaner year-over-year comparables. Sweden showed revenue growth of 6% reflecting both price changes in the mobile portfolio and solid subscriber growth compared to last year. The positive momentum continued also in Denmark with 4% service revenue growth. And in Finland, they continued the strong customer growth and price adjustment, which generated 6% growth in service revenues this quarter.\nIn Asia, Grameenphone in Bangladesh delivered a 3% growth in the quarter. In Pakistan, we see continued headwind from the tough macroeconomic situation resulting in a service revenue decline of 2%. And we see the strong performance in Amp contributing close to 1% of the total revenue leading to a 3.3% overall growth for the group. For the record, the revenue in Infrastructure is not defined as service revenue. Turning to OpEx. We report a 4% or NOK263 million OpEx increase in Q1 compared to the same period last year. NOK100 million of this increase reflects higher energy cost in Asia and adjusted for this, the increase was around 2.5%. Another NOK80 million were driven by increased salaries and personnel cost, around 3% increase in this category and NOK70 million by increased sales and marketing spend particularly in the Nordics. The OpEx increase overall was roughly split 50:50 between the Nordics and Asia.\nAnd in the Nordics, the increase was primarily driven by sales and marketing spend while in Asia, as I said, the majority comes from the higher energy cost. Energy cost has been a hot topic the last year and as you can see, the cost are still at a high level compared to historical numbers. However, the energy cost in the Nordic have moderated somewhat and is down 12% compared to Q4. Throughout our businesses, energy cost and consumption continued to be high on the agenda. From Q1 '22 to Q1 '23, we see that the consumption remained stable in Norway where higher consumption from the 5G rollout was offset by the effects from switching off power for copper legacy equipment as well as the energy saving initiatives we implemented in Norway. The total electricity consumption in the fixed segment is now significantly lower than previous year.\nThis is mainly as a result of the decommissioning of the copper business, which has enabled a 27% decline in energy consumption in the fixed line business compared to Q1 last year. In the outlook we provide for 2023, as you recall, we have a neutral assumption for energy cost in the Nordic for the year overall and as such if prices were to come down below last year's level, we could have an upside potential. Summing up the consolidated results at the EBITDA level, we see a 2% increase compared to last year. Nordic EBITDA growth ended at 1% as we are still impacted by high energy prices and year-over-year effects from copper decommissioning as well as sales and commission and some increased personnel cost. In Norway, we have a stable reported EBITDA, but with a 8% growth when excluding copper effects and energy as Sigve showed you. In Sweden and Denmark, we continue to see EBITDA growth driven by solid top line momentum while EBITDA in Finland was somewhat softer.\nAnd as Sigve mentioned, we are also underway with the modernization project to improve efficiency also in our Finnish operation. In Asia, EBITDA decreased by 1% as growth in Bangladesh was more than offset by the tough headwinds related to the macroeconomic situation in Pakistan. The solid growth in Infrastructure contributed 1% to EBITDA with the growth driven both by external revenue and pass-through of energy cost. The Amp portfolio also continues to perform very well and with 27% growth in EBITDA, it also contribute close to 1% to the overall group EBITDA growth. Net income to equity holders of Telenor ended at NOK18 billion for Q1. The EBITDA of NOK8 billion and the depreciation and amortization of NOK4 billion was in line with expectation and comparable to last year. This year a material weakening of the Norwegian kroner results in a negative currency impact related to debt where hedge accounting does not apply which is, as you might recall, primarily in US dollars.\nConsequently, this quarter we report a NOK3.1 billion currency loss. This contributes to a slightly negative net income for the quarter of minus NOK0.6 billion before including the material gain of NOK18.5 billion following the deconsolidation of dtac. As a result, the net income to equity holders this quarter ended at NOK18 billion. Please note that the gain related to the part sale of the Fiber business was taken directly towards the equity and hence did not have a P&L effect. However, the transaction in Asia have demonstrated the values in our portfolio. Overall equity increased by NOK26 billion in the first quarter and this was driven by the dtac transaction fiber and also FX. The last 12 months the equity in Telenor has strengthened by around NOK60 billion and the book equity is up from 17% in Q1 last year to 39% this quarter.\nFrom an overall perspective this quarter, there are significant impacts from currency both with positive effects such as on valuation and asset values and equities as I said and also the negative impacts which relates to liability and currency losses on debt. CapEx in the quarter came in at NOK3.5 billion or 18% of sales, which reflects the still high investment level in 5G in the Nordics. Free cash flow in the quarter came in at NOK6 billion. This reflects both the proceeds from the fiber sale in Norway, but also the deconsolidation of cash in dtac and the purchase of shares in True Corp to obtain the equal ownership of 30.3%. Furthermore, we made a payment of warranties in India of NOK1.5 billion. Free cash flow excluding M&A was NOK400 million. This mainly reflects our high CapEx payments in the Nordic. In addition, there was a negative NOK500 million effect from a spectrum payment in dtac before it was deconsolidated.\nThe leverage ratio stood at 2.1 at the end of the period, which is in the middle of the indicated leverage range. The weakening of the NOK had a negative impact of around 0.1. Rounding off, we reiterate our outlook statement for 2023 and the mid term. Looking at the Nordics, on the reported numbers, we deliver 2% revenue growth and a flat EBITDA. Excluding the oneoff historic reversal in Denmark, we deliver 3% growth and 1% EBITDA growth in the Nordics. As you know, we have guided for low-to-mid single-digit growth for both revenue and EBITDA in the Nordics this year and in the medium term, we expect improving EBITDA margin as we continue modernizing and no longer face headwind from the copper decommissioning. CapEx to sale was high at 19% in the Nordics in Q1. But as we said, we consider the CapEx to be front-loaded this year and we stick with our guidance of CapEx to sales for the full year at around 17%. Looking further ahead, we also confirm our plan to reduce CapEx in the Nordics by NOK2 billion from 2022 to 2025.\nSigve, with that, we are ready for questions.\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO\n\nGood. So do we have the moderator?"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVP of IR, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website te.com.\nI also want to remind you that our Q4 results include an extra week, and we will be discussing some of our results on both the 14-week and 13-week basis during the call. Please see the appendix in the slide presentation for the impact of the extra week in our results as well as the accompanying reconciliations.\nFinally, during the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question, and you may rejoin the queue if you have a second question.\nNow let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin\n\nCEO & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Sujal, and we appreciate everyone joining us today. As I typically like to do at the beginning of these calls, before we get into the slides, I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance, along with some of the developments that we're seeing since our call just 90 days ago. While there are a number of external data points showing crosscurrents from global economic uncertainty, we continue to perform well, and you'll see this both in our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results.\nOur performance came in ahead of our guidance and continues to demonstrate the benefits for how we strategically positioned our portfolio around secular growth trends as we continue to outperform our markets. We also are demonstrating operational performance in serving our customers and delivering strong financial results despite the broader macro challenges.\nOur backlog remains near all-time high levels and our overall order levels imply solid demand across the majority of the markets we serve. Within this backdrop, we have some markets that are growing, some that are still in recovery mode back to pre-pandemic levels and others that are showing signs of moderation.\nAt the same time, we're being negatively impacted by a stronger dollar, which will continue to be a significant headwind into 2023. I also want to highlight that our teams continue to proactively implement price increases to keep up with ongoing inflationary pressures. I am confident in our ability to execute in the short term as we navigate these challenges, and I am excited about the long-term opportunities as we go forward. And Heath and I will go into more details on these moving pieces as we discuss our performance and outlook on the call.\nTo summarize our financial performance, we delivered strong results again in the fourth quarter with double-digit organic growth and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. For the full year, our adjusted sales and adjusted EPS were records with sales up 12% organically and adjusted earnings per share up 13% versus the prior year despite headwinds from foreign currency exchange and inflationary pressures.\nWith this quick backdrop, let me give you some details on what we're experiencing. First, on the orders front. We're seeing some puts and takes across the different end markets we serve, and this is reflected in our orders in our backlog. With the higher backlog levels that we have and the stability we're starting to see in our supply chain for the first time since COVID, it is reasonable to see our book-to-bill below 1 in the quarter.\nOur backlog remains strong at $6 billion, which is almost 2x higher than pre-COVID levels. If you click down on orders by segment, Transportation and Industrial are continuing to show positive order trends. In Transportation, OEM auto production is still constrained by supply chain limitations and end demand remains above current levels of production. So we continue to have a favorable outlook for this market long term on both production as well as the content growth.\nIn the Industrial segment, we continue to expect growth in comm air and medical markets as reflected in our orders, along with the benefits from wind and solar applications in our energy business. Renewables now represent 20% of our energy sales and the comm air market is still recovering to pre-COVID levels and both of these will be growth areas within the industrial segment in 2023.\nIn our Communications segment, we are seeing orders decline in the appliance market. Based upon recent developments, we have seen our orders to cloud customers moderate reflecting lower capital spending, along with inventory adjustments in the data center supply chain. We also continue to experience inflationary pressures, and this is particularly true for resins that we use for molding as well as higher energy costs that impact our manufacturing operations globally. We are continuing to implement additional price increases to offset these inflationary costs and expect to have a positive contribution to margin later in '23 from the price cost dynamic.\nAnd the last thing I want to highlight before we turn to the slides, and I think we consistently demonstrated, we will take actions to ensure our cost structure is in line with what we're seeing in the market environment, and Heath will provide additional details on this in his section.\nSo now let's get into the slides, and I'd ask you to turn to Slide 3, and I'll cover some additional highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year, as well as get into our first quarter outlook. As Sujal mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter included an extra week. Our fourth quarter sales were $4.4 billion, which were up 14% on a reported basis. Our adjusted operating margins were 17.4%, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.88, and this was up 11% year-over-year.\nIf you include the extra week to get to a better apples-to-apples comparison, our fourth quarter sales were slightly over $4 billion and this was up 12% organically year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share were $1.75. A key thing to highlight in the fourth quarter is that we delivered record free cash flow of $745 million in the quarter, which demonstrates our strong cash generation model, and we returned over $500 million to shareholders.\nI do want to highlight, and we've discussed it with you previously, earlier in the year, we did increase inventory levels to deal with supply chain volatility and ensure we can meet the needs of our customers. As we have begun to see our supply chain improving, we decided to get our inventory more in line and reduced our inventory by approximately $350 million in the quarter and you'll see our days on hand were actually down year-on-year in the fourth quarter.\nWe do believe this was prudent balance sheet management in the current environment, and this action improved our free cash flow in the quarter but does pressure our margin in the short term.\nSo now let me touch upon a few additional highlights for our full year results. Our fiscal 2022 results were a record at $16.3 billion, and this is up 9% year-over-year on a reported basis despite currency exchange headwinds of approximately $760 million. Sales were up 12% organically with Industrial and Communications up double digits and Transportation up high single digits, demonstrating the strategic positioning of our portfolio.\nAdjusted earnings per share was a record at $7.33, which was up 13% year-over-year and adjusted operating margins were 18.2%, with expansion in the Industrial and Communications segments versus the prior year.\nFor the full year, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders between share buybacks and dividends as our focus was on organic investment in the business as well as return of capital to our owners.\nNow with that as a wrap-up of the financials for 2022, let me touch upon our first quarter guidance. And I want to frame this out by incorporating some of the moving pieces I already highlighted for you. I do want to make sure we have the right baseline together for guidance. So when you look at this, the year-over-year comparison would be against $3.8 billion of sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22, and the sequential comparison would be against the 13-week sales in quarter 4 of $4 billion.\nSo if we look at it going back to quarter 1 of 2022 -- I mean, sorry, '23, we do expect sales of approximately $3.75 billion. And the sales in the first quarter of '23 will be up 9% organically and down slightly on a reported basis year-over-year despite approximately $400 million of FX headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.50, which includes year-over-year headwinds of approximately $0.25 from currency exchange and a higher tax rate of 21%, which will be up from a year ago.\nWhen you look at our guidance sequentially versus the 13-week $4 billion, we are declining by $300 million in sales and $0.25 in EPS. Roughly half of our top line sequential decline is from foreign currency, with the remaining balance split between typical seasonality and the decline in the communications volume due to end market moderation. The EPS decline is driven by foreign exchange and volume declines I just mentioned, as well as a temporary impact from the proactive inventory reductions we drove in the fourth quarter.\nWhile we have some near-term pressures that are nonstructural, we have been making progress on what we can control with our teams driving price increases this past year to partially offset the increasing inflationary pressures. As we've mentioned in the past, in Transportation, there is a lag between inflation and our ability to recover through price. We have implemented additional price increases, which would get Transportation margins back up into the high teens sometime in the second half of '23.\nWhile we are working through the crosscurrents we're experiencing, one thing that has not changed is the benefit we continue to see from the secular trends in our markets and the outperformance we're generating from content growth. We are benefiting from our position in electric vehicles, smart factory applications including automation, renewable energy and high-speed cloud and artificial intelligence applications. We remain committed to our business model and long-term value creations for growth, margin expansion, as well as driving our strong cash generation model.\nSo with that, wrapping up the highlight slide, let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll share some more details on orders. For the fourth quarter, our orders were $4.3 billion, and this reflects resiliency in both Transportation and Industrial, and also demonstrates moderation in our Communications segment. Our backlog of $6 billion is up 11% year-over-year, and I want to emphasize that we're seeing very little impact from pushouts or cancellations from our customers.\nIn transportation, we had a book-to-bill of 1.03, along with a strong backlog position. This reflects favorable demand patterns and demand for auto continues to be higher than what OEMs can currently produce, providing a favorable backdrop for production increases as our customer supply chain bottlenecks begin to resolve and dealer inventories get back to historical levels. Our content growth remains strong with content per vehicle expanding in fiscal '22 to over $80 per vehicle from the $60 range pre-COVID. We do expect further content expansion due to our global leadership position and increased adoption of electric vehicles globally.\nIn our Industrial segment, we had a book-to-bill of 1.01. Year-over-year order growth was driven by both AD&M and our medical businesses as these businesses continue to recover from pre-pandemic levels. And in our Communications segment, orders declined year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting expected decline in appliances and moderation in Data & Devices as the data center supply chain adjust inventory levels for its cloud customers. Despite this market cyclicality, we expect to continue to outgrow the market in the Data & Devices business due to share gains and benefits from high speed and AI implementations in the data center and cloud.\nNow let me provide a little color on what we're seeing in orders geographically. On a 13-week organic basis by region, we saw year-over-year growth of 6% in China and Europe, while North America was essentially flat. On a sequential basis, we saw orders grow 18% in China with single-digit declines in Europe as well as in North America.\nSo with that as a backdrop of orders and backlog, let me turn it over to Heath, and he'll get into the segment highlights as well as some information on the financials.\n\nHeath A. Mitts\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now briefly discuss year-over-year segment results in the quarter on Slides 5 through 7. You can see the details on the slides, and I will talk about organic sales performance on a 13-week basis. Slide 5. Transportation sales were up 13% organically year-over-year. Our Auto business grew 16% organically with growth across all regions. We continue to increase our content per vehicle through our global leadership in EV. Electric vehicles now account for nearly 20% of auto production with further increases in production expected in '23.\nTo provide context, EV and HEV production has grown 3x from 2019 with 14 million units produced in 2022. And importantly, for 2023, we expect our market outperformance to be well above our stated 4% to 6% range in automotive. In Commercial Transportation, we saw 13% organic growth driven by North America and Europe with significant market outperformance in all regions, driven by content growth and share gains this year.\nIn Sensors, we declined 3% organically with our focused growth areas offset by continued portfolio optimization activities. At the Transportation segment level, adjusted operating margins were 16.6% and the margins reflect the short-term impact from our planned inventory reduction along with the timing of price actions to offset inflationary pressures, which Terrence mentioned earlier.\nMoving to the next slide, the Industrial segment. Sales increased 16% organically year-over-year. Industrial Equipment was up 20% organically with double-digit growth in all regions and continued benefits from factory automation applications. Aerospace and defense was also up 20% organically, with growth driven primarily by ongoing market improvement in comm air. In energy, we saw 16% organic growth driven by increased penetration in renewable applications.\nOur medical sales were up 3% organically with increases in interventional procedures as the medical device market continues to work through supply chain challenges. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded year-over-year to 16.5%, driven by higher volume, price actions and implementation of previous cost actions.\nThe next slide, Communications. We had 3% organic growth year-over-year In Data & Devices, we saw continued market outperformance driven by content growth in high-speed cloud and share gains in artificial intelligence applications. Our appliance business declined 6% organic, reflecting the expected moderation in this end market that will continue into fiscal '23. Communications adjusted operating margins were 21.7%, reflecting the lower sales in the appliance business.\nIf you turn to Slide 8, where I'll provide more details on the Q4 financials. As mentioned earlier, Q4 includes an extra week and we have provided tables in the appendix that bridge sales, margins and EPS for that extra week. Sales of $4.4 billion were up 14% on a reported basis year-over-year and currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $348 million versus the prior year.\nAdjusted operating income was $757 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 17.4%. We are being impacted in the near term by nonstructural pressures of foreign exchange, inflation and the previously mentioned inventory reduction. While we can't influence currency exchange rates, we are continuing to be proactive on recovering inflationary pressures through price increases. Additional upcoming price increases will go into effect in Transportation, helping to lift segment margins back to the high teens in the second half of fiscal '23.\nAnd while our Q4 inventory reduction has a near-term impact on margins, we do expect margin expansion as we move through this year with the back half closer to run rate company margins. And as you know, we were in the 18% range for most of fiscal '22.\nGAAP operating income was $660 million and included $82 million of restructuring and other charges and $15 million of acquisition-related charges. For the full year, restructuring charges were approximately $150 million, which were in line with expectations. We did ramp up our restructuring charges in Q4 to proactively react to the market environment. While I expect restructuring charges in fiscal '23 to be roughly consistent with fiscal '22, the charges will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, and we will continue to further evaluate cost actions as we move forward.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.88, and GAAP EPS was $2.21 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.57 related to discrete tax benefits during the quarter. Additionally, we had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.25. The adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 19% in both Q4 and fiscal '22 and for Q1 in fiscal '23, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be roughly 21%. Importantly, we continue to expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our stated ETR for the full year.\nTurning to year-over-year comparisons on Slide 9. Fiscal '22 sales of $16.3 billion were a record and up 9% on a reported basis and 12% organically year-over-year. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately $760 million versus the prior year due to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, we expect currency exchange rate headwinds to be approximately $1 billion for fiscal '23, with roughly 70% of this headwind to be felt in the first half of the fiscal year. This equates to approximately 600 basis points of headwinds to reported growth in fiscal '23.\nAdjusted EPS expanded 13% year-over-year to $7.33 and adjusted operating margins were 18.2%, with year-over-year expansion in our Industrial and Communications segments.\nTurning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, with over $2 billion returned to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We continue to remain disciplined in our use of capital and our long-term strategy remains consistent, which is to return approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders and use 1/3 for acquisitions.\nNear term, we have been aggressive in buying back our stock and taking advantage of investing in our own organic value creation opportunities. And before we get into questions, let me wrap up. We delivered strong performance this past year. Our teams have continued to execute well in this volatile environment to effectively serve our customers. And while we have some near-term headwinds, I am excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us this fiscal year. Our positioning of the portfolio will drive content outperformance. We also have a trajectory for further margin expansion and EPS growth through actions we can control, including price increases to fully offset inflation, cost reduction initiatives and a strong balance sheet that can support investments for growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders.\nSo there's a lot to be excited about there. Now let's open it up for questions.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVP of IR, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nAngela, can you please give the directions for the Q&A session."

Curtin\n\nCEO & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Sujal, and I also want to thank everyone for joining us today to cover our results for the third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nAs I normally do, and before Heath and I get into the details on the slide, I want to take a moment to discuss our performance within the backdrop of the current environment. We delivered strong performance again in the third quarter with record sales, and this represents 11% organic growth year-over-year. We had growth in each of our 3 segments and organic growth across all 9 of our business units.\nAdjusted operating margins were in the mid-18% range, and this is a level similar to where we've been running through the year despite incremental headwinds that we've been experiencing, and we also delivered record adjusted earnings per share that was above our guidance.\nI feel our performance is a result of how we strategically positioned our portfolio around secular growth trends as well as the execution of our teams, both from a manufacturing perspective and in our ability to effectively manage pricing in this inflationary environment. I'm also proud of our team as they continue to overcome broader macro challenges to effectively serve our customers and deliver the strong financial results we're going to talk about today.\nNow let me provide some color on the supply environment, key end demand trends and the development since our call 90 days ago. When we provided our guidance last quarter, we told you about an anticipated impact from the sales -- on our sales to the COVID lockdown in China. And even though these lockdowns extended further into the third quarter than our original expectations, our teams were able to recover, and the sales impact of the quarter was negligible.\nWhen you think about the global supply chain challenges and specifically around material availability, I would tell you they're about the same as they were 90 days ago and inflationary pressures continue to linger. One element that I want to highlight that has changed since the last time we spoke is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This strengthening has significantly increased the headwind we're facing from foreign currency exchange rates both year-over-year and sequentially, and Heath will talk about that a little bit more later.\nTurning to the markets. Customer demand remains strong as evidenced by our order levels and our strong backlog position. And just to highlight, our backlog has grown over 20% versus the prior year. And we are seeing some consumer-facing markets like appliance moderate, but we continue to see broad strength across our industrial segment, and we still have a number of markets that we serve that are not yet back to pre-COVID levels. And this includes automotive, commercial air as well as medical devices. And we expect growth in these businesses as supply constraints are alleviated and those markets continue to recover.\nThe other thing that I want to highlight we've consistently talked about, and it has not changed, is the benefit we continue to see from the secular trends in our markets and the outperformance that we're generating from content growth and share gains. We are benefiting from our position as an industrial technology leader with growth from electric vehicles, smart factory applications, including automation, renewable energy and high-speed cloud and artificial intelligence applications.\nThe other thing that I want to highlight that we -- as we continue to navigate through this noisy macro environment, is that we remain committed to our business model and long-term value creation by driving further growth, margin expansion and strong cash generation.\nSo with that as a backdrop, let me get into the slides and discuss additional highlights that are on Slide 3. Our quarter 3 sales were a record at $4.1 billion, and this was up 7% on a reported basis and up 11% organically. As I mentioned, we saw growth across each of our segments and organic growth across all of our businesses, once again demonstrating the strength and positioning of the portfolio. We generated double-digit organic growth in the industrial and communications segments and 8% organic growth in transportation despite an auto production environment that was essentially flat year-over-year. Our orders were $4.2 billion in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.02, and this shows that the demand environment continues to be strong, and I'll get into more details about order trends by segment when I get to the next slide.\nFrom an earnings perspective, our adjusted earnings per share was a record at $1.86, and that's up 4% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin of 18.6%. From a cash flow generation, our year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $1 billion with approximately $1.6 billion returned to shareholders this year. And I will tell you we've been aggressive with share buybacks as we're taking advantage of the recent market price dislocations with our stock.\nAs we look forward, we are expecting quarter 4 sales to be approximately $4.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share to be around $1.85. Our guidance reflects the benefits of an extra week that we have in the fourth quarter but also factors in the impact of an increased headwind from currency exchange rates. And if you look at the slide, we've provided the details of each of these items and how they impact our fourth quarter.\nBefore I get into orders, one thing I do want to do is move away from the financials for a moment and highlight that I'm pleased that we issued our 12th corporate responsibility report last quarter, which reinforces our One Connected World strategy. When you look at the report, it has many highlights, but one of the keys that I think is important was that we were successful in driving a 30% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions in a single year in fiscal 2021, and this was a very large step towards our goal of achieving a 40%-plus absolute reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. So with those being the highlights on Slide 3, let me turn to Slide 4, and I'll discuss order trends as well as what we're seeing in our markets.\nFor the third quarter, our orders were $4.2 billion as we expected, and this reflects the continued strong demand environment from our customers as well as we continue to see the impacts of ongoing supply chain volatility in the markets. Our backlog is up over 20% and increased double digits in each of our segments versus the prior year. It is also important to note that currency exchange headwinds are not only impacting our sales but also, when you look on the year-on-year compares, negatively impacts the valuable orders in the third quarter. And this impact when you look at the year-on-year compare, our orders would be $230 million higher this quarter if it wasn't for the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nIn transportation, we have a book-to-bill of 1 in the third quarter, which is in line with where the segment has run historically, and keep in mind that we also have a strong backlog position. And demand for auto remains healthy and is significantly higher than what OEMs can currently produce, providing a potential setup for future auto production increases as supply chain bottlenecks begin to resolve and dealer inventories get back to more normal levels.\nIn our Industrial segment, we saw another quarter of strong orders with a book-to-bill of 1.16 and growth across all businesses year-over-year. We continue to see a favorable backdrop in capital expenditures for factory automation, manufacturing capacity and renewable energy, and these trends benefit both our industrial equipment and our energy businesses. The other thing about our Industrial segment orders are we're continuing to see improving order trends in the commercial aerospace as well as medical markets where we expect growth as those markets continue to recover.\nIn our Communications segment, orders reflect a double-digit increase in our backlog versus the prior year, along with expected moderation in the appliance market that we've been talking about all year. And one thing when you look at the communications order trends, it is important to note that our backlog in our Communications segment is approximately $1 billion.\nSo with that as a backdrop on orders, let me get into the year-over-year segment results that you can see on Slide 5 through 7, and each one of those slides have the details for each segment. So starting with transportation. Our sales were up 8% organically year-over-year. Our auto business grew 9% organically versus auto production that was roughly flat versus the prior year. Global auto production was 18 million units, and this was slightly lower than our expectations due to lockdowns in China, and we do expect some sequential increase in auto production into the fourth quarter.\nThe trends around our content remain robust as we continue to benefit from increased electronification as well as higher production of electric vehicles, and we do expect electric vehicles to be up over 30% this year compared to a total auto production environment that is going to be flat. As we look forward, we do expect continued expansion in our content per vehicle, and you'll see that as we move from the first half to the second half of this year. In the commercial transportation market, we saw 10% organic growth driven by North America and Europe with significant market outperformance in all regions driven by strong content growth as well as share gains.\nIn our Sensors business, we grew 2% organically, and what was nice is that growth was driven by the focus we have on factory automation applications.\nWhen you look at earnings for the segment, adjusted operating margins were 17.3%, and this was impacted by the inflationary pressures. As you know, there is a time lag from when we incur higher inflation until price increases become effective with our auto customers.\nSo let's move to the Industrial segment. And in our Industrial segment, sales increased 13% organically year-over-year. Industrial Equipment was up 19% organically with double-digit growth in all regions and continued benefit from increased capital spending in factory automation.\nIn our Energy business, we saw 17% organic growth driven by increased penetration in renewable applications. And in our Aerospace, Defense and Marine business, this is the first time we've seen year-over-year growth since the market was impacted by COVID, and we now expect continued growth as we go forward. Our medical sales in the segment were up 1% organically with a modest increase in interventional procedures as well as medical device market is continuing to work through supply chain challenges.\nFrom a segment margin perspective, our adjusted operating margins expanded year-over-year by 100 basis points to 16.8% driven by higher volume and strong operational performance by our team. We have made significant progress on our margin progression over the past several years, and I'm pleased with how the team continues to drive towards its business model target of consistent high teens operating margin.\nSo let's turn to the Communications segment. And as you can just see looking at the slide, our team continues to execute while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets they serve. Sales growth was 16% organically year-over-year for the segment with growth in both businesses, as highlighted on the slide. In our Data and Device business, we saw market outperformance driven by content growth in high-speed cloud as well as share gains in artificial intelligence applications. And as we highlighted last quarter, these artificial intelligence applications do improve energy efficiency in the data center, and it's just another example of how we enable lower carbon emissions with our customers through our engineering. In our appliance business, it didn't perform ahead of our expectations despite the expected declines in the China market. We saw growth both in North America and Europe in our appliance business, and that is driven by continued share gains enabled by our global manufacturing strategy.\nFrom a margin perspective, the communications team continues to deliver outstanding performance. The adjusted operating margins were 26.2%, and this was up 270 basis points versus a strong quarter in the prior year, and our teams continued to deliver strong performance both on sales as well as proving margin resiliency.\nSo with that as a backdrop of our segment results, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials as well as our expectations going forward.\n\nHeath A. Mitts\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Terrence. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q3 financials.\nAdjusted operating income was $761 million with an adjusted operating margin of 18.6%. GAAP operating income was $719 million and included $30 million of restructuring and other charges and $12 million of acquisition-related charges. We continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million for the full year as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.86, and GAAP EPS was $1.83 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.06. And additionally, we had restructuring acquisition and other charges of approximately $0.09.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was approximately 19%. For the fourth quarter, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 20%, so we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 19% for the full year. Importantly, we continue to expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our adjusted ETR for the full year.\nNow turn to Slide 9. Sales of $4.1 billion, a company record, were up 17% reported and up 11% on an organic basis year-over-year. When you think about our organic growth, approximately 1/3 was driven by price increases, and the remaining 2/3 was driven by volume as a result of the strength of our portfolio. In the third quarter, currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $236 million and $0.07 versus the prior year. As Terrence mentioned, FX impacts have worsened significantly over the past 90 days. In Q4, we expect currency exchange rates to be a sequential headwind of approximately $70 million and a year-over-year headwind of approximately $275 million. For the full year, we now expect a negative impact from FX of roughly $700 million, which is significantly worse than our view 90 days ago.\nAdjusted EPS was a record at $1.86. Adjusted operating margins were 18.6%, and I am pleased with the performance of our team given the incremental inflationary and supply chain pressures we are seeing. We continue to pull pricing levers across the business to help partially offset these pressures. And as we talked about last quarter, while we are not able to offset these costs dollar for dollar, we continue to recover approximately 2/3 through price and the remaining through productivity initiatives. We continue taking pricing actions to offset these inflationary pressures.\nTurning to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations -- excuse me, from operating activities was $579 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $423 million. As we mentioned in past calls, the year-over-year trend in free cash flow does reflect strategic inventory builds. However, we expect to work down inventory this quarter with Q4 expected to be the highest quarter of free cash flow for the fiscal year. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we have returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders with approximately $1.1 billion returned through share buybacks. We will continue to remain disciplined in our use of capital. And near term, we have been aggressive in buying back our stock and taking advantage of investing in our own value creation opportunities.\nSo we've made significant progress towards our business model over the past few years, and our teams are continuing to execute well in a volatile environment. The strategic positioning of the portfolio has enabled us to deliver sales growth, margin resiliency and EPS expansion despite the challenges we are facing. We will continue to focus on what we can control to effectively serve our customers and drive strong financial performance, including strong cash generation.\nSo now let's open it up for questions, Sujal?\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVP of IR, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you. Can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?[id=\"-1\" name=\"Operator\" />\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS."

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVP of IR, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's second quarter 2022 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.\nDuring this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.\nThe press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. Due to the large number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question. We are willing to take follow-up questions but ask that you rejoin the queue if you have a second question. Now let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin\n\nCEO & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Sujal. And also, I appreciate every joining us today. to cover our second quarter results as well as our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal '22. Before Heath and I take you through the slides and details, I want to take a moment to discuss the current environment and frame our performance relative to some of the developments that we've been seeing.\nSince our last earnings call 3 months ago, we've seen some elements of the macro environment become more volatile. And specifically, we've seen the invasion of Ukraine as well as COVID lockdowns in certain parts of China. While we've seen volatility increase, we continue to see strong end demand trends across the markets that we serve. And I'm very pleased that despite the incremental pressures, our teams were able to deliver results in quarter 2 that were ahead of our expectations.\nOur continued strong performance is a result of how we strategically positioned our portfolio around secular growth trends. Also, the resilience of our global manufacturing strategy, where we have invested to produce in region, and the commitment of the hard work of our employees across the world. I'm very proud of our teams as they continue to overcome broader challenges to effectively serve our customers to both manage the present while also ensuring we're winning programs that will drive future growth for TE.\nI'd like to put our performance into perspective a little bit. We've made significant progress towards our business model over the past couple of years. We've been driving top line growth despite market headwinds, executing successfully on cost reduction and footprint consolidation plans, and driving margin and earnings per share growth despite the supply chain and inflationary pressures that we faced.\nAnd if you look at TE versus a pre-COVID time frame of fiscal 2019, our auto sales have increased nearly 20%, against auto production declines of approximately 10 million units or 15%, and this really illustrates our global strengths in the automotive space as well as the content gains we've been talking to you about. Our industrial equipment and data and device businesses have both grown approximately 50% over the same time frame, and this is significantly above the markets that we serve, showing the benefit of where we strategically position these businesses as well as the strong execution of our teams.\nI do think it's important to separate signal from noise as you look at TE from an investment perspective. While we are in a very noisy environment near term, the longer-term growth signals across our portfolio remain positive. These signals are secular in nature, giving us confidence that we will continue to perform in line with our business model through cycle as an industrial technology leader.\nWe have all 3 segments contributing to our performance. For example, in our Transportation segment, we are the established global leader for EV connectivity solutions. Over the past year, the value of our design win pipeline grew by over 50%, and we are designed into every major electric vehicle and hybrid platform with customers around the world.\nThis positioning has been driving and will continue to fuel our content growth and enable consistent above-market performance in our Transportation segment. If you turn to our Industrial segment, we are in the heart of the industrial automation trend and have grown our sales at double the rate of capital expenditures as the markets recovered from COVID.\nWe've been working with industry-leading customers to develop engineered solutions targeting higher-growth robotic and safety applications, and this is resulting in the robust growth pipeline that you're seeing. And in our Communications segment, we are expanding content in high-speed cloud applications and gaining share in artificial intelligence deployments as customers implement workload architectures to make data centers more efficient. And these are just a few of the secular trends that we have positioned the portfolio around, which will drive future growth, and we remain excited about the long-term growth and margin expansion opportunities we still have in front of us.\nSo now let me highlight a couple of few additional takeaways from today's call. Our second quarter results were a record in quarterly sales and adjusted earnings per share with strong results in each segment. On a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15%, along with adjusted operating margins of 18.4%. The Margins expanded in each segment year-over-year as our teams are effectively managing pricing and cost in an inflationary environment to drive the margin performance across our businesses. The other key highlight is that the demand environment continues to be strong, and we'll talk about it, and it's evidenced in our orders, which were $4.5 billion in the quarter.\nOur book-to-bill was well above 1 for each segment, and it reflects the continued strength across our markets. The other highlight about our organic performance is that in the second quarter, it shows to strengthen the positioning of the portfolio with our Industrial and Communications segment growing over 10% and 20%, respectively, and our Transportation segment growing 5% despite auto production declines in the quarter.\nWe continue to benefit from the ramp of new electric vehicle platforms, which will continue to drive content outperformance for our Transportation segment. And the last highlight is that we are expecting our quarter 3 sales to be around $3.9 billion, and this does reflect continued strong performance. We have a strong demand environment. But coupled with the broader volatility, I do want to stress our ability to produce will remain a key factor in our near-term sales performance.\nSo let me turn now, and I'll provide some additional color on some key end demand trends as well as talk about the supply environment. We are continuing to see broad strength in global capital expenditures that relate to factory automation, cloud and data center efficiency as well as renewable energy sources. End demand for autos remain healthy and is significantly higher than what the OEMs can produce, and this provides a set for future auto production increases as supply chain bottlenecks begin to resolve.\nWhile we see a demand environment that remains positive, the invasion of Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China are new developments versus 90 days ago. And let's face it, the supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures continue to linger. On the supply chain, the challenges around material availability and flow, I would tell you are about the same as 90 days ago, but we have seen an uptick in inflationary pressures. I am pleased with how our teams are continuing to manage the supply constraints to meet our obligations to customers, and they are also working additional price increases to partially offset higher costs so that we can maintain margin performance in each segment. We believe that we are differentiated with our global manufacturing strategy and ability to produce in region, and this is helping us to enable the growth in share gains across our business during these volatile times.\nNow with this as an overview, let me get into the slides and discuss a few additional highlights that are on Slide 3. Our quarter 2 sales of $4 billion were up 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.81, which is up 15% year-over-year, with both being records, as I mentioned. From a free cash flow perspective, we generated approximately $615 million in the first half. and we returned approximately $670 million to shareholders in the second quarter, and we did increase the pace of our buybacks during the quarter.\nIf I turn from financials for a minute, I'm also impressed that we continue to be recognized for our ESG initiatives with TE being named among the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for the eighth consecutive year. I am pleased with our commitment and continued progress along our ESG initiatives and also our employees are really leaning in and being engaged on these important initiatives across TE.\nSo let me again touch upon our guidance for the third quarter. We do expect sales of approximately $3.9 billion and this will be up 1% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis versus the prior year. This guidance does include approximately 300 basis points of year-over-year headwinds from the expected COVID-related shutdowns in China that we expect in the quarter. And we do expect adjusted EPS to be approximately $1.75 in the third quarter. So if you could, I'd like you to turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into the order trends and markets a little bit further.\nAt an overall level, our second quarter orders were $4.5 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.13, and it highlights the strong demand that I mentioned already. While TE is not typically a backlog business, we are in an environment where you need to look at both bookings and backlog to get a full picture of demand. Our backlog is up 40% year-over-year and is up significantly in every segment. Importantly, we continue to see stability in our backlog in each segment, and our customers continue to provide order visibility beyond the current quarter to ensure supply certainty in these ongoing volatile markets.\nIn our Transportation segment, we saw order levels increase sequentially, influenced by concerns around the recent developments in Ukraine and China. Global auto production was in line with our expectations in the second quarter at approximately 19 million units, and we expect auto production to decline slightly in the third quarter on a sequential basis. The trends around our content remained robust as we continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles, and we expect electric vehicles to be up approximately 30% this year in production.\nGiven the volatility we're seeing in global auto production and the comparisons that can result as we move through the second half, it is important we look at content per vehicle as an additional long-term metric. Our content per vehicle has expanded from the low $60s range in and pre-COVID times to roughly $80 in fiscal 2021.\nAs we look forward, we expect continued expansion in our content per vehicle from the first half to the second half of this year. When you look beyond the near-term noise in the auto supply chain, we continue to see a favorable setup for our longer-term auto production growth with healthy end demand and dealer inventories that remain extremely low.\nLooking at our Industrial segment orders. We saw another quarter of strong orders with a book-to-bill of 1.22. We continue to see an improving backdrop with increased capital expenditures for factory automation, manufacturing capacity and renewable energy. And these trends benefit both our industrial equipment and energy businesses. We're also continuing to see improving order trends in the comm air as well as favorable conditions in our medical business, and we expect to see favorable year-over-year revenue comparisons in those businesses later in this fiscal year.\nAnd lastly, in Communications, orders continue to reflect strong demand as well. We had a book-to-bill of 1.07. In data and devices, we're seeing a robust outlook for cloud capital expenditures, and we continue to gain share. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect softening in our appliance business from the first half to the second half of this year. And just to add some color on what we're seeing geographically, and I'll do this on an organic basis sequentially. In North America, our orders were up 12%. In Europe, they were up 16%. And in China, our orders were down 4%.\nSo with that overview about orders and markets and what we're seeing, let me get into the segment results that you can see on Slides 5 through 7, and I'll hit on some of the highlights in each of the segments. In our Transportation segment, our sales were up 5% organically year-over-year. Our auto business grew 5% organically versus auto production declines in the mid-single digits. This continues to show the separation of our sales performance versus the market, which is being driven by our leading position in electric vehicles and their increased adoption.\nIn commercial transportation, we saw 5% organic growth driven by North America and Europe, even though the market in China is still going to be down this year, we continue to see significant outperformance in all regions, driven by content growth and share gains.\nAnd in our sensors business, we were roughly flat organically, and we continue to see strong design win momentum in transportation applications. If you look at earnings in the segment, adjusted operating margins were 18.2% as our teams continue to execute well and implement price increases to partially offset the inflationary pressures.\nSo let me turn to the Industrial segment, where our sales increased 11% organically year-over-year. In the industrial equipment business, our sales were up 27% organically with double-digit growth in all regions and continued benefits from increased capital spending and factory automation. In energy, we saw 5% organic growth driven by increased penetration in renewable applications. And in our AD&M and medical business, our sales were both roughly flat. And as I said earlier, we expect improvement in both markets and more favorable comparisons as we go forward. At the segment level, adjusted operating margins expanded year-over-year by 280 basis points to 15.3%, driven by higher volume, price actions and strong operational performance.\nSo let me move to the Communications segment. As you'll see on the slide, our teams continue to execute well while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets that we serve. Sales grew 23% organically year-over-year for this segment, with growth in each business, as you can see on the slide. In our data and devices business, we saw a market outperformance driven by content growth in high-speed cloud and share gains in artificial intelligence applications, which are aimed at improving energy efficiency in data centers. This continues to illustrate how we are enabling a positive impact in carbon emissions across our portfolio through our products and our technologies.\nIn our appliance business, we performed ahead of our expectations, and this is despite the expected declines we saw in the China market. We saw growth in North America and in Europe with continued share gains enabled by our manufacturing strategy to produce close to our customers. This resiliency has proven to be a differentiator as customers navigate the challenges in the macro environment.\nAnd from an earnings perspective, our communications team continues to deliver outstanding performance with adjusted operating margins of 24%, up 330 basis points versus a strong quarter in the prior year. Because of the heavy lifting we've done in the segment around cost reduction and footprint consolidation, we expect segment adjusted operating margins to remain above 20% through the second half even as the appliance market moderates.\nSo with that as an overview of the segments and the markets, let me turn it over to Heath to go into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward.\n\nHeath A. Mitts\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials. Adjusted operating income was $736 million with an adjusted operating margin of 18.4%. GAAP operating income was $705 million and included $21 million of restructuring and other charges and $10 million of acquisition-related charges.\nWe continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million for the full year as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization. Adjusted EPS was $1.81, and GAAP EPS was $1.71 for the quarter and included tax-related items of $0.02. Additionally, we had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of approximately $0.08. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was approximately 19%. For the third quarter, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 20%, and we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 20% for the full year. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well above our adjusted ETR for the full year.\nSo let's turn to Slide 9. Our results that you see on this slide reflect the strong execution of our teams and how we have strategically positioned our portfolio. As Terrence mentioned, we delivered strong results in each segment. Sales of $4 billion, a company record, were up 7% reported and 8% on an organic basis year-over-year. And just to provide some color on our organic growth. Approximately 1/3 of our organic growth was driven by the price increases. Also, currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $116 million versus the prior year.\nAs we look forward into Q3, we expect currency exchange rates to be a sequential headwind of approximately $50 million and a year-over-year headwind of approximately $150 million due to the strength in U.S. dollar. As you may recall, last quarter, we discussed the impacts of currency exchange rates for our fiscal year, and we now expect fiscal '22 impact between $400 million and $500 million headwind from FX. This is about $100 million worse than we were 90 days ago with the majority of that additional impact occurring in our second half of our fiscal year.\nAdjusted EPS of $1.81 was up 15% year-over-year and represents a company record as mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, and I'm pleased with the performance of our team given the incremental inflationary pressures we are seeing. We are pulling price levers across the business to help partially offset these pressures. While we are not able to offset these cost dollar for dollar, we are able to recover approximately 2/3 through price and the remainder through productivity initiatives. As you would assume, we will continue to respond with pricing levers to mitigate the impacts in this environment.\nTurning to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operating activities was $413 million. Free cash for the quarter was $242 million. As we mentioned last quarter for the year-over-year trend in free cash flow reflects strategic inventory builds. We expect free cash flow to increase significantly in the second half of the year versus the first half and expect inventory levels to stabilize as we move through the year. We increased the pace of our share buyback in the quarter and returned approximately $670 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through the first half, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders.\nWe remain committed to our disciplined use of capital. And over time, we still expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and 1/3 to be used for bolt-on acquisitions. So before we go to questions, I want to reiterate some of the key points that we covered today. We are continuing to execute well in a volatile environment, demonstrate sales growth, margin resiliency and EPS expansion. We remain in a strong demand environment as evidenced by our orders and backlog and the ability to produce will be a key factor of our near-term revenue performance.\nWe have strategically positioned TE around well-recognized secular growth trends, and we continue to generate performance ahead of the markets we serve. Our teams continue to prove their ability to execute in this volatile environment, effectively serving our customers while managing price and cost dynamics, and we continue to demonstrate resilience through our global manufacturing strategy. So with that, let's now turn it up for questions.\nAudrey, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?"

    "content": "Q4 2021 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2021 Telenor ASA Earnings Call\n\nTELOSLOFEB 2, 3:00 AM\n\nSigve Brekke\n\nPresident & Group CEO, Telenor ASA\n\nGood morning, everyone. 2021 was an eventful year for Telenor. We had COVID effects throughout the year, especially in Asia, and the effect lasted longer than what we had expected. However, despite COVID and mostly remote working, we continued with our modernization. And we announced also 2 large mergers in both Malaysia and in Thailand. In 2021, we also had to handle a very challenging situation in Myanmar. It is now 1 year since the military takeover in Myanmar. Throughout the year, our focus has been to safeguard our employees and to continue to serve our customers.\nAnd as you know, given the circumstances, it became impossible for us to remain in Myanmar and the sale was concluded at the least detrimental solution, both to our employees and to our customers. And currently, we are waiting for the authorities approval of this transaction. In this extreme situation, I will say that I have huge respect for the strength and the resilience shown by our team on the ground in Myanmar and what they have been able to do during the last year.\nLooking back on the year, I'm very pleased for what we have achieved. After several years of modernization and transformation, we are now well positioned to take part in the revenue growth that we see now across our portfolio. Our robust operation demonstrate that we despite uncertainties and COVID effects are able to safeguard EBITDA and cash flow. And as a result of this, we delivered a solid cash flow of NOK 13 billion last year. And this is supporting a proposed dividend for the financial year of 2021 of NOK 9.30. This is in line with the dividend policy that we have been following now for several years.\n2021 was a year where we started to see real opportunities for 5G. I'm pleased to see that Telenor that we are able to monetize on what we call the first wave of services towards the consumer segment. An important part of this is also the fixed wireless access product that our customers see as a good alternative to fees broadband. We continue to upgrade our customers from 4G to 5G speed and together with partners, we have also started to build services on top of traditional connectivity. And during the year, you see this demonstrated through the ARPU increase we see now both in Norway and in Finland.\nWe are now entering what I call the second wave of 5G, which will be focused on services towards the B2B segment. Telenor has already delivered the first private networks, both here in Norway, in Finland and in Sweden. In these deliveries, revenues from services like edge and security may often be even higher than the connectivity itself. This is an excellent example on how these opportunities, which we refer to as beyond connectivity, that's the term we are using for it, need the connectivity as a basis to be realized. And to enable ourselves to take this potential revenue opportunities, we have also signed up global strategic partnerships with hyperscalers like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service.\nWe are also executing on our strategic agenda in Asia. We believe there will be significant growth opportunities in Asia coming from both the B2C and the B2B segment. I'm going to talk more about that later in the presentation. In the midst of the COVID lockdown, we announced in April a merger between Digi and Celcom in Malaysia. And in Q4, we also announced an intention to merge our operations in Thailand, dtac and True. This transaction aims at creating a market-leading company in Thailand, and this will provide the opportunities for value creation for our operation in the country.\nAnd now let me move into the results, starting with Norway. In Norway, our team is running what I called an ambitious agenda. They are building a legacy-free, future-proof network. At the same time, they are modernizing and digitalizing the entire operation. And on top of that, we are also now starting to see sizable revenues coming from services on top of data connectivity. Norway continues to see growth both in mobile and in fixed future revenues. And the sale of services in combination with demand for more data is driving the ARPU improvement. This quarter, however, the growth in fixed future revenues is lower than previous period as a result of lower run rate of new fiber and fixed wireless access connections.\nIn January 2019, we announced the decision to close the copper network. And looking back, this was a bold decision. And since then, we have experienced a revenue decline of NOK 2.1 billion, and you can see that illustrated in the middle of this slide. When we made that decision, we set a target of maintaining 60% of the customers and 70% of the revenue. The result so far is around 85% revenue retention. This is very pleased to see these results. The program is now moving into the final year, and we estimate a headwind of approximately NOK 900 million from the decommissioning in 2022. The modernization continues in Norway, and the underlying EBITDA is almost flat due to another quarter with strong OpEx reduction from the Norwegian team.\nThen to the rest of the Nordics. Finland and Denmark both delivered strong ARPU growth of 3% and 6%, respectively in the quarter. In Finland, mobile upselling is driving improved ARPU in combination with growth in the consumer segment for fixed broadband. We do now cover 65% of the population in Finland with our 5G network. And we see that both speed and quality in our 5G network is very competitive. The DNA performance is even better than what we expected when we acquired that company 2 years ago. I will especially mention DNA's customer-centric operation and the way they have built a very strong DNA brand. And these are also examples on areas that we are taking learning into other Telenor operations.\nIn Denmark, we see another strong quarter. Telenor Denmark is true. It's significant digital modernization, able to take down cost and at the same time, improve customer journeys. As one example, 80% now of our customers are being served by digital channels. As a result, we are able to grow ARPU and also increase profitability in this very competitive market. This transformation activities have improved the EBITDA margin in Denmark with 15 percent points over the last 6 years. When they started this turnaround operation, the EBITDA margin back in 2015 was 11%. Last year, it was 26%. I see this as an impressive performance.\nThe stabilization in Sweden continues. I'm also pleased to see that what I believe are positive effects of our revamp to go-to-the-market strategy. We delivered strong customer intake of 25,000 new customers in the quarter, which 13,000 are coming from Telenor's main brand within B2C and SME. As I have mentioned before, we believe Sweden is a growth market, and that Telenor Sweden should be able to grow in line with the market growth.\nThen moving to Asia. In Asia, we see pandemic continues -- continue to ease off, but it took longer time than what we expected last year. I have shown this graph for you several quarters in a row, and it is to illustrate the effects of the COVID waves. How -- what we see now is that vaccination rates are increasing. And with that, we see increased activities and mobility across our footprint. And we see the growth with that is coming back. We are therefore prepared to invest to position ourselves for this growth. And we see this already happening in Bangladesh. And that's why you see on the graph as little uptick on -- in the end of the quarter.\nDuring 2021, despite the volatility and uncertainty, we have experienced a continued increase in data usage. In the quarter, we saw an almost 40% increase in average data usage across our portfolio in Asia. We see an opportunity to monetize this growing data demand with upselling and also implementation of digital services. This is also driven by an increased smartphone penetration and an increase in digital payment solution to enable digital top-ups. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, for example, 30% of all the top-up is now happening digitally. While in Thailand, the digital sale is almost 80%.\nWe are meeting this increasing data demand by building the most efficient and modern data network. To give you a number, over the last 5 years, we have seen around 4x higher data volume. However, at the same time, our network modernization and efficiency programs have delivered a 4x decrease in cost. We have by this managed to decouple the data growth and the data cost. Both the need for efficient data production and the ability to build a service universe is depending on scale. And this is an important driver behind the consolidation thinking we have in Asia.\n2 years ago, we saw the potential of strengthening our B2B position in our Asian business units. And we now see a strong development in this segment. Although this is currently a relatively small proportion of the revenues during the year and despite the pandemic, we see a double-digit growth within the segment, which we also expect to continue in the coming years.\nI will talk a little bit about what we do on the technology area. Over the last years, our technology modernization has had the ambition of transforming Telenor into becoming what we call a digital telco. And today, I would like to claim that this has positioned us in the industry forefront. To give you some examples of what we have done so far, 90% of our data traffic is now in the cloud infrastructure. 65% of our network applications and almost 50% of our IT applications are also moved to the cloud. We have implemented process simplification, automatization and use of AI to move towards what we call a touch-free operation by 2023.\nAnd with this, we have also made significant steps to digitalize customer interaction, both in sales and customer care. We see that with 5G as a discom with a unique opportunity, both in the B2B and in the B2C segment. Connectivity will become even more important in a digital future and will continue to be the base for our services. But we believe that we can do more than deliver on the data connectivity. And our ambition is therefore, to move beyond traditional connectivity services.\nIn our digital telco strategy, a central element is to unbundle our value chain into modules. And when we do this, we can increase the optionality, and we can start offering those modules as a service, as a service solution, both internally and externally. Examples of that you already see on connectivity as a service are private networks. They're also 5G private networks that they are already delivering in the Nordics and software-defined networks that we also now start to take a position on -- in the Nordics. Another example is what we do in our spinoff company Work Group 2. They have developed a cloud native core platform that we are using already in the digital brand we have in Sweden, and they are also taking positions in other OpCos. And we see a potential also in the future to do the same in the consumer segment.\nThen let me end with giving you some key priorities for 2022. Firstly, the priority is to grow in the Nordics based on monetization of 5G and services on top of traditional connectivity. It's about adding value to the consumers, building on our consumer customer relationship and on our strong brands and presence in these markets. In the B2B segment, customers are digitalizing their processes and systems to become more efficient, to grow faster and also expand into new areas. And I believe this service beyond connectivity is a significant growth opportunity in our Nordic business units and then later in Asia.\nMy second priority is to strengthen the position we have in Asia. Our ambition is to be a leading regional telco in Southeast Asia, whether it's catering for data growth, serving new segments or delivering on demands for new services, we need scale to be part in these new opportunities. In all our Asian markets, the governments are having digital ambitions. We therefore see an opportunity to be a part of realizing this. And this is why we are stepping up our efforts in the B2B and the SME segment.\nThe third priority is to develop our infrastructure operations into being a leading Nordic player. Telenor Infra in Norway has been operational for 2 years and has confirmed the assumptions we had in our business plan. So far, as you can see on this slide, we have increased external revenues with 12%. Infra -- Telenor Infra has also delivered increased quality of service and confirmed our belief in the model and that we are able to realize operational synergies.\nAnd in addition, it's all based of -- on our responsible business conduct approach. Telenor is here to empower societies. And a key differentiator for Telenor is how we conduct our business responsibility. We have the same standards across our diverse markets. And with this, our operations are impacting the societies where we operate. We are proud of this. And although it challenge us from time to time, we also see that it helps us to build trust towards our customers and towards our stakeholders.\nAnd with this, I leave the floor to Tone.\n\nTone Hegland Bachke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Telenor ASA\n\nThank you, Sigve, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting back on 2021, it has been another year where COVID has had implications on our business, and we did expect, as Sigve said, a stronger recovery in Asia in the second half of the year. However, and despite COVID, it has been a year where Telenor has demonstrated the strength of our operating model and the quality of our people. Thanks to our Asian setup and the team's impressive and structured work. We have launched and are currently executing on 2 large merger processes in Thailand and Malaysia, despite these markets being severely impacted by COVID and lockdowns.\nWe have also, as Sigve said, handled the very unfortunate situation as it has evolved in Myanmar. In the fourth quarter, Telenor Myanmar are delivering a very strong financial result in an extremely challenging situation. This is a testament of the quality of our people and the strength of our operating model in the country. In our financial accounts, Telenor Myanmar is treated as a discontinued operation and net asset values are impaired. Further, over the last 2 years, we have demonstrated our capabilities to navigate in uncertain [TN] opportunities that we have experienced in a very special time.\nIn this period, we have worked diligently to safeguard EBITDA and cash flow, and all these efforts have enabled Telenor to deliver robust result in the second year of COVID. So in 2021, we are delivering stable S&T revenues for both the year and the quarter. EBITDA for the year also remained stable. In the fourth quarter, we see a 1% EBITDA decrease as we were not able to fully offset the loss of the high-margin copper revenues and the increased cost related to sales and marketing, energy and also structural transactions. Free cash flow came in at NOK 13 billion.\nLet us now have a closer look at the figures, and I start with revenues. As I said, the organic S&T revenue remained stable, both for the quarter and the year. If we exclude the effects of the copper decommissioning, we deliver S&T growth of around 1%, both for the quarter and for the year. In the quarter, we see continued solid performance in Finland and Denmark with a 3% and 2% growth, respectively. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, we continued to deliver growth this quarter of 5% and 4%, respectively. In both these markets, this is driven by our granular market approach throughout the year.\nIn Norway, we see a 3% reduction in total S&T revenues or 1% if we exclude a positive one-off last year. For the underlying performance, continued growth in mobile and fixed non-legacy services, we are not able to fully offset the reduction in copper revenues. Delay in some fiber projects has moved installation volume over to 2022. In Sweden, as Sigve said, the revenues were in line with last year. We have invested in market activities, and we are pleased to see positive effects through a strong customer intake of 25,000. And we are particularly pleased that we now manage to turn in net positive adds in both the B2C main brand and the SME segment.\nIn Thailand, the country has been more or less completely closed for tourists throughout 2021. However, dtac has continued to adapt and has implemented a more domestic focused strategy, which results in close to 300,000 net subscriptions added this quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the S&T revenues remained stable, while on the year, they were down 1%. So to the full year. In the Nordics, we see 2% growth across mobile and fixed revenues. However, this is offset by the copper decline in Norway, and this is why the Nordics overall deliver stable compared to last year. In Asia, the COVID effects continued and Bangladesh is an important growth engine. But overall, Asia delivers neutral growth.\nAnd now to the OpEx. For 2021, we delivered an OpEx reduction of 2% on top of the 7% we delivered in 2020. In the fourth quarter alone, we see a slight increase in OpEx for the group of approximately 1%. But as you might remember, we had a very strong reduction of 7% in the same quarter last year. We continue to deliver OpEx reductions in several categories, but sales and marketing cost, energy and M&A costs are higher this quarter. Last year, we said that we expected some of the costs in the sales and marketing area to come back once the opportunities for growth returned. And particularly in Bangladesh and Sweden are examples where we see this in the fourth quarter.\nLooking at the OpEx per country, we see material cost reductions in Norway and Thailand driven by structural programs. The largest increase this quarter is seen in Bangladesh, which is driven by the network in IT and also sales and marketing costs. In the other segment, this is primarily driven by NOK 75 million of increase of M&A cost from the 3 large M&A projects we are currently running in Asia. For the full year 2021, structural initiatives more than offset increased costs related to sales and marketing and energy. In 2020, we said that we had positive contributions from COVID on OpEx spend of approximately NOK 900 million, of which more than half was related to sales and marketing costs. As the situation is stabilizing, parts of these costs will gradually come back.\nAn important topic these days is inflationary cost pressure, and I would like to share some insight on how we see this. For the last 5 years, modernization and structured programs has become an integrated part of how we work in Telenor. And over the course of these years, we estimate that we have been able to reduce OpEx by close to 15%. As we now move into a more high inflationary environment, I believe this way of work will be a very strong tool to handle the cost increases and inflation going forward. On this slide, you see some examples of 2 areas in scope for our structural modernization initiatives, namely organization and energy. In 2021, we were able to more than offset the salary increase across our portfolio with FTE reductions coming from the structural programs such as simplification and digitalization.\nFor energy, we are running group wide projects to improve energy efficiency and support our climate agenda to reduce CO2 emissions. This project looks at network optimization and other energy savings to reduce both energy costs and consumption. Had it not been for these efforts, the increase in energy usage would have been even higher in 2021, estimated to around 4%. Finally, on this topic, I would like to mention our centralized procurement company in Singapore. This company is negotiating prices on equipment and services purchased by throughout Telenor. In total, we estimate that centralized procurement has realized approximately savings of approximately NOK 15 billion since 2017. This is then both OpEx and CapEx. Going forward, modernization will continue to be a strong tool to cope with inflation and cost increases.\nNow to the EBITDA. The organic EBITDA was stable for the year and decreased by 1% in the fourth quarter. The EBITDA performance in the quarter is impacted by a reduction in the high-margin copper revenue of NOK 200 million, high project cost and also the energy prices, particularly in Norway. In the quarter, we see solid performance in Finland and Bangladesh. In addition, we see positive contribution from Thailand driven primarily by special items last year and lease reclassification.\nEven though Norway has material positive impact from OpEx reductions this quarter, the peak of the copper decommissioning on the top line is also impacting the EBITDA. This is also impacting the group EBITDA negatively by close to 1 percentage point. In the other category, increased energy cost in our infrastructure company in Norway and higher costs related to increased activity level and M&A were the main contributors to the negative impact of 1.3 percentage points.\nMoving to towers. As of year-end '21, Telenor has around 21,000 fully owned sites, and we have additionally 10,000 sites that we own together with our joint venture partners in Sweden and Denmark. This asset base in total brings Telenor into being the fifth largest tower company in Europe actually. We have tenancy ratios of 1.4 in Finland, 2.3 in Sweden. And in our largest portfolio in Norway, the tenancy ratio is 1.6. In addition to working on increasing the external revenue, we are, as Sigve also said, focusing on improving the operation and efficiency of the towers. We are developing our Nordic tower portfolio to be a leading tower company in Nordics.\nFrom the first quarter, we will start reporting financials for the fully owned assets. This includes our passive tower infrastructure insights in Norway, in Finland and parts of the portfolio in Sweden. The towers that is owned through our joint ventures will not be included in our financial reporting from the start. We are executing on a 3-step strategy when it comes to towers. Firstly, we are focusing on improving the operations. The second priority is to visualize financials, which we will start doing from the next quarter. And then the third step will be to evaluate strategic options.\nMoving to net income. Reported net income to equity holders of Telenor ASA in the fourth quarter was NOK 0.6 billion, a decrease of NOK 7.1 billion compared to last year. For the full year '21, net income to equity holders of Telenor ASA was NOK 1.5 billion. The decrease compared to last year was primarily driven by NOK 7.4 billion negative impact from impairment of Myanmar and also the gain of disposal last year of total NOK 5.8 billion. In addition, we see negative currency effects from a strong Norwegian kroner on EBITDA and net financial items of, in total, NOK 4.9 billion for 2021. Adjusted for the nonoperational items, meaning the impairment and the currency effects, this year's net income would have been around the same level as the dividend.\nMoving to cash flow. CapEx in the fourth quarter amounted to NOK 5.9 billion. In Norway, the 5G rollout and copper decommissioning is running at full speed and is supporting our superior network and laying the foundation for future service revenue growth. In addition, 5G investments in Finland and coverage expansion in Thailand are key elements to the CapEx spend. CapEx to sales ratio for the quarter was 20.8% and 16.3% for the full year. Cash flow for the quarter was negative NOK 0.5 billion. Free cash flow was impacted by NOK 2.3 billion in spectrum payment in Thailand and payment of the competition fine in Norway of NOK 800 million.\nCompared to EBITDA, now compared to last year, EBITDA is down due to currency. The cash flow this quarter also includes a contribution of NOK 400 million related to Myanmar. Total cash flow for the year stands at NOK 12.7 billion and NOK 1.3 billion of the cash flow related to Myanmar. The leverage ratio increased to 2.05 this time and ended by this -- the year exactly in the mid-range of our target range. Going forward, we will continue to look for value-accretive transactions, which are in line with the strategy and which visualize the value in the portfolio. As an example, yesterday, we closed the transaction in Sweden and received almost NOK 3 billion for our open universe communication provider, and this will be booked in our accounts for the first quarter.\nThen to the dividends. Based on the financial results for 2021, the Board proposes a dividend of NOK 9.3 per share for 2021. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of NOK 13 billion to the shareholders. The proposed dividend is in line with our dividend policy and gives a dividend yield of 6.5% and implies a 3% increase in ordinary dividend per share compared to 2020. Telenor has, over the last 2 years, demonstrated a strong commitment to the dividend policy despite the business being severely impacted by COVID. This has been done on the basis of how we are financially managing the operation when it comes to investment levels, cash flow, leverage and dividends. We end 2021 with a solid cash flow while being in the middle of the leverage range. Over the last 6 years, we have returned close to NOK 100 billion to the shareholders. The dividend will, as usual, be paid in 2 tranches in May and October.\nAnd lastly, I'll conclude the presentation with the outlook for 2022. In 2021, we have seen that the performance in Asia continued to be impacted by the pandemic. And although we still wait for the recovery, we see signs of improvements across our portfolio, and we believe this will provide growth in the coming year. As Sigve mentioned, we now see growth opportunities both from services in the Nordics and from data migration and B2B services in Asia. These opportunities arise within the traditionally connectivity services, with also from services on top on connectivity. Going forward, we will, therefore, report and provide outlook, including these revenues. We believe this will provide an updated performance measure more in line with our strategy.\nAs we expect the transaction in Malaysia to close during the second quarter, we now provide an outlook without Digi. For 2022, we expect low single-digit growth in service revenue, while EBITDA will be around 2021 level or slightly higher. This guiding reflects our belief in returning to growth in 2022, while the EBITDA will be impacted by investments in market activities, high project and M&A activities and this being the last year of the copper decommissioning in Norway. In sum, this leads to an EBITDA growth, which is lagging some quarters behind the top line development.\nAs we expect growth opportunities from 5G and continue the fiber land grab and copper decommissioning in Norway, together with the network expansion we do in Asia in 2022, we see CapEx to sales for the next year in the range of 16% to 70%. We believe this represents an investment into future profitable growth for the group. And as such, we believe that 2021 and '22 will be peak years for Telenor when it comes to CapEx. However, for the period 2020 to 2022, we are within the midterm outlook of around 15%, which we communicated at the last CMD. We will go more into detail for how we see the medium-term going forward outlook for the Telenor Group, including our strategy for growth in the Nordics, in beyond connectivity in Asia and in infrastructure on a Capital Markets Day, which will take place later this year. We will come back to the date for this in our first quarter presentation.\nAnd with this, Sigve, we wrap up the presentation and open the floor for Q&A. Moderator, may we have the first question, please?"

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.\n\nSujal Shah\n\nVP of IR, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's first quarter 2022 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.\nDuring this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. (Operator Instructions)\nNow let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin\n\nCEO & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nYes. Thank you, Sujal, and also thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our results for our first quarter along with our outlook for the second quarter of our fiscal 2022. As I normally do and before Heath and I take you through the slides, I want to provide some key takeaways that (inaudible) from our performance relative to the broader environment that we continue to operate in. Our results represent a strong start to our fiscal year in a world that continues to have challenges. Our first quarter builds upon the strong momentum that we demonstrated throughout our fiscal 2021, and things aren't playing out as we expected, including the outlook for our markets. We also continue to be excited about the growth opportunities where we have positioned TE around as well as the strong operational performance of our teams to expand margins and drive earnings and cash flow growth as we go forward.\nIn our first quarter, we delivered strong results in each segment. On a year-over-year basis, in quarter 1, we delivered sales growth of 8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, along with operating margins of 18.6%, which are up 90 basis points over last year. On an EPS perspective, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 was a record for our first quarter. The demand environment also continues to be strong as evidenced by the orders that we'll talk about, and our orders remained [above] $4 billion in the quarter, and what you'll see is this reflects strength across many of our end markets and provides a positive indicator of ongoing future growth. What we like about our performance in the first quarter is that it continues to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio. Our Industrial and Communications segment grew over 20% and 40%, respectively, more than offsetting expected impact from the mid-teen auto production declines that impacted our Transportation segment.\nAlso, you continue to see in our results the benefits of where we strategically positioned our engineering investments around certain secular trends. This is generating market outperformance in each of our segments as a result of this positioning. The content growth is real, and we continue to benefit from our leading position in electric vehicles, factory automation as well as cloud applications. 20% of our sales are now driven by hybrid and electric vehicles, and we continue to see ongoing content growth in auto around electronification across both electric and combustion engine platforms. We are also generating content outperformance from automation and an Internet of Things in manufacturing and higher speeds and greater efficiency in the data center. And also, throughout today's presentation, I think it's going to show our teams continue to execute well in a challenging supply chain environment and is clearly reflected in our first quarter results as well as our second quarter guidance. We are also pleased that we continue to generate performance that is in line with our long-term business model goals. And our first quarter results, when you look with our second quarter guidance, implying a first half growth of 5% growth in sales and 13% growth in adjusted EPS versus the first half of last year, along with continued margin expansion.\nThis strong performance is within a backdrop of global GDP growth environment and higher end demand across most end markets where we've strategically positioned TE. We are seeing broad strength in capital expenditures that relate to factory automation, expansion and manufacturing capacity cloud and data center investment as well as investment in renewable energy sources. If you look on the consumer side of the economy, demand for autos remains healthy with auto production improving sequentially in our first quarter, and we continue to see content growth to drive market outperformance in both our commercial transportation and auto businesses. We continue to see expansion in our content per vehicle driven by our leading position in electric vehicles as well as ongoing expansion of electronification in both internal combustion and EV platforms, and we clearly expect that this trend is going to continue as we move forward. Certainly, while this demand environment is positive, we are still in a world that deals with COVID as well as supply chain challenges. The supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures that we've been discussing since the onset of COVID are slightly worse than 90 days ago. What I do want to highlight that I'm pleased with how we are managing through this and making continued progress towards our business model goals despite these ongoing factors. With the healthy demand in the current state of the global supply chains, our ability to produce will be a key factor of our near-term revenue performance. We continue to benefit from our global manufacturing strategy to produce in region, and our teams continue to drive price actions and productivity initiatives across all 3 of our segments.\nSo with that as a backdrop, let me now turn to the slides and discuss some additional highlights, and I'll start on Slide 3. Our quarter 1 sales of $3.8 billion were up 8% on both the reported and organic basis, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.76, which is up 20% year-over-year and a record for our first quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating margins were 18.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by the growth and strong operational performance in our Industrial and Communications segments. We do continue to see a strong demand environment, which is reflected in orders of $4.3 billion, and I'll get into more details on the orders on the next slide.\nLooking at free cash flow, we generated approximately $370 million of free cash flow in the quarter, and we returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends during the quarter. And moving away from financials for a minute, I do want to highlight that we continue to be recognized for our ESG initiatives, and we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the tenth consecutive year along with our recent ranking in the top 20 of Investor Business Daily's 100 Best ESG Companies. I think, importantly, we remain committed to our goal of decreasing Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by over 40% on an absolute basis by 2030, which is above and beyond the 27% reduction that we've already made over the past decade. And while I've talked about our team's performance about their execution, let's face it, to make these sustainability investments, it's also how our employees engage in that as well. And I'm very pleased with the progress of how our employees are engaging as we drive sustainability initiatives across TE.\nSo let me turn to guidance for the second quarter. And we expect that the strong performance of our portfolio to continue in our second quarter with approximately $3.8 billion in sales, and this will be up 2% on a reported basis and 3% organically versus the prior year, despite the year-over-year decline in auto production. We expect double-digit growth in both Industrial and Communications segments to drive our second quarter growth, once again reinforcing the diversity of our portfolio. We do expect adjusted EPS to be approximately $1.70 in the second quarter, and this will be up 8% year-over-year.\nSo now let me get into the order trends and markets and if you could please turn to Slide 4, where you see our order progression by our segments. For the first quarter, our orders were $4.3 billion and our book-to-bill was 1.13, and we saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our Industrial and Communications segments. In our largest segment, Transportation, order levels came in as we expected, and our book-to-bill was 1.0, which aligns closely to auto production trends. Global auto production came in slightly better than we expected in the first quarter at approximately 19 million units, and we expect that auto production will remain at a similar level in the second quarter, reflecting roughly a 5% reduction year-over-year in auto production. We continue to anticipate that auto production will improve in the second half compared to the first half and will return to year-over-year growth as we move through 2022. In addition to production, the trends around content remained strong, and we continue to expect outperformance to be at the high end of our 4 to 6 range in 2022 as we continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles, which we expect will be up over 30% globally this year. Now when you think about transportation, there are certainly ongoing challenges with semiconductors and the broader supply chain that continue to be a governor for our auto customer's ability to produce. When you look beyond the near-term noise in the auto supply chain, we continue to see a favorable setup for longer-term auto production growth with healthy consumer demand and dealer inventories that remain extremely low.\nSo let me turn to the Industrial segment orders. And what's nice is, for the first time since the onset of COVID, sequential orders strengthened across all businesses in the segment. We see an improving backdrop with increased capital expenditures for factory automation, manufacturing capacity related to electric vehicle infrastructure and semiconductors as well as investments in renewable energy, and this increased capital investment benefits our industrial equipment and energy businesses in the segment. On top of that strength, we've seen improved order trends in our comm air and Medical businesses that we expect to begin to see favorable year-over-year revenue comparisons in those business later this fiscal year. If you look at our Communications segment, our order growth in the first quarter was driven entirely by our data and devices business and reflects an increased outlook for cloud capital expenditures as well as our ongoing share momentum. We also see with our D&D customers, they're placing orders out for delivery beyond the current quarter due to the broader supply chain uncertainty. While we continue to see favorable end market trends in D&D, we are seeing a moderation of the appliance market as we expected, particularly in China, and we would expect softening in the appliance market from the first half to the second half of our fiscal year.\nWith that overview of orders and markets by the segments, let me add some color on what we're seeing organically from a geographic perspective, and I'll start on a sequential basis. In Asia Pacific, and I'll exclude China here, those orders were up 18%, while in China, orders were up 4% sequentially. And outside of Asia, all orders were essentially flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, organically, again, Asia Pacific, excluding China orders, were up 18%. North America and China orders were up 17% and 2%, respectively, and we saw a slight decline in Europe of approximately 4%.\nSo with that backdrop around orders and markets, let me get into briefly discover year-over-year segment results, and that's laid out on Slides 5 through 7. And as I added a lot of color, I'll just hit the high points here. In Transportation, our sales were down 2% organically year-over-year with declines in auto, partially offset by growth in commercial transportation and sensors. Our auto business declined 6% organically versus auto production declines that were in the mid-teens. Once again, you see the separation of our sales performance versus the market due to the content growth. TE's technology and products are enabling high-voltage architectures and applications with every leading customer and 20% of our sales are now driven by hybrid and electric vehicle platforms. In commercial transportation, we saw 11% organic growth with outperformance versus the market due to content growth drivers that are very similar to our auto business. And in sensors, we saw 5% organic growth driven by industrial applications as well as new ramps in transportation applications. From a margin perspective in the segment, adjusted operating margins came in as we expected at 18.2%.\nNow moving to Industrial segment results. Our sales increased 18% organically year-over-year. In the industrial equipment area, we were up 40% organically with strong growth in all regions, and we're benefiting from the increased capital investment and spending across the globe. In our Energy business, we saw 17% organic growth that's driven by our increased penetration in renewable applications that we've talked about with you. And in our medical business, it grew 8% organically as we're starting to benefit from the recovery in interventional procedures. And in our Aerospace and Defense business, our sales declined 3%, which is organically driven by the market dynamics in that space, but certainly, our orders show a more positive outlook as we move forward. From a margin perspective in the Industrial segment, our adjusted operating margins expanded year-over-year by 130 basis points to 14.8% driven by higher volume as well as the strong operational performance by our teams.\nSo let me turn to the Communications segment. And I just want to start that, you look at the performance of both businesses as well as the margin performance, it just shows that our teams continue to execute while capitalizing on growth trends in the markets we serve. Sales grew 40% organically year-over-year for the segment with strong growth in each of our businesses, as you can see on the slide. In data and devices, we saw strong growth across all regions, driven by content growth and share gains in high-speed cloud applications as our customers move towards 400-gig and next-generation chip platforms as well as growth in server and artificial intelligence applications. In appliances, we saw growth in all regions with continued share gains as we continue to differentiate with our customers around our global manufacturing network. And from a margin perspective, the performance was outstanding, with another record in adjusted operating margins of 27%, which was up 950 basis points year-over-year, which was strong performance in the prior year as well. If you just take a step back and you look across the segments, our teams continue to capitalize on the growth trends in their end markets, demonstrating the diversity of our portfolio. and delivering operational execution with both pricing actions within the challenging supply chain environment.\nSo with that as an overview, let me give it to Heath, and he'll get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward.\n\nHeath A. Mitts\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Executive Director, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nThank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $712 million with an adjusted operating margin of 18.6%. The GAAP operating income was $672 million and included $24 million of restructuring and other charges and $16 million of acquisition-related charges. We continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million for the full year as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 and GAAP EPS was $1.72 for the quarter and included a tax planning related benefit of $0.05. Additionally, we had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.09. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was approximately 18%, and for the second quarter, we expect our tax rate to be very similar to Q1. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be around 19%. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our adjusted ETR for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our results, you see on the slide, reflect the strong execution of our teams and the diversity of our portfolio. As Terrence mentioned, each segment contributed to the strong start to our fiscal year. Sales of $3.8 billion were up 8% on both a reported and organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $45 million versus the prior year and were worse than expected. We expect currency exchange rates to be a sequential headwind from Q1 to Q2 and the year-over-year headwind of approximately $110 million in the second quarter. And if the dollar remains at current levels relative to other currencies, FX could be a headwind of approximately $300 million to $400 million for our full fiscal year. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 20% year-over-year, represents a record for the first quarter, as mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating margins were 18.6% and expanded 90 basis points versus the prior year and the incremental flow-through on the adjusted margins and revenue growth were approximately 30% in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. I am pleased with our performance given the inflationary pressures we are seeing and the challenges in the broader supply chain, and as Terrence mentioned, we are pulling pricing leverage across the businesses to help offset those inflationary pressures.\nTurning to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from operating activities was $532 million, Free cash flow for the quarter was $373 million. The year-over-year cash -- the year-over-year trend in free cash flow reflects the strategic inventory builds to meet anticipated customer demand as we mentioned last quarter. In Q1, we returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As noted in our recent proxy filing, we proposed a 12% increase to our dividend that we expect to be approved by shareholders in March. We remain committed to our disciplined use of capital, and over time, we still expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and 1/3 to be used for bolt-on acquisitions.\nSo before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we are executing well despite the challenges we discussed in the broader supply chain. Our results for the quarter demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio with strong operational performance from each of our 3 segments. The demand environment continues to be strong as evidenced by our orders, which reflects strength across many of our markets and provides a positive indicator of future growth. You are continuing to see market outperformance in each of our 3 segments as a result of our strategic positioning around secular trends, and we continue to benefit from our leading position in electric vehicles, factory automation and cloud applications. We continue to generate performance that is in line with our business model goals, and we are excited about the growth and margin expansion opportunities as we go forward.\nSo now let's open it up for questions. Rob, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?"

My name is Diego, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Greg MacLeod, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGreg MacLeod\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Diego. Good afternoon, and welcome to The Southern Company's Third quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and David Poroch, Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent securities filings.\nIn addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Womack\n\nExecutive VP & President of External Affairs, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Greg, and good afternoon to everyone, and we thank you for joining us for today's update. Southern Company continues to perform exceptionally well. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the third quarter, meaningfully above the estimate provided last quarter, and we expect to deliver on our financial objectives for 2025. And I have to say Southern Company has an incredibly bright future ahead.\nOur state-regulated electric and gas utilities continue to provide long-term value to the more than 9 million customers across the Southeast and beyond with reliable and affordable energy. The vertically integrated markets in which our electric utilities operate continue to provide transparent and orderly processes and have consistently supported our ability to meet the needs of our growing economies and electric demand while providing premier reliability and resilient service day in and day out. We've done all of this while keeping customers' rates more than 10% below the national average. Further, the rate plan extension at Georgia Power, which freezes base rates until at least 2029, excluding the recovery of storm-related costs, is a testament to the benefits of a constructive regulatory framework and our focus on balancing growth and affordability.\nCustomers continue to be at the center of everything we do. Our focus on the customer underpins our disciplined approach to forecasting, pricing, contracting and deploying resources to serve this once-in-a-generation growth opportunity. And we continue to execute on those plans for the benefits of all of our customers. Over the last 2 months, we have 4 contracts with large customers across Georgia and Alabama, representing over 2 gigawatts of demand. Consistent with our approach across Southern Company, these contracts include pricing and terms that are designed to pay for the incremental cost to serve new customer demand while also benefiting and protecting existing customers, helping to ensure growth does not come at the expense of affordability.\nI will now turn the call over to David to give an update on our financial performance.\n\nDavid P. Poroch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of 2025, our adjusted EPS was $1.60 per share, $0.10 above our estimate and $0.17 higher than the third quarter of 2024. The primary drivers for our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state-regulated utilities, along with strong customer growth and increased customer usage. These positive drivers were partially offset by milder than normal year-over-year weather, higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest costs.\nFor the 9 months ended September 30, 2025, and our adjusted EPS was $3.76 compared to adjusted earnings of $3.56 for the same period in 2024. Year-to-date, revenue grew at our state-regulated electrics, partially influenced by customer growth and higher usage, which has added $0.12 year-over-year. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning.\nOur adjusted EPS estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.54 per share, which, combined with our year-to-date performance, would represent full year adjusted earnings at the top of our 2025 annual guidance range of $4.30 per share.\nTurning now to retail electricity sales. Year-to-date weather-normal retail electricity sales were 1.8% higher compared to the first 3 quarters of 2024. Year-over-year weather-normal retail electricity sales, which are on pace for the highest annual increase since 2010, excluding the pandemic, demonstrate growth across all 3 customer classes. In the third quarter alone, the commercial sector grew 3.5% on a weather-normal basis compared to the third quarter of 2024. This growth was driven partially by increased sales to existing and new customers -- and new data centers, which were up 17%. Weather-normal residential sales also showed strong growth and were 2.7% higher than in the third quarter of 2024, bolstered by the addition of roughly 12,000 new electric customers in the quarter, substantially higher than historical trends.\nElectricity sales to individual customers also demonstrated continued strength, growing 1.5% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Year-to-date, all of our largest industrial customer segments are up year-over-year, including primary metals, paper and transportation segments, which were each up 4% or higher through the first 3 quarters.\nEconomic development activity across our electric service territories remains robust with 22 companies making announcements to either establish or expand operations in our service territories during the third quarter, generating nearly 5,000 potential new jobs and representing expected capital investments totaling approximately $2.8 billion. Clearly, between robust customer growth, increasing customer usage in the commercial and industrial segments and the flourishing economic development activity in our service territories, the economy in the Southeast remains strong and extremely well positioned.\nTransitioning to our financing, I'd like to give an update on our activities for the quarter, including the progress made addressing our future equity needs. In the third quarter, we issued $4 billion of long-term debt across Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Southern Company Gas and Southern Power. The quality and credit strength of our subsidiaries continues to draw a robust investor interest. Strong demand for our subsidiary securities ultimately translates into lower interest costs, which will provide benefits to customers at our regulated subsidiaries over the long term. With these issuances, combined with what we issued in the first half of the year, we have fully satisfied our long-term debt financing needs for 2025 at each of our subsidiaries.\nOn the equity financing front, we continue to be opportunistic in our proactive approach and have made significant progress on our plans to source equity in a disciplined and credit-supportive manner. This approach reflects our steadfast commitment to credit quality, including our strong investment-grade credit ratings across all 3 major rating agencies. We plan to continue utilizing equity or equity equivalents in support of our path towards 17% FFO to debt within our planning horizon. Recall this long-term credit quality objective is intended to provide cushion to the quantitative credit metric targets provided by the rating agencies.\nAs a reminder, on our July earnings call, we highlighted a cumulative equity need of $9 billion through 2029 to fund our $76 billion capital investment plan in a credit supportive manner. Since our last earnings call, we priced an additional $1.8 billion of equity through forward sales agreements under our at-the-market or ATM program. These forward equity contracts contain final settlement dates that extend through mid-2027 with the ability to call sooner if we choose. This progress and flexibility it provides significantly reduces risk in our financing plans.\nWhen considering these ATM forward sales, other hybrid security issuances and past and projected issuances under our internal equity plans, we have solidified over $7 billion of our $9 billion equity need through 2029. We are extremely well positioned to address the remaining amounts in a shareholder-friendly manner.\nLooking ahead, and as we continue to take steps to require strong customer protections and credit provisions, our pipeline of large load data centers and manufacturers continues to be robust. Across our electric subsidiaries, the total pipeline remains more than 50 gigawatts of potential incremental load by mid-2030s. Recall that our disciplined approach to forecasting assumes that only a fraction of this load pipeline materializes. As Chris mentioned earlier, in just the last 2 months, we have 4 contracts across Southern Company system that represent over 2 gigawatts of load. As you can see, projects within our pipeline are maturing into executed contracts, which, along with their associated load ramps over the next several years, solidifies a substantial portion of our total forecasted electric sales growth of 8% annually through 2029, including average annual growth at Georgia Power of 12% through the same period.\nAcross Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, we now have contracts in place with large load customers, representing 7 gigawatts through 2029, which ultimately ramp to 8 gigawatts in the 2030s, and we are in advanced discussions for several more gigawatts of load.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Chris for further insights into the progress we are making on our plans.\n\nChristopher C. Womack\n\nExecutive VP & President of External Affairs, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, David. As David noted, we have made great progress with signing new large load contracts. Just last month, as a part of Georgia Power's ongoing RFP certification proceedings, Georgia Power filed an update to its load forecast. This update forecast continues to project the capacity need consistent with the 10 gigawatts of capacity resources being requested, which include 5 natural gas combined cycle units and 11 battery energy storage facilities. These proceedings are scheduled to have a final determination by the commission by the end of this year.\nSeparately, Alabama Power, following approvals from the Alabama Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has completed the acquisition of the 900-megawatt Lindsay Hill natural gas generating facility to serve projected long-term capacity needs in the state. In addition, construction continues on approximately 2.5 gigawatts of new generation in both Georgia and Alabama, which includes 3 natural gas combustion turbines and 7 battery storage facilities, all of which are projected to go online over the next 2 years.\nFurther, the South system for expansion at Southern Natural Gas within our Southern Company Gas subsidiary continues to move forward and will provide a valuable resource in serving the projected growth in our service territories. It is clear that we continue to make great progress executing on our plan as we deliver exceptional value to customers and investors.\nConsistent with our past practice, and representative of our continued discipline, we expect to provide a complete update to our long-term plan during our fourth quarter 2025 earnings call this coming February. As always, this update will include refreshes to our 5-year capital investment outlook, sales forecast and financing plans as well as our 2026 and long term EPS guidance. Consistent with our comments throughout 2025, as a part of that communication, we expect to provide additional clarity on our long-term earnings trajectory, which, as we've highlighted before, could translate into increasing the base from where our long-term EPS growth starts, which could be potentially as early as 2027.\nWe have delivered exceptional operational and solid financial results through the first 3 quarters of the year. Just this week, Southern Company was named to Newsweek's world's most trustworthy companies for 2025 list and was the highest ranked energy company in the United States on that list. Recognized companies were identified in an independent survey, and our inclusion at the top of this list is a testament to the hard work and unwavering commitment of our employees to uphold [indiscernible] and I an incredibly proud to finish the year strong. We have the team, we have the experience, and the scale to capture and execute on the exciting opportunities in front of us. We really have a bright and exciting future ahead.",

Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and David Poroch, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn addition, Dan Tucker, who recently announced his retirement as CFO of Southern Company after nearly three decades with the company, is also joining us for the call today. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and subsequent securities filings.

These results reflect the combined efforts of many employees across the Southern Company system who consistently work to deliver clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers. Our operations team, generation fleet, and power delivery system have demonstrated exceptional performance throughout the first half of the year.\nJust this week, during an extreme heat wave, our system, with the support of our dedicated team, met the year-to-date peak load of nearly 39GW with no major issues.\nOur success\n\nOperator\n\nis now being recorded\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nto our vertically integrated, state-regulated business model with long-range integrated resource planning processes, which continue to deliver substantial value to our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve. Providing outstanding reliability and affordable service to our customers is fundamental and just one example of why Southern Company truly is a great company and continues to find ways to improve and get better. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for an update on our financial performance.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the Q2 of 2025, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.92 per share, $0.07 above our estimate, and $0.18 lower than the Q2 of 2024.\nOur performance for the current quarter included increased earnings from investments in our state-regulated utilities, along with higher usage and customer growth, which added $0.06 year-over-year compared to Q2 2024. These positive drivers were offset by milder weather, prior-year gains on transmission asset sales, and current-year state tax credit adjustments, along with higher operating costs, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for Q3 is $1.50 per share.\nTurning now to our retail electricity sales, year-to-date weather-normal retail electricity sales were 1.3% higher than H1 2024. Year-over-year retail electricity sales growth increased modestly across all customer classes in Q2, growing 3% from Q2 2024.\nWeather-normal residential sales were up 2.8%, higher than in the Q2 of 2024, bolstered by the addition of over 15,000 new electric customers in the quarter and higher overall use per customer. Weather-adjusted commercial sales and industrial sales, which were 3.5% and 2.8% higher respectively in the quarter compared to the prior year, were driven by the combination of increased existing customer usage and new large-load customers coming online. Notably, data center usage was 13% higher compared to the Q2 of 2024.\nIndustrial sales to our largest customer segments also saw robust growth in the quarter, including transportation, primary metals, which were both up 6% year-over-year, and paper, which was up 16%. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris for further insights into our economic activity and to highlight recent constructive outcomes for some of our regulatory processes.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan.\nWhile we can continue to monitor macroeconomic trends, the economy in the Southeast remains well-positioned, with unemployment rates and recent population growth in our service territories better than national averages. Economic development activities in the Q2 continued, with announcements totaling nearly $2 billion of capital investment and more than 6,000 new jobs announced in our electric service territories. Of note, in Alabama, there were several economic development announcements led by continued expansion in the aerospace and automotive sectors.\nIndustrial manufacturing developments in Mississippi included the announcement of an expansion by a domestic manufacturer specializing in electric transformers, which is expected to create 400 local jobs. The large-load pipeline across Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, which includes data centers and large manufacturers, remains well above 50 GW of potential incremental load by the mid-2030s.\nWith project commitments totaling 10GW and ongoing advanced discussions for even more, interest from large-load customers in all of our electric service territories continues to be strong and growing, and we're increasingly well-positioned to serve this robust projected growth in a sustainable fashion. As we have consistently communicated, our disciplined approach includes pricing and contract terms designed to protect existing customers and our investments while also generating economic benefits for all customers.\nIn May, Georgia Power and the Georgia Public Service Commission Public Interest Advocacy staff, along with several other intervenors, reached a settlement that demonstrated the reality of these economic benefits for customers.\nThe stipulated agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, extends Georgia Power's 2022 alternate rate plan, ultimately precluding the need for a 2025 base rate case filing and keeping base rates stable and predictable over the next three years through 2028, with the exception of any future recovery of storm-related costs, including those related to Hurricane Helene. Overall, this outcome demonstrates our commitment to capturing the benefits of this robust projected economic growth and prioritizing customer affordability.\nWe believe this outcome, which preserves the existing regulatory framework in Georgia, benefits all stakeholders. Our vertically integrated market and constructive, orderly regulatory processes continue to help ensure we have the critical resources necessary to reliably and affordably serve our growing states.\nEarlier this month, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved a stipulated agreement between Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Public Interest Advocacy staff regarding Georgia Power's 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. This approval provided for continued investment in existing fleet, with plant life extensions at multiple steam units, uprates for more capacity at existing nuclear and natural gas facilities, and the modernization of hydro facilities to increase output and extend life.\nThe 2025 IRP outcome also further highlighted and confirmed the need for new generation resources previously approved in our prior IRPs as we build to serve projected growth. Under the approved IRP, Georgia Power received authorization to provide generation procurement options for at least six GW to meet increasing Georgia Power system demand.\nIn accordance with the IRP process, yesterday, Georgia Power filed to certify 8 GW of new generation resources resulting from the All Source Requests for Proposals, or RFPs. This competitive process, which was overseen by an independent evaluator, resulted in a mix of purchase power agreements, or PPAs, and multiple Georgia Power-owned resources being selected as the best choice for customers to meet the projected incremental capacity need by 2031. Of these, approximately 1.2 GW of the awards were for third-party PPAs, including 732 MW from existing Southern Power capacity.\nThe remaining 6.8 GW is a mix of Georgia Power-owned resources from a variety of technology types, including new combined cycle natural gas facilities, standalone battery energy storage systems, or BESS, and solar power BESS options.\nFurther, to meet the total capacity need identified as a part of Georgia Power's 2025 IRP load forecast, Georgia Power also requested certification for approximately two GW of additional generation capacity through a supplemental filing. This includes 1.6 GW from third-party PPAs, with the remainder consisting of Georgia Power-owned resources to address near-term projected generation needs. In summary, Georgia Power has filed a request to certify approximately 10 GW of new generation, which includes seven GW of Georgia Power-owned resources.\nThese requests will be reviewed by the Georgia PSC, with a final determination by the Commission expected later this year. I'll now turn the call over to David to share more about the capital investment and financing implications associated with these orderly regulatory processes.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone.\nEarlier this year, in addition to our $63 billion five-year base capital plan, we highlighted $10 to $15 billion of projected potential incremental regulated capital investment through 2029. With the approval of Georgia Power's 2025 IRP, along with the certification filings for new resources, we now have improved line of sight on our expected capital opportunities and are adding $12 billion of state-regulated capital into our five-year base capital plan.\nThis represents the capital investment associated with the low end of the 6 to 10GW range for new resources from the certification processes Chris mentioned earlier, along with investments associated with uprates and modernization of existing resources approved in the 2025 IRP. Should the Georgia PSC confirm the need for and ultimately certify the entire 10 GW of new generation, there could be up to an additional $4 billion of new state-regulated generation capital through 2029.\nSeparately, Southern Power, our competitive power business, has commenced repowering at three additional wind facilities in our existing portfolio, all of which have begun construction and are projected to be in service by the first half of 2027. These projects represent approximately $800 million of additional investment, which is now included in our base capital plan. In total, our five-year base capital plan has increased $13 billion from $63 billion to $76 billion, with potential upside of approximately $5 billion still pending, tied to the generation procurement certifications in Georgia and potential FERC-regulated gas pipeline expansions at Southern Company Gas.\nWe remain committed to funding our capital plan in a credit-supportive manner that supports our strong investment-grade credit ratings.\nAs we highlighted in our May earnings call, our financing activity through the Q1, along with our internal equity plans projected through 2029, resulted in a clear path to fully address the $4 billion equity needs in our original $63 billion base capital plan. The increase in our base capital plan of $13 billion is projected to be funded with approximately 40% of additional equity or equity equivalents, which represents an incremental $5 billion through 2029. This level of equity content supports our credit quality and our progress toward our credit metric target of approximately 17% FFO to debt in the latter part of our forecast horizon.\nIn fact, we've continued to be proactive in addressing our equity needs, pricing an additional $1.2 billion of equity through forward sales under our At the Market, or ATM, program since our last earnings call, leaving less than $4 billion of the incremental need remaining to be addressed through 2029. These remaining equity needs are easily manageable for a company our size. Considering just in the last six months, we've addressed well over $3 billion of equity and equity equivalents through our ATM program, internal equity plans, and issuances of junior subordinated notes.\nAs we've highlighted today, we continue to make great progress in solidifying our plan and remain increasingly encouraged about the strength of our long-term outlook and ultimately the potential to reassess the base for our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate as early as 2027. And I'll turn the call back over to you, Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, David. As you can see, we are building for growth in the Southeast, and our vertically integrated markets with constructive regulation and transparent orderly regulatory processes are proving foundational to meet this projected growth in a disciplined fashion that benefits the states in which we operate and the customers we are privileged to serve. This is an exciting time at Southern Company. We have accomplished a lot so far in 2025, and our future has never looked brighter.\nBefore we turn to questions, I'd like to highlight our commitment to investing in and developing our people at Southern Company. We are where we are thanks to our dedicated leadership team and our thousands of customer-focused, committed teammates across the enterprise.\nCollectively, they help each and every day to ensure we're making the right investments, running our business efficiently and effectively, and keeping customers at the center of everything we do. Sustained long-term success is a function of investing in our people and building a deeply talented bench. Our recently announced CFO transition, along with the other leadership announcements we've made in recent weeks, is a great example.\nWhile we have Dan around for a period of time advising and helping with the smooth transition, I am very pleased to have someone as experienced and talented as David stepping into the CFO role to continue with our mission to deliver regular, predictable, and sustainable results. I do want to congratulate Dan on an incredible career with Southern Company, and I want to thank him for everything he has done to support our company's success.\nFor three decades, his counsel, his strategic advice, his leadership, and his friendship have been foundational in helping our team seize the bright future ahead of us. One of the things I've always admired about Dan is his passion for developing our future leaders, and that's a legacy he'll certainly leave behind. I'm honored to call Dan my respected friend. And while his presence will be greatly missed, we wish he and Chelsea the very best as he embarks on a well-deserved retirement. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to be placed in the question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.\nOne moment, please, while we pull for questions. Our first question is coming from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nHey, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, Chris. Thanks so much for taking the time. Just maybe to start on the capital plan update and the shift in the rate-based growth to 8% from 7% through 2029, just any shifts potentially in the timeline as we think about the rebasing in 2027 or the views on the long-term growth rate there. And then just tactically, would you expect to give another full financial plan update on the Q4 call as well?\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSure. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for your question. Let me take the second question first. And yes, we will expect to continue with our normal cadence of doing annual updates, so we'll address all that in the Q4.\nAs it relates to the rate-based growth and the timing, we continue to be increasingly encouraged about what we're seeing in the marketplace. The momentum that we've seen with these large load customers is growing, and we're attracting many of them and having very good conversations about those. I think that we're going to stick to the plan of sustainability over the long term. We need to see how this plays out. We need to see it be in a sustainable pattern over the long term, and then we're going to be revisiting that set point within the 5% to 7%.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. And then just on the RFP update, some combined cycle capacity filed for certification there as part of the plan.\nCan you just refresh us on your procurement status in terms of turbines and also gas supply for those units to come into service in the 2029, 2030, 2031 timeframe?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Carly, we have reservations. We've paid the fees. And because of our size and activity that we've had for the past number of years, we have good relationships with the OEMs, also the EPCs in terms of how this work will be carried out. So we feel real good about where we are and making sure that we're positioning ourselves to be very efficient, but also making sure we have the ability to execute. Great. Appreciate that. And Dan, congratulations on your retirement, and thanks so much for all the insights over the last couple of years.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Thank you, Carly.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Steve Fleischman from Wolfe Research.\nYour line is now live.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nHey, Chris. Dan, man, you're leaving me one of the old ones here. But congrats, and David, congrats to you as well. So\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nthanks, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nA couple of questions. First, just maybe I think on a couple of the prior Q&A calls, you've talked about the kind of rebase in 2027, maybe toward the top end of the 5% to 7%, going back to, I don't know, 2025, and then kind of high end of 5% to 7% from there. Is that still what you're thinking, or has that shifted a little bit?\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, I think where we've come out on that, and I think we've been pretty consistent. Dan's been pretty consistent with that in the last several calls about rethinking that base upon which we set the 5% to 7% growth.\nAs I mentioned earlier, as we see that momentum growing and we get a better line of sight in a sustainable fashion, we'll recalibrate that and be within the 5% to 7% and work toward that. It could happen as early as 2027, but there's a lot of variables at play, and we like what we're seeing at the moment, but we really don't see that happening before 2027.\nYeah. Steve, we are where we were. I think, as David described earlier, we're gaining better line of sight on the things that we were looking for, but we are where we were.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Then on the FFO to debt improvement, could you maybe give us a sense of how kind of the year-by-year rough pace of getting to the 17%?\nWhere do you expect to be in 2025, 2026, and then when do you get to the 17?\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nWell, we expect to get to approximately the 17 near the back end of their planning horizon. With the capital that we see coming down the line, that path is going to be up and down a little bit. The pace and the shape of that may change over time, but we're going to continue to be very proactive and take advantage of opportunities as we see them as we grow into that 17% FFO to debt.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nDo you have a rough number where you are right now, at the end of the quarter, or?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Yeah. For the 12 months ended, Steve, and remember when we were talking about this before, we kind of gave a, \"Here's the unadjusted number.\nHere's the number adjusted for Helene.\" Right now, we're in the kind of 14.3, 14.4 unadjusted, more like 15.3 adjusted for the Helene. And I think what's important, and David hit this, is how proactive we're being with this equity plan. We hinted, as we talked about this before, that increased capital could kind of change the shape of the trajectory for this path to 17%, and I think that's what you'll see play out. But having the equity issued now, kind of if you adjusted for the equity we've committed to, that's another 70 basis points or so on today's numbers. So we feel good about the progress, the commitment, and how we're executing against that.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. One last question. Just how much are you maybe looking also at asset sales? And I think there have been some stories out about PowerSecure on that regard.\nCould you just talk to asset sales?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSteve, I know you wouldn't be disappointed if I said we're not going to comment on any rumors or anything specific. But as you know, we're always evaluating. I mean, if there's a better owner and they're willing to pay, we'll be a great seller in those circumstances. But I think it'd be very premature for us to comment and speculate on anything that you may have heard or maybe considered talked about in the marketplace today.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you. Congrats again.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Steve. Thank you, Chris. Always good to hear from you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hey, Julian.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, Chris. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Dan, David, truly congratulations to both of you. Wish you the best of luck there, Dan.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks very much.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAnd retirement.Absolutely. Guys, nicely done today, I got to say. Just a couple of details here. Can we talk firstly about load and the load update? I think you guys are going to refine that here later this year. Can we talk about what you're seeing? You guys have been very diligent in providing commentary about the pipeline. We certainly heard that from peers thus far with the earnings. How are you guys thinking, at least as it stands today, with respect to what you would anticipate, I think, in October?\nAnd then related, I suppose you've got this further affirmation from the PSC on a couple more GW, or I think that was the $4 billion number you guys threw out there as further potential in the commentary.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah.\nAnd on that number, I think we'll expect to hear from the commission later this year. I think by before the end of the year on that filing. As we've said, I mean, we still see that 50-gigawatt pipeline continuing to grow. And we continue to see just incredible amounts of activity. And as you see hyperscaler capital budgets continuing to grow, I mean, we just keep seeing these huge numbers. We see corresponding activity. And so we're in conversations with all of the majors, all the hyperscalers, and having what I would call very advanced discussions. And so we still got work to do. I mean, our focus is making sure we price them right, that there are benefits to existing customers.\nAnd so, but I would say very optimistic about what the future holds in these conversations and opportunities that we see available all across our electrics.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Okay. Fair enough. We shall see what happens this fall. And then maybe related here, as you think about that rate-based versus earnings translation here, any other factors that you could point to here, especially as you think about it? I heard your comments about repowering at Southern Power, but especially as you roll forward the plan here, any updated thoughts about where those contracts could land and/or maybe on the pipeline side? Any updates there as to opportunities in terms of size and scale? Again, I'm just thinking through the rate-based commentary here and subsequent implications to earnings, right? What are the other factors on the non-regulated stuff?\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSure. So the conversations that we're having with the large load customers are going well. Very interested in all of our service territories. A lot of attraction.\nObviously, we talked a lot about Georgia, but Alabama and Mississippi having great conversations there as well. So as we get more clarity to that, like I mentioned earlier, we're going to get to a place where we feel comfortable over the long term that that momentum is sustainable, and that's going to bring us to a place where we see the possibility of being able to reset that anchor point, if you will, within the 5% to 7%. Now, Julian, you also asked about Southern Power and some of those repowering projects that we've got going on there.\nThat is just a great company. And we've got a lot of opportunities that we're thinking about in the marketplace with all that's going on with the large load customers. But as we see them, we evaluate them.\nKeep in mind, as we've talked about probably for years, that we do not get a hold of or get in front of ourselves. We don't put placeholders in our capital plan. Whatever projects that we find that we want to go explore, they're going to have to meet some pretty strict, stringent risk-return parameters that we follow and have historically followed. But one interesting thing to think about is you look into the next decade as we get into the early 2030s, there's several contracts that will come up for renewal at Southern Power. And what we see in the marketplace, there should be we expect the possibility of some really good opportunities to reprice a lot of that capacity in the early part of the next decade.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nRight. So maybe more ripe by the time you get to '27 with that longer-term roll forward than the rebase.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThat's right. That's kind of the plan that we've been set on for a while. Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. I'll leave it there, guys. All the best. Speak soon.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Nick.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for all the updates. Congrats to Dan on your retirement, and congrats to David. Looking forward to work with you. So hey, I just had a follow-up actually on Southern Power. I was just wondering, now that you're kind of committing more capital there, just how would you frame the returns compared to your core regulated business? And then I know it's just a much smaller part of the business, but just in a post-OBB world, how are you kind of framing the returns for contracted renewables?Thank you.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSure. Yeah.\nGreat to hear from you. We've talked about we have a pretty stringent risk-return parameter. We try to set these things up with long-term creditworthy counterparties, try not to take fuel risk. And that usually plays out for us to be a little bit higher than our state-regulated returns historically. And we see these opportunities giving rise to perhaps expanding that in the future. But like I said, there's a thin needle to get through when we work through these things. The risk-reward has to be right, and the credit metrics have to be right for the counterparty. But we do explore opportunities all the time there.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. No, thank you. And I guess in the IRP, there were nuclear uprates contemplated here. Just wondering where the conversation now kind of stands on new nuclear overall.\nHave those discussions picked up with the recent momentum we've seen in the industry and the executive orders? Just, I guess we've talked about this before, but where do you guys kind of stand now in your position on that? Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Nick, we've been very clear about the need for new nuclear in this country. And so talk with the administration, talk with hyperscalers all across this country. We speak the virtues of the importance of new nuclear as with the success that we had with Vogtle 3 and 4 in terms of bringing those two units online. I mean, I still think we've got to complete the risk mitigation, the financial concerns that are there on the back end. We've got to make sure there's financial certainty as those projects are pursued. And so we continue to have those kind of conversations amongst ourselves, but throughout the industry.\nBut we continue to believe that for this country to respond to the incredible demand we see, new nuclear has got to be a part of the solution set going forward. And we'll continue to talk about it and continue to advance ideas to try to make it happen and to get it done.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nOkay. Great. And just one last one, if I could follow up on Julian's question, but you still expect a large load update filing in August, and that would be higher than kind of the 52 that we talked about in the past?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\n. Yeah. I mean, we will give updates, and as we seek success and as we see these projects advance, we'll make sure that we have updates. We'll continue to keep you abreast of where we are and what's occurring, and also letting you know what we see in the marketplace.\nWe think the intelligence and market analysis about what's occurring as this market continues to advance, we'll continue to share.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Growing in the pipeline, Nick, but just remember, our disciplined approach is going to risk-adjust that, and that's what you'll see us planning for and working with the commission on.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And just to clarify, we'll make that filing in the mid-August timeframe with the Georgia Public Service Commission, and then we'll follow on in September through the RFP and the certification process that will provide an updated load forecast that will reflect what we see in the marketplace as well.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. That's great. Always interesting to see those filings, so thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Your line is now live. Hey, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHi, everybody. Congrats to everyone echoing that sentiment.\nFirst question is on the gas plants. I see you're planning to build some new units by 2029 or 2030, but you're also planning to add combined cycle plants under PPA as early as 2028. How confident are you in those counterparties' ability to execute on timing? It seems a little aggressive from an EPC and turbine delivery perspective. What assurances or protections do you have in place?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. That's existing capacity, Andrew. So those are just that's available capacity in the marketplace that's rolling off of a PPA that's serving some either already serving Georgia Power and expiring or serving someone else.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nPerfect. Okay. Great. And then the other question is, obviously, three years ago, you had an IRP, and then demand was so robust, you needed to do the 2023 update.\nNow that the 2025 process is complete, how are you feeling about the outlook for demand, and it's sticking for at least the next three years? Obviously, it's a moving target. I think you said you'll share a refreshed load growth target with us in six months. Maybe just high-level thoughts on how much buffer, or excess reserve margin, or just how are you thinking about it now that this year's process was settled?\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSure. Yeah. Great question. I mean, if you look at the result of the 2025 IRP approval, we've got an incremental generation need that was acknowledged and agreed to in the stipulation, and approved by the Public Service Commission. And then we're going to be in this pattern of repeatedly updating what our large load pipeline looks like that will, at least in September, but perhaps more often, come with updates of our load forecast.\nWe've got this structure that is going to exist at the Georgia Public Service Commission that is orderly, is thoughtful. There's good deliberation of what is submitted, but it also has a degree of flexibility to it as well. So we filed the 2025 IRP, but we are not at all precluded, if circumstances warrant, from doing an update to that as well.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Sounds good. Nicely done, turning what was supposed to be a very noisy year into a pretty smooth one so far. Thank you very much.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you. Thanks, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nHi. Good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGood. Thanks. Congrats, Dan and David, as well. Dan, we will miss you. First, want to start with Alabama, Mississippi a little bit here. You touched on the economic momentum there.\nAnd I was just wondering if you could speak to when these tailwinds could possibly translate into incremental investment opportunities there.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI think it's going to be very difficult to speak exactly when all that exactly shows up. I can just say to you that we're in the midst of advanced discussions on a number of projects. And so, I mean, there's work being done there. And so as it advances, we'll advise you and let you know. But good conversations, good activity, good, strong pipeline. I mean, we've talked about some of the economic projects, the Airbus and some others that have announced economic development expansions. I think we've spoken to some of those, but there's just a good, strong, solid pipeline of activity that's occurring there that I think is moving to some advanced discussions.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And some of that investment that you're asking about is already occurring.\nCertainly, I think we spoke in a prior quarter about over 1,000MW of data center projects across those two states. There's the transmission and distribution investments that are already happening there. You've seen Alabama Power acquire and have other pending acquisitions on generation resources to serve their growing load. So it's happening. It's a little it's been a little less front and center than all this stuff happening in Georgia lately.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. And then just want to pivot to the FERC gas pipeline expansion potential there. Just wondering what visibility you have there. What are the gating items left?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSo as a reminder, so this is largely our investments with Kinder Morgan. We have another investment that we co-own in North Georgia. And as you can imagine, they are tied to a lot of the same things driving our utility investment.\nSo it's around new combined cycle construction. It's around large load growth and just load growth overall in the area. It's not just our utilities. It's the co-ops. It's the munis being served as well. And so the upside potential is really a function of what will be built where ultimately to serve this large load.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGot it. Understood. Thank you for that. And then just the last one, if I could, as always, the equity needs there. Just wondering, thoughts on using forwards to kind of de-risk the outlook there.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nWell, it's really not appropriate to talk about specific structures or timing, but we've got a lot of flexibility. We've demonstrated that there's multiple tools, if you will, in the toolbox that we can implement.\nAnd I think we're going to continue on that path and be proactive and take advantage of opportunities whenever they present themselves to achieve the equity needs that we have over the horizon. And to your point, I think technically it may be worth pointing out that our ATM program, it really is a forward. I mean, we're locking in a price, if you will, today for securities that we're transacting that will be delivered in the future. So to your point, I think we are utilizing that flexibility.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGot it. Makes sense. Thank you. I'll leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Bill Appicelli from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks, Dan, for all the great work over the years. You'll be missed. Just to clarify on a question that Steve asked earlier around the financial guidance.\nSo the outlook is to see where you shake out in the current 5% to 7% through 2027, right, and then rebase the 5% to 7% off of that number. That's the intention.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I wouldn't necessarily put a specific date on the calendar for that. I mean, it could be as early as 2027, but like I said, there's a long list of things that need to come to fruition. We need to see the continuing momentum solidify and be sustainable over the long period. So that could be 2027 when we rebase the set point within the 5% to 7% targets. But we're not going to get ahead of ourselves there. We've got to wait to see how these things that we see on the horizon come to fruition.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nOkay. Understood. And then just a question higher level around the trends on generation costs, right?\nSo we've seen the cost of combined cycles and peakers obviously materially escalate over the last couple of years. I mean, in the conversations and in your own financial planning for some of this generation future needs, I mean, what are you baking in? Is the expectation that these costs are going to continue to increase materially, or is there some, as capacity comes on from some of the developers, manufacturers, is it going to stabilize? I mean, what is your view in terms of how you plan for that?\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I mean, you're kind of seeing the same things that we're seeing out there in the marketplace. You're absolutely right that prices are going up, but we've got placeholders and reservation fees in there, and we're going to react accordingly and be prepared to be able to deliver the capacity that we need in the timelines that we've committed.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nBut as you know, man, there's a lot of demand out there. And so there's a lot of upward pressure that we see in the marketplace.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nOkay. All right. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHi, Anthony.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nHey, good afternoon, everyone. Congrats, Dave, Dan. Congrats. Really appreciate all the time you gave us over the years. I just have one follow-up. I think it's been the thematic for the whole call, the questions. I'm just trying to balance out the conservative approach of management versus maybe the uncertainty that you guys maybe think about achieving a higher growth rate.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nYou have such firepower, CapEx, and a big raise today, but hey, maybe not until 2027 at the earliest and still not looking to anchor that in. I'm just curious if you could help us balance that out when we clearly understand you guys have always approached it conservative.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nWell, I think you hit it right there. You obviously do know us, and I appreciate that. You're absolutely right. We're going to take this in a conservative manner. We're seeing the growth accelerating, having great conversations with a lot of potential large load customers, and we see a lot of this coming to fruition in the back half of the decade. So we've got to see how this plays out. Also, keep in mind, we are a fairly big company, and it takes a lot to move us.\nAnd so we need to see that momentum get to a place where it can carry us in a sustained way where it makes sense for us to change that long-term outlook.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Chris, I always thought of you as the Paul Simon, and Dan as the Art Garfunkel, so no worries going forward.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Anthony, but we're still singing. We're still performing.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThe band is still together.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global Securities . Angie, please go ahead.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Angie.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nThank you. How are you? So I'm just wondering, I mean, you clearly have this unique cost of capital advantage in the entire industry. That usually comes with, well, with more pressure, but also premium growth prospects. You are sticking with your current range, again, for the time being.\nBut the other ways to create upside to earnings, asset acquisition, corporate acquisitions, I mean, you clearly have experience in developing generation assets. Some of your peers are starting to do what basically Southern Power has done in the past, so either expanding existing assets or building greenfield gas plants, again, using your skills. So you're not going into any of this. Is it just because you are not planning to do it, or is it just because you don't want to sort of project the options that lie ahead?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nWell, first, Angie, I think we should get you to come tell our story for us sometimes too. That's terrific. But look, it's just our nature, and it kind of goes back to what Anthony said. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. We do have tremendous opportunities here.\nYes, Southern Power remains an opportunity not only to recontract the existing fleet, but to potentially build new green or brownfield sites as all this growth is happening. But as part of our discipline and our outlook, because we are a regulated utility holding company, we don't put placeholders in there for Southern Power. We're not a development company, even though we are incredibly skilled at it. It's just how we have approached this historically. It's how we're trying to approach this going forward. And I think David described it incredibly well. This is about us having the discipline to assess whether or not what we see is sustainable for the truly long term and not temporary in nature, which we don't believe it is, but we want to be sure.\nAnd as we are, you'll see us kind of acknowledge the incredible upside that we think exists in our outlook.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nOkay. And then just the other thing is, so we heard from some other vertically integrated electric utilities, right? They can name specific projects that are coming to their service territory, and those announcements are being made along with those utilities. In your case, I'm not complaining that there hasn't been enough activity on the data center side in Georgia or Mississippi, but fewer of those are sort of done along with your state utilities. Is it just a different business model, or is it just a different pitch?\nAgain, it almost feels like it almost seems like those other utilities are getting more traction because they are being more, they're linking some of the generation assets to those projects directly while you are just, I guess, increasing the load for the entire system. I don't know if I'm expressing myself correctly. It seems like your announcements are less glitzy than those from others.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo, you're not being, I mean, we get exactly what you're saying. And I think we're not promotional, and I think we're not getting ahead of ourselves until the deals are done. And we're not talking about any non-binding conversation, not any non-binding agreements. I mean, we're working diligently through the processes, and at the right time, we will make the appropriate announcements.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I think the biggest affirmation for us, Angie, is these processes we're going through with our regulators.\nThey see what we see, and they are agreeing with the needs that we see to serve this growing dynamic. Whether there's promotional announcements around individual customers or not, we're getting independent affirmation that this stuff is there and that there are benefits for existing customers, and it will support the kind of investment that you're seeing us make.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And just to add on to that, that last point about the benefits to customers, you got to keep in mind these are incredibly complex contracts, very large volumes that we're working through. And the paradigm that we've tried to establish in our service territories is entering into these contracts that will also provide benefits for all of our existing customers and protect those same customers. And so that takes a minute to get through those conversations and get to a good answer for everybody.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nThere we go. Congrats, everybody.\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Angie.\n\nDavid Poroch\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Angie.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments. Again, let me thank everyone for being a part of our call today.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you for your questions, and we value and appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Thank you very much, and have a good rest of the day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Q2 2025 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported adjusted earnings results for Q1 above our estimate, with year-over-year growth reflected across all our major businesses. The Southeast has a track record of economic resilience, and we continue to be encouraged by robust economic development activity that includes a sizable large load pipeline.\nOur state-regulated electric utilities continue to experience customer growth, and the service territories that we are privileged to serve remain attractive to a wide variety of commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, the reliability and the resilience of our vertically integrated and well-planned grid are proving hard to beat, and customers, especially data center customers, are increasingly acknowledging that reality with their enthusiasm for our electric service territories.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dan, we know there is a great deal of interest in tariffs and any potential implications to our business. There's clearly policy uncertainty, and in turn, our assessments of tariff implications have varied. For our base capital plan, we currently estimate a range of 1% to 3% of potential cost increases, with the top of the range representing the higher end of tariffs that existed for only a few days last month.\nAmong the advantages for a company of our scale is a large portfolio of suppliers and strong vendor relationships to help navigate such challenges collaboratively and proactively. For example, while the majority of materials being sourced from Mexico and Canada qualify for zero tariffs because they comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the company is working proactively to get any remaining vendors or purchases compliant as well.\nOur full complement of potential mitigations includes existing project contingencies, contractual provisions, potential regulatory approaches, and options to deploy alternative resources. Our commitment to affordability, balanced with our focus on reliability, could also influence the pace of our capital deployment to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers. Overall, we do not expect a material impact to our forecast.\nOur financial outlook remains strong, and we remain focused on disciplined execution. The orderly processes and constructive regulatory frameworks in our service territories, combined with our experienced team and our customer-centric business model, should serve us well as we prioritize reliable and affordable energy for our nine million-plus customers. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the Q1 of 2025, our adjusted EPS was $1.23 per share, $0.20 higher than the Q1 of 2024, and $0.03 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were investments in our state-regulated utilities and weather-related impacts, which added $0.08 year-over-year due to a milder-than-normal Q1 in 2024 and a slightly colder-than-normal Q1 for 2025. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, depreciation, and amortization. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the Q2 is $0.85 per share. Overall, weather-normal retail electricity sales to all classes were 0.3% lower than the Q1 of 2024.\nThe lower sales for the quarter were driven largely by usage impacts on our residential customer class, which was partially offset by customer additions. These use-per-customer trends in the Q1 were consistent with our sales forecast for the year, including the approximately 1% year-over-year negative impact of having an extra day in the Q1 of 2024, which affected all customer segments year-over-year.\nWe also believe return-to-office trends and customers' proactive management of their energy consumption in response to inflation and economic uncertainty continue to be factors as well. Commercial and industrial sales were higher compared to the Q1 of 2024, as we saw continued strength in data center sales, which were up 11% year-over-year, office buildings, which were up 4%, and the transportation sector, which increased 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the Hyundai Metaplant in Southeast Georgia beginning production activities several months ago.\nMore broadly, the economy in the Southeast remains well-positioned, with unemployment rates and recent population growth in our service territories better than the national averages. Additionally, economic development activity in Q1 was robust, with announcements totaling over $11 billion of capital investment and more than 4,000 new jobs announced in our electric service territories.\nAs we look ahead, our large load pipeline across our electric subsidiaries, which includes data centers and large manufacturers, continues to grow, totaling more than 50GW of potential incremental load by the mid-2030s. With project commitments totaling 10GW and ongoing advanced discussions for even more, interest from large load customers in our service territories continues to be robust. As we've consistently communicated, our disciplined approach to forecasting means that our sales forecast only assumes a fraction of this pipeline materializes.\nGeorgia Power's ongoing 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, filed earlier this year, includes continued investment in the existing fleet, with proposed plant life extensions, uprates for more capacity at existing nuclear and natural gas facilities, and the modernization of hydro facilities as we continue to plan our resources to economically and reliably serve our customers for the long term. Resolution of the 2025 IRP is expected in mid-July.\nAlso in Georgia, the regulatory process continues for 13GW of new energy resources via competitive requests for proposals, or RFPs. Various company-owned resources were submitted into these valuations. Successful bidders are expected to be notified in the coming months for a substantial portion of these RFPs, including 8.5GW of all-source, or technology-agnostic, energy resources. Georgia Power expects to file for certification of all projects awarded under these RFPs with the Georgia Public Service Commission in July.\nConsidering the timeline of these ongoing Georgia regulatory processes, we expect to be positioned to provide additional color on potential updates to our capital expenditure outlook and associated financing plan on our Q2 earnings call. All else being equal, this potential incremental capital and continued economic development momentum are key to supporting our potential reevaluation of the base for our long-term EPS growth as early as 2027.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Chris, I'd like to provide an update on our financing activities through the Q1. Our state-regulated electric subsidiaries have issued $2.2 billion of long-term debt year-to-date, which is nearly 1/2 of 2025's projected financing needs for those entities in our base plan. Quality and credit strength of our subsidiaries continue to draw robust investor interest, providing strong access to capital and supporting lower interest costs for the benefit of customers.\nAt the parent company, we have issued approximately $2.4 billion of junior subordinated notes, or JSNs, year-to-date, which receive 50% equity treatment from the rating agencies. We have also entered into forward contracts through our at-the-market program, or ATM, for the sale of an additional $1 billion of common stock, with settlements extending as late as the second half of 2026. Collectively, the ATM and the JSNs equate to $2.2 billion of equity and equity equivalents.\nCombined with approximately $350 million of annual equity issuances we forecast through our internal plans, we have a clear path in place to fully address the $4 billion five-year equity needs in our base plan. Our disciplined approach in sourcing equity reinforces our commitment to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings and our journey to 17% FFO to debt, while also focused on delivering value to shareholders.\nWe are well-positioned to continue to finance any incremental growth opportunities above our base plan in a credit-supportive and shareholder-focused fashion. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Last week, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our annual common dividend, raising the annualized rate to $2.96 per share. This action marks our 24th consecutive annual increase, and this will now be 78 consecutive years dating back to 1948. Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year. We are incredibly proud of our dividend track record, which continues to be an integral part of Southern Company's long-term value proposition.\nSouthern Company has consistently delivered regular, predictable, and sustainable adjusted results, and our start to this year provides a solid foundation to continue executing on our goals for 2025 and beyond. We remain very excited about the future of this company. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nDoing well. Thanks. Thanks for taking the time. Maybe just to start, on the Q2 EPS guide, the $0.85 represents fairly sizable downside relative to what you guys did last Q2 in 2024. Could you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes there that drive that estimate, particularly relative to the stronger Q1 print?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, absolutely, Carly. This is Dan. Thanks for the question. So there's two big factors in there, really. One is weather. Year-over-year, there's a pretty substantial weather differential. If you're thinking about what normal weather in our forecast relative to a really strong, kind of warmer-than-normal quarter a year ago. And then the other one is really just what I'd characterize as timing. There are kind of recurring normal-course transactions that happen within the Georgia transmission system that is mutually owned amongst all the parties in the state, not solely Georgia Power, the municipal entity that represents the co-ops. And there are ongoing transactions to transfer ownerships of assets kind of commensurate with their load. So we had a sizable transaction that occurred in the Q2 of last year, and there's none anticipated similarly in the Q2 of this year. So those are the two big drivers.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Great. That's helpful. Thanks for the clarity on that piece. And then maybe just on the Georgia Power load pipeline, just any update you can provide in terms of size of the pipeline, what's contracted, what's broken ground, similar to the disclosures that you guys have provided in prior quarters. And then just more broadly, anything you could share on conversations you're having with your data center customers in Georgia and if there's been any change in tone, just given the macro environment relative to last quarter?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nChris, why don't you start with any change in tone, and I'll hit the numbers.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Carly, I mean, I think what we've seen is that we've not seen a shift in tone. I mean, I think as you've seen a few hyperscalers make some announcements the past couple of days about capital budgets, I think that's what we have seen in terms of our conversations all across our service territory with these data center hyperscaler customers in terms of looking to continue to make those investments to support their business strategies now and into the future. So we still see a robust degree of high economic activity in our service territory.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And then when it comes to the pipeline itself, Carly, you asked about the Georgia pipeline. I mean, in total, again, going out to the mid-2030s, it's about 52GW in Georgia alone. The contracted piece is 4GW for that same number. The committed is 8GW. I think the more interesting thing that you'll see when Georgia Power makes its filing here in the coming weeks is actually a shift forward in interest. So the more near-term pipeline, the 2028, 2029 kind of number is actually moving up, which is actually an interesting and also exciting thing to see happening in the pipeline.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nAwesome. Thanks so much for that. Appreciate it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies LLC.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Julian. How are you doing?\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the time. I appreciate it. Nicely done again. Got to hand it to you.\nHey, so let me just follow up a little bit where Carly just left it off there, because I know in the quarter there's been a lot of talk about Microsoft and others that you're dealing with directly in your service territory, and there's a perception you just hit it. But are you seeing any churn in the underlying composition of who, and the kind of data centers, and the geography that you're seeing? Again, I know folks at times are super fixated on one or two out there, but listening to your comments here, I mean, even if you got fixated on one specific site, it seems like you're still seeing an aggregate acceleration in the opportunity. But I'd love to hear you reconciling your comments against some of the concerns about one or two discrete data points here.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd, Julian, I think you said it very well. I mean, there's an, I guess, aggregate, I use the word diversity of customers, I mean, from the one or two or three or four hyperscalers to developers as well. I mean, so I think we see kind of a wide, diverse nature of interest that is showing up in our territory, and that momentum continues to exist. I mean, so it's not just one or two. I think what we see is across the board in terms of the conversation and the interest that we are seeing.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. Yeah, I appreciate the commentary as possible here. And you guys provided some nice details on equity and overall financing plan here. Can you elaborate a little bit as you think about marrying up an improving balance sheet with your comments about the rebates potentially in 2027? When and how do you think about getting to that 17% and reconciling that against the potential rebates? Do you think you'd be at that 17% by the time you kind of reevaluate, shall we say, your EPS commitments here?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nI think of it more as having line of sight on it, and I think we've said this before. So, everything in kind of a measured way, and financing all of our capital with the right mix to kind of get there.\nThe biggest, as we've highlighted before, the biggest driver of improvement in the short term is really debt associated with certain regulatory assets rolling off. Right now, on the books, there's about $2 billion really just to Georgia Power alone between the remaining under-recovered fuel from a few years ago. There's about $1 billion of that. And then a little over $800 million of storm costs from Hurricane Helene. As those costs get recovered over the next few years, that naturally, on its own, kind of brings the number up. The other offsetting factor will be, and I think this was a bit implicit in your question, is the capital plan, and particularly if we have incremental opportunities to deploy capital. That could adjust the shape of our journey to 17% a little bit and perhaps push it out a year or two.\nBut I think getting to the heart of your question, by the time we get to 2027 or whenever that time comes, will we be there? No, but will we need to have confidence that we can see it in the foreseeable future? Absolutely. And I think that's how we'll be positioned.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Thank you for understanding the gist of it. Appreciate it, Dan. Best of luck, Chris. Nicely done.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Julian. Always, man.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector of Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. Good afternoon.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Nick.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector of Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank, Barclays\n\nHey. So, question on the rebates, just trying to kind of understand a little bit more what that would look like. And I guess the question is, do you anticipate kind of being at the higher end of your five to seven through 2027? And that would kind of equate to a new higher base for 2027 to grow off of. Is it just going to be based off of actuals and where you get to? I guess I'll leave it there, but just looking for more color on the interim.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSure, Nick. And yeah, and what I'll do is I'll just kind of restate the way we said it on our last call because, again, nothing has changed in the 10 weeks since then in terms of how we think about this. It's to the extent that this incremental capital opportunity that we pointed to emerges, and to the extent that this data center, in particular, momentum continues; all else being equal, yes, we believe that in the back half of our plan, we could be positioned at or near the top of our existing range. Now, we also pointed to headwinds in the near term, like parent company interest refinancings, and that's why the immediate near term is not up there. This is really about the back 1/2.\nIf that is what we see and where we are, and if, kind of like going back to Julian's question about having line of sight, if that appears to be a sustainable trajectory, then that provides us the opportunity to potentially rebase the starting point for 5% to 7% growth.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector of Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank, Barclays\n\nOkay. No, that's helpful. And then, just Georgia Power rate case, just wanted to make sure, are you guys still on track to kind of file that at the end of June or by July 1st? And has anything kind of changed there in your rate case strategy? Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNick, I think you said it very well. As required by the 2022 rate case order, we're working towards the filing this summer. So it'd be that early July timeframe. So everything is on track to do that and to make sure we comply with that order. But you said it very well.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector of Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood. Good. Thanks. Maybe just kind of picking up on the last point there with regards to the Georgia Power rate case. Maybe build pressures and focus, I guess, nationwide. And just wondering any thoughts you could share there with levers that you could potentially pull to manage customer bills there. Is the potential to kind of move timing around rate changes to coincide with fuel cost recovery rolling off or just any other thoughts there?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd once again, I mean, I think you're acknowledging all the factors, the variables, and the puts and takes that will be under consideration as we look at the filing. I mean, it's a little bit too early to say what the exact filing will look like. But yeah, I mean, one of the things we think about is the pricing of these large load growth, how that can impact and help us with our focus on affordability. Yes, I mean, we do have the fuel case, fuel adjustment occurring that we're looking to recognize next year, in June of next year. So that's a factor to also be considered. We also have storm recovery related to Hurricane Helene that has to be dealt with.\nSo, I mean, I think you've acknowledged a lot of the factors that will go into what this filing could look like, but it's just way too early to kind of speak to exactly what the nature of the filing, how it will come together.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. No, that's helpful. Thank you. Then just curious on your outlook for the IRA and any potential changes there, how that could impact Southern, particularly as it relates to transferability, I guess, as in focus for the market. Just any thoughts in general from what you see or what you guys are thinking at this point?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Jeremy, I'll hit transferability first and let Chris weigh in on any kind of broader policy commentary. But on transferability, we just aren't that reliant on it. We certainly take advantage of it where we can, and we've got a great program in place to monetize tax credits as efficiently and quickly as possible. But if for some reason that was not available to us based on our current base plan, I mean, the impact FFO to debt, let's say, is a basis point or two, or I'm sorry, 10 to 20 basis points or so. And so it's just not that meaningful, but it's important. And when it comes to projects that we're doing in the regulated space, it's good for customers to have that in place. It helps obviously monetize things and keep the balance sheet efficient, and that's good for everybody.\nSo we're certainly doing what we can to be a part of that conversation and to express the importance, Chris?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo, I mean, as Dan talked to me, as a part of that conversation that Dan referred to, I mean, we continue to engage with policymakers in the administration, but also as well as on Capitol Hill, expressing and explaining the value and the benefits of these credits and tax policy in terms of value goes directly to customers. As we talk about affordability and our strategy there, making sure there's full recognition or understanding that the benefits of these credits go directly to our customers. So we are, I mean, we have no idea politically how this is going to play out with all the issues that are going on in Washington, but we continue to spend a lot of time making sure we're telling the story and helping people understand the value and benefits of these tax provisions.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Weisel, Scotiabank.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good afternoon, everybody. I'm hoping to elaborate a little bit on the commentary on demand trends. Even after adjusting for the leap day, each customer class saw a sequential slowdown. Data centers, in particular, still grew at a double-digit pace, but down from 17% last quarter to 11%. Can you talk about that a little bit? I realize the year-ago weather was atypical, certainly skewed the residential comps, but that shouldn't matter as much for C&I. Can you elaborate a little bit?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I don't think there's anything to read into it, Jeremy. Again, if you adjust commercial and industrial in particular for that leap day effect just for the Q1, again, these are just quarter numbers, not kind of 12-months ended numbers. It's almost a full 1%, so up 1.5% or so. The underlying stuff, like you mentioned, data centers, look, you're doing growth year-over-year on an increasing ramp, right? And so you're not comparing to the same numbers you were a quarter ago. You're comparing off a higher base a year ago. And so the numbers aren't going to necessarily align or continue to escalate in that fashion. In total volume, they continue to go up. Other things relative to our forecast, look, there's things that are just, again, timing-related. There were some large industrial outages, not economy-related, just kind of operational-related.\nThere was a delay in a steel manufacturer that was expected to come on the Q1 that is baked into our numbers for the full year. That's expected now in the next several months. And so from our seat, nothing in the Q1 results gives us any pause about any kind of systemic trends we're seeing in the economy or underlying customer base.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. That's good to hear. And then similarly, the large load pipeline, the slides say well over 50. Dan, did I hear you right? Did you say 52GW now? I'm not sure if I maybe misheard you, but maybe if you could just get a little more detail there. How are you? You're being very clear in the tone that activity remains robust. Maybe you could get a little more detail in the numbers.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And I think the tone, Andrew, is what's more important than numbers. I answered a question earlier specific to the Georgia pipeline that we make filings on. So that's 52GWon its own. The characterization we made in the prepared remarks is for the total consolidated pipeline across all three electric service territories. And we said over 50. And it grew quarter- over-quarter. In fact, it was over 50 last quarter. It's over 50 this quarter, but it's a bigger over 50. We're trying to be a little less precise about the total because, look, everyone has acknowledged that these pipelines include some degree of double counting. They include some degree of speculative projects.\nThat's where it's really important to really focus on the way, in a very measured way, that we are only including and counting on and planning for a small fraction of these numbers. So we're trying not to get hung up too much on the big headline number and focus more on kind of the underlying tangible trends that we're seeing within that pipeline.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. As long as you're clarifying that they are in fact rising, that's reassuring. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\n[ Crosstalk] You bet, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nUtilities, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey. Thanks so much. I guess maybe on data center activity, I was just wondering if there had been any changes following the modifications of the rate structure that you've now implemented in Georgia. Any feedback on that? Is that manageable for the industry to work with now in that state?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, David, it's Dan. It's early days still. So it's important to understand kind of the journey we've been on there. So much earlier this year, we highlighted the rules which the commission approved, which were very kind of high-level rules to be the basis of a framework. What has happened since then is there's been an actual more detailed framework that's been developed by the public utility staff working with the company to kind of create what is essentially a TERA framework. It doesn't have specific pricing in there, but it is a framework for doing this. That just got finalized a couple of weeks ago. 15 April , I think, was the date that it happened. So in terms of the details kind of being absorbed by and understood well by potential customers, that process is underway now. So it's a little early for reaction.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nBut I do think some of the reaction we've gotten, some feedback we've gotten, we talk a lot about orderly processes. This framework does provide another degree of order and certainty as we engage with these customers. And I think you've seen another state and others consider looking at deploying, approving very similar rules and regulations. So we think to somewhat of a market that's evolving to bring this kind of certainty really brings some discipline and puts us in a position, as we always say, to make sure as we engage with these customers, we want to provide benefits to all of our customers. So we think there's great value in these rules and regulations and this framework that's been approved by the commission.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And David, as you heard me answer Andrew's question, I mean, over the last three months, the pipeline has grown. And the nature of these rules, while the details have not been out there, the nature of them has been for three months, and that growth has continued to occur.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nUtilities, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep. Yep. Got it. Okay. Great. That makes sense. Separately, I was curious: is there any feedback that you'd offer on what you're seeing in the RFPs that are underway? There have just been so many moving pieces around, like tariffs, inflation, price increases for equipment. So I'm just wondering, are there any changes in the preference, like technology preference or strategy, or the split among solar storage, natural gas as you're kind of executing against these RFPs?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And David, unfortunately, we can't speak to the RFP process. It's very intentionally done kind of by an independent evaluator, very confidentially, a lot of trade secret information. So disclosing or answering any of the questions you just asked, I think, would be stepping outside the bounds of what we were allowed to do.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nUtilities, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Got it. We'll revisit as you get toward the end there. But appreciate it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I will just say, David, look, what's important about the RFP itself being the nature is it's all source, right? So it does inherently have in it a multitude of technologies and options. At the end of the day, given all the factors you've listed, that independent evaluator and the commission will have options to kind of address.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nUtilities, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Understood. Okay. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nDurgesh, how you doing, man?\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities, Evercore ISI\n\nHey. Good afternoon. You actually answered all my questions, but can I just ask a quick clarification question on the RFP? So I think there's some language in the slides on clarity by July. This is the Georgia RFP. But then there's some also, I think, language in the release that you'll get more incremental data points throughout 2025. And then, Dan, I think you said Q2 call, which is presumably sometime in July, we'll be able to get some more CapEx details. So are we going to get concrete data points from the RFP in July itself?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nSo definitely, Durgesh, by the time of our Q2 call, we will be able to speak to, we believe, incremental capital opportunities at least associated with that largest all-source RFP and maybe some degree of the other RFPs. And so that will kind of address most, I think, of the potential upside capital that we've pointed to.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Got it. Okay. Perfect. That's all I had. I'll give the time to somebody else. Really appreciate you taking the time.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nThat, Durgesh.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nShah\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHey. Good afternoon, everyone. It's actually Alex here on for Shah.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Alex.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nJust on the impacts from tariffs, as we think about the growth opportunities at Southern Power, sort of, what's the exposure there? You could be looking at building contracted gas. And conversely, does the tariff and supply chain environment further conversations for contract renewals for the expiring tolling agreements? Thanks.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Look, Alex, I think the way to think about Southern Power is twofold. One, it's projects they already have underway. And when it comes to that, I think they're incredibly well-positioned when it comes to this. The solar facility they have under construction is in great shape from that perspective. It's far enough along and materials on the ground enough that there's very little exposure there. There's a wind repowering project underway. I also feel pretty good about how we're protected there. Your question really spoke to new contracted gas in the future. And that's a little bit the beauty of our business model at Southern Power. We don't go out and do speculative projects where we build something and then go get a contract.\nIt's to get a contract, make sure the risk mitigations are in place for that contract, understand the environment we're in from a cost perspective, and then go execute. And so I feel confident that we'll have the ability to price in whatever the future holds in terms of cost to build new natural gas. There's always some degree of risk, but that's where we're also incredibly measured from a contingency and contractual provision perspective.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks. Just a quick one on the upcoming GRC, just sort of how you're thinking about it. It's an election year. The PSC has been more vocal. Just any sense how we should be thinking about the ask or the rate impact? You haven't filed yet, so our conversation's happening ahead of filings. Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. In responding to an earlier question, I think it's too early to really say what the filing will look like. I mean, there are a number of variables, puts and takes, and issues that have to be dealt with. Yeah, clearly, affordability is an issue that will be primary and at the forefront of our thinkings, but it's just, I think, simply too early to kind of say what all of that will look like. I mean, we're ordered to file, and we'll do that in early July. But I think it'd be a little bit premature to speak to kind of what the actual, and what some of the exact provisions and considerations will look like at this time.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGot it. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nThank you. Hello, everyone. Two-part question here. As you're going through the RFPs and any other generation contracting and look forward, how much is midstream becoming a constraint? And then you've also identified that to an extent as part of the upside CapEx opportunities. Is that something in midstream gas investment or a midstream gas joint venture, something like that, a potential that we might see midyear as you update it?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Travis, this is Dan. I'll take that. Is gas supply a focus for us as we look at these generation expansion plans? Absolutely. But I think we're incredibly well-positioned there. We're participating in a multitude of expansion projects in the Southeast as a procurer of natural gas. So locking up, if you would, firm transportation of natural gas to serve our needs well into the future. So I think there is a sufficient starting point for supply and a great line of sight for incremental supply. When it comes to our own investments, none of that is greenfield, brand new pipeline opportunities. We already have 50% interest in the Southern Natural Pipeline that kind of overlays our Southeast service territory. That's our largest midstream investment. Kinder Morgan operates that on behalf of our partnership.\nAnd then we've got a couple of other much smaller ventures where we are not the operator and are a passive owner of those facilities. And so these upside opportunities are largely associated with potential expansion projects of those pipelines, primarily brownfield, looping, very, very little greenfield exposure, and all in service territories that we know well.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nDan, one thing I would add, and from a broader policy perspective, I mean, I was at a meeting conference last week with Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and EPA administrator, as well as some other industry and data center hyperscalers. I mean, there's just broad consensus that to meet this growing demand, there's going to have to be more pipes being built as well as more transmission being built to make sure we have the capacity and the resources to meet this growing need. So yeah, I mean, that's part of our narrative and part of our conversation, expressing support for additional permitting reform to make sure that we can, in a timely manner, meet this growing demand by building out the infrastructure in this country.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nPerfect. No, that's great. I appreciate all those details. Now that I know you were in the room with a lot of important people, I got a lot of other questions, but we'll do that later. One other quick one. On the dividend policy, anything that the Board is looking at? I know you've been on that $0.08 and even $0.07 for a long time increase. Anything in particular metric-wise that the Board would look to get off of that 7% or 8% increase?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Look, I think from where we are today, it's a recognition that we've got a lot of financing to do and a big capital plan. A great source of equity is keeping the growth and dividend more modest than not. Doing so should help us drive our payout ratio a little further south.\nI think once we are kind of in the low 60% range somewhere, which would kind of be the back end of our plan if we stay at this pace, that's the time to step back and reevaluate. Do those capital opportunities and equity needs persist out into the future? If so, we might remain modest. If not, the board might have an opportunity to do something different.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities, Evercore ISI\n\nPerfect. Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nEVP and CFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet, Travis.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAgain, we thank you for your interest in Southern Company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Southern Company's Q1 2025 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGreg MacLeod\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Robert. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Q4 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent securities filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our investor relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 was an outstanding year for Southern Company, both operationally and financially. We achieved Adjusted Earnings at the very top of our EPS guidance range, which represents 11% growth from our 2023 adjusted results. All of our business units executed on their plans and delivered exceptional value to our customers and investors alike. I am incredibly proud of how our team continued to put customers first throughout 2024. While this is our daily mission, our dedication was especially evident as our team came together over the past year in response to several weather events which adversely impacted many of our customers, including the most destructive storm in Georgia Power's history this past fall. Delivering clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to the communities and customers we are privileged to serve will remain our top priority.\nLooking forward, we believe our portfolio of companies is incredibly well-positioned to capitalize on significant opportunities to serve growth and improve our local economies, and to sustain success over the long term. The foundation of our business model remains our state-regulated utility franchises. The tremendous value inherent in our three electric utilities and four natural gas distribution utilities is a function of our continuous focus on our nine million customers, our constructive regulatory environments with orderly processes, and service territories with strong long-term fundamentals. Economic development activities at our utilities are robust and should provide a tremendous foundation for regular, predictable, and sustainable long-term earnings growth. Over the past year, more than 150 companies either announced, expanded operations, or made the decision to locate new facilities in our Southeastern footprint. These projects are expected to support over 20,000 new jobs, further highlighting that the region we proudly serve is thriving.\nSome of the larger announcements over the past year were in the manufacturing, entertainment, chemical, and metals industries. The economic development pipeline from large electric load customers, including data centers and large manufacturers, represents over 50,000MW of potential incremental load by the mid-2030s. Data centers alone represent roughly 80% of that potential load. While our disciplined approach to forecasting results and a risk-adjusted outlook for sales growth comprise only a fraction of the economic development pipeline, we are encouraged to have commitments for over 10,000MW with advanced discussions in progress for even more. We remain committed to our approach to sustainably serving this exciting growth opportunity, including pricing and contract terms designed to protect our investments and provide economic benefits back to existing customers. We are also encouraged to see the data center momentum first observed in Georgia expanding into both Alabama and Mississippi.\nWe recently signed contracts to serve the power needs of data centers in these two states that total over 1,000 MW. While our state-regulated utilities are expected to represent approximately 95% of our projected capital investments, we have also continued to invest in our other complementary, strategically aligned businesses. Many of these businesses add depth to our vertical integration and provide us with unique market insights that help us attract and better serve customers in our regulated footprints. They also represent potential opportunities to add durability to our long-term earnings trajectory. Southern Power, our competitive power business, represents a terrific complement to our state-regulated businesses. Substantially all its assets are under long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties, and we don't take meaningful commodity risk.\nIn total, Southern Power's portfolio has approximately 13,000MW of capacity across 50+ generating facilities in 15 states, including approximately 7,000MW of natural gas generation, 3,000MW of solar, and 3,000MW of wind. Southern Power has 500MW of solar currently under construction with projected in-service dates in 2025 and 2026. We will continue to be opportunistic on new renewable energy projects that meet our stringent risk-return criteria. The burgeoning need for reliable, dispatchable natural gas capacity unlocks four significant opportunities for Southern Power. First, as contracts on our existing natural gas fleet come up for renewal beginning in the early 2030s, the load growth in the Southeast is expected to support future renewal pricing that is significantly higher than our existing contracts. Second, meaningful upgrade opportunities are being evaluated on Southern Power's legacy natural gas fleet.\nThese could translate into several hundred additional megawatts available to meet future market demands for capacity. Third, Southern Power has options at its existing plant sites to build new brownfield power plants in the Southeast. And lastly, Southern Power is exploring opportunities outside of the Southeast to serve data centers with new natural gas generation. We are very gratified to have developed and retained this incredibly valuable business as it represents a tremendous opportunity to support sustainable growth well into the next decade. In 2016, when Southern Company acquired what is now Southern Company Gas, we sought to further vertically integrate along the energy value chain. An important additional element of that vertical integration was our 50% investment in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline, which overlays our three electric service territories as well as one of our largest natural gas franchises.\nAs previously disclosed by our operating partner, Kinder Morgan, this pipeline is poised for growth, largely to support increased natural gas generation throughout the Southeast. Southern Natural Gas, as well as our other smaller FERC-related pipeline investments, provide a terrific complement to our core growth prospects. Even two of our smaller subsidiaries, both of which have seen accelerated growth recently due to expanding computing power demand, have been incredibly valuable for deeper appreciation and understanding of the current market. PowerSecure, which specializes in providing utility and energy solutions to commercial, industrial, and load-serving customers, has seen its business bolstered by the growth in data centers. This has led to a more comprehensive understanding of data center needs and has enhanced our relationships with many national data center owners. Another example of the value in our smaller complementary subsidiaries is Southern Telecom.\nOn its own and in partnership with our electric utilities, Southern Telecom deploys fiber optic infrastructure that serves as an important and attractive additional product offering, enhancing the appeal to data-intensive customers to locate in our southeastern service territories. Over time, we have exercised exceptional discipline and intentionality in refining our portfolio of businesses. We believe this has uniquely positioned Southern Company to deliver reliable and affordable energy to our customers, as well as to deliver premier risk-adjusted total shareholder returns to our investors. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris. I'm going to pause. Robert, can you hear us, operator?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, I can. Very clearly.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. We're being told that none of the audience can hear the audio.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. I just sent a message to our supervisor. Yeah. Everything looks fine on my end.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nOkay. Thank you. We'll continue. I'm getting mixed reports now. So we'll continue, and what we'll do, I believe this is being recorded. It'll be available for webcast, and hopefully the Q&A goes as part. Thank you, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. You're welcome.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, Chris. So look, as you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $4.05 for 2024, which, as Chris mentioned earlier, was the very top of our 2024 guidance range and represents 11% growth from Adjusted Earnings from the prior year. The primary drivers for our performance compared to 2023 were continued investment in our state-regulated utilities and weather-related impacts. A complete reconciliation of our quarterly and annual Adjusted Earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Turning now to electricity sales, excluding the impact of temporary sales losses due to Hurricane Helene, weather-normalized total retail electricity sales for the year were up approximately 1% compared to 2023. Commercial sales were particularly strong, led by power usage from new and existing data centers, which were up 17% year over year.\n2024 was our strongest year on record in terms of new residential electric customers. We added 57,000 new residential electric customers, as well as 26,000 new customers in our natural gas distribution businesses. These trends highlight the broad strength we continue to observe across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. We expect this momentum to continue into 2025, with retail electricity sales on a consolidated basis projected to grow approximately 2% to 3% compared to 2024 weather normal sales. Longer term, we project average annual sales growth of approximately 8% from 2025 through 2029, an increase of 2% from our prior long-term sales growth expectations. Georgia Power's total retail electric sales growth is projected to be approximately 12% over the same period.\nOur commercial segment, which includes data centers and currently represents approximately 1/3 of total retail electricity sales, is projected to grow an average of 18% from 2025 to 2029. As we have highlighted several times in the past, we take a very measured and disciplined approach to forecasting incremental electric load. As Chris mentioned in his remarks, the extraordinary growth in our forecast represents a fraction of the total economic development pipeline. Informed by our experience and continuous engagement with prospective and existing customers, our forecasts are significantly risk-adjusted as it pertains to both timing and load size. Serving this load reliably requires significant capital investments in the coming years. Our base capital investment forecast over the next five years is $63 billion, 95% of which is at our state-regulated utilities. This represents a $14 billion, or an approximately 30% increase from our forecast just one year ago.\nIn addition to increases for previously announced new projects at Southern Power and the expansion plans for our largest interstate natural gas pipeline, incremental investment in our transmission system is the largest driver of increased capital expenditures in our forecast. Our capital investment plan supports projected long-term state-regulated average annual rate-based growth of approximately 7%, a 1% increase from our forecast one year ago. Our forecast reflects an approach to capital forecasting consistent with that which we have used in the past, in that we have not included potential capital investments, primarily new or expanded generation resources, which remain subject to regulatory processes. For example, there are outstanding requests for proposals, or RFPs, for new resources from previously approved Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans, or IRPs, that represent approximately 13,000MW.\nThere are also potential incremental FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline investments to meet the increasing energy needs of customers in the Southeast. Combined, we estimate that reasonable outcomes for these opportunities represent a potential range of incremental regulated capital investments totaling $10 billion to $15 billion for 2025 to 2029. As a reminder, we are currently in active regulatory processes for the vast majority of these opportunities, and given the timing of these ongoing regulatory processes, it's likely that we could have better line of sight on a substantial portion of these potential incremental investments later this year, at which time we could update our base capital investment plan. The financing plan we have provided supports our base capital plan and continues to fund the business in a credit-supportive manner.\nPreserving our investment-grade credit ratings continues to be a priority, as we believe that to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must also be a high-quality credit. Our base plan projects average annual equity needs of approximately $800 million a year to support our credit quality and our progress toward our credit metric target of approximately 17% FFO to debt by the latter part of our forecast horizon. These equity needs should be easily manageable with our internal plans, which provide approximately $350 million to $400 million annually, plus our At-the-Market, or ATM, program. To the extent incremental capital opportunities become part of our base capital investment plan, our credit quality objectives would remain the same. Accordingly, we would expect to fund incremental capital investments above our current plan with approximately 30% to 40% equity or equity equivalents.\nWe expect to continue to be flexible and to use the same shareholder-focused discipline we have demonstrated historically when it comes to sourcing incremental equity or equity equivalents. Since our last Earnings Call, we've already addressed roughly $500 million of equity needs for 2025 by pricing ATM sales under forward contracts and through the issuance of junior subordinated notes, or JSNs, which receive 50% equity treatment by the credit rating agencies. For decades, our dividend has been an integral part of our value proposition for shareholders. Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year for 77 consecutive years, with consecutive increases over each of the last 23 years. While future dividend increases are subject to approval by our board of directors, we project continued modest increases in the dividend over our forecast horizon.\nThis should serve to lower our dividend payout ratio into the low- to mid-60% range as we balance our equity needs with this very important component of our value proposition. Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2025 and beyond, our Adjusted Earnings per share guidance range for 2025 is $4.20 to 4.30 per share. Our adjusted guidance midpoint of $4.25 represents 6% growth from our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint. Our projected long-term adjusted EPS growth rate guidance is unchanged at 5% to 7% from our 2024 guidance. Clearly, we are seeing strong fundamentals that we expect to support our long-term growth. These growth drivers become increasingly significant in the latter years of our forecast horizon.\nAt the same time, interest rates, which are now expected to be higher for even longer, continue to be a partially offsetting factor as our parent company debt gets refinanced at meaningfully higher rates than the securities outstanding today. That said, we are increasingly encouraged about the strength of our long-term earnings outlook. All else being equal and assuming the current positive momentum continues, including the potential for a significant portion of the incremental capital opportunities we've highlighted materializing, we believe our long-term adjusted EPS should be near the top of our projected long-term range. Assuming this potentially improved trajectory appears sustainable, we also could be positioned to rebase our 5% to 7% projected growth trajectory at a higher starting point as early as 2027. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. We are very excited about the future here at Southern Company. When it comes to the incredible load growth we see, our objective is to serve as much of this growing electric load as we can sustainably serve. The vertically integrated state-regulated service territories that we are privileged to serve are proving well-suited to attracting these large load customers. And thanks to integrated resource plans and the other orderly processes inherent in our regulated frameworks, our market is also perhaps proven to be better suited than the unregulated markets at effectively deploying new resources to serve them. Our disciplined approach to forecasting these needs will continue to include a measured, risk-adjusted methodology, as well as pricing and contract terms for new large load customers that continue to benefit and protect our existing customers and investors. As we continue to grow, strong credit quality remains paramount.\nThis important buffer against adversity distinguishes Southern Company from much of the industry and serves to insulate investors from sudden market impacts as the world around us changes. Additionally, one of my top priorities is our team here at Southern Company. We believe we have one of the most talented and deepest benches in the industry. Continuing to prioritize and invest in the development of our future leaders is crucial to maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring our continued long-term success. And finally, we aspire to deliver premier risk-adjusted total returns to investors. Our aim is to be a high-quality, must-own stock and a company built to endure. And we believe delivering exceptional value to our shareholders is best achieved by putting our customers first, including providing reliable and affordable energy.\nWe had a phenomenal year in 2024, and I'm extremely proud of all we have accomplished as one team across our company. Southern Company is poised for a bright future, and I could not be more excited for the opportunities ahead of us. Thank you for joining us this afternoon, and thank you for your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nBefore we do, let me just say thanks for everyone's patience. The webcast apparently was only not working temporarily. The dial-in was working fine. We will have the entirety of the recording posted for replay after the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the updates today. Maybe just to start on the Earnings Growth Cadence, could you just flesh out your comments a bit more there just in terms of where you could trend in that\nfive to seven range as we move through the five years of the current plan, just as you think about the increased rate-based growth and the upside capital investment opportunities, and maybe just anything that you see at this point that could potentially derail that trend?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nSure, Carly. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. Look, I think the first thing to say is what we've continued to reinforce over time is we are where we were, right? We have this terrific outlook, five to seven long-term. Now we are seeing some incremental fundamental things being additive to the overall profile. Look, the words we're using are adding durability. That's not code for anything. That's simply suggesting that this is not a fight every year to just get to where we need to be. There are enough fundamentals coming into play that this is a long-term outlook that we're beginning to get even more confidence in being able to sustain for a long period of time.\nAnd so with this incremental update that we just had today and the potential incremental capital that we could get more clarity on in the very foreseeable future, we're solidly within our range and potentially, with those incremental updates, sustainably near the top. And I think how we feel positioned, again, in the long term as early as 2027, is to be able to not change the five to seven per se, but perhaps start that growth rate from a higher sustained point. In the near term, we are where we were.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. That's super helpful. Appreciate that. And then maybe just on that $10 to 15 billion of investment opportunities above the plan, could you talk a little bit about how we should think about the split between sort of what's at Georgia Power versus you referenced that natural gas pipeline opportunity, and any color in terms of sort of the outcomes that underpin that estimated CapEx?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, absolutely. It is substantially all Georgia Power. There is some degree of the natural gas pipelines. I think in our 10-K, we disclosed the number of up to $14 billion associated with that Georgia Power item. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks for those that could hear them, the regulatory processes are ongoing for those. And so we're going to maintain the same discipline we have in the past. We're not going to get ahead of digging into details and speaking to that. So around July, we'll start to get some clarity. What I will say is, look, the dollars are substantial. If you look at the RFPs that are on slide 16 and the nature of those, I'll just give you historical context, right? I mean, the AllSource, as an example, that's a big megawatt amount. And historically, AllSource RFPs have tended to be larger dispatchable resources.\nIn the market environment we've been in historically, those often turned into power purchase agreements. In the current market, all of that excess capacity previously kind of bid in as purchases, I say all, a substantial amount is being soaked up by all the load-serving entities in the region. The availability of excess capacity is much tighter. The likelihood of having to build new is much greater. I'll stop there, Carly, and see if that addresses your question.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat does. Thank you so much for the color.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Carly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Julien.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good afternoon, team. Very nicely done. I feel the confidence exuding from you guys. With that said, just maybe to add to the commentary on the regulated side of the business, you provided a number of comments about Southern Power. Is there any kind of metric you can disclose around the cumulative earnings trajectory that you guys are seeing there today or the potential of repowering on a cumulative basis through the early part of the decade? Obviously, you have a number of different assets at which prices are not disclosed that come up. So clearly, there's an opportunity. It's just difficult to discern externally. And how does that add incrementally, ultimately, to that commentary on five to seven, if you can elaborate, if you don't mind?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Happy to answer that, Julien. And what I would say, again, I'll keep coming back to the work because I think it just fits. The opportunities at Southern Power really play into this concept of durability and the sustainability, if you will, of that trajectory over the long term. Substantially all of Southern Power's current assets are under long-term contracts. And that's true through the end of this decade. And so the opportunities that exist for recontracting all kind of lend themselves to benefits into the next decade, kind of adding to that durability concept.\nWhen it comes to options to build new brownfield gas plants or to build new generation outside of the Southeast, those two lend themselves to a similar timeframe, not because of a lack of opportunity, but because of what you're seeing broadly in the industry in terms of the timeline to deploy such resources, getting new equipment, and then obviously the construction process. And so that too becomes a kind of end-of-the-plan into-the-next-decade opportunity. In the interim, we're actively in the process of repowering our first repowering project at one of our wind facilities. We've got new solar facilities under construction. I think you'll see us continue to kind of be opportunistic, if you will, where those opportunities make sense. They may be very limited, but if we see them and we like them, we'll certainly pursue them.\nAll of that to say, Julien, Southern Power will kind of remain. I'd characterize it as just a steady contributor to the status quo. The opportunity exists at the end of the period and into the next decade.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nJulien, one thing I would add, I mean, I think even us having this conversation speaks to show you kind of how these complementary businesses afford us greater durability with the opportunities we see in the marketplace today and the excitement that we have around them. We've not had a lot of discussion about them in the past, but as we see what is transpiring in the marketplace today and the opportunities that are in front of us with these complementary businesses, we thought it was important to share what we see and what we understand, but how this supports kind of our path, our earnings growth in terms of where we're headed, but also how it supports our durability.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. If I can supplement that question further, I mean, you talk about retail sales accelerating, obviously, within your regulated confines. How do you think about leveraging the sites themselves for colocation opportunities or supplementing not just with repowering, but additional outright potential gas turbines here to serve these data center opportunities? I mean, again, if you think about Southern Power, not just recontracting, but truly additional within or in adjacent service territories, how does that fit into the plan as well, just to be clear?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Hey, Julien. So if you're looking at slide eight in our deck for Southern Power, kind of getting to the heart of what you're asking in terms of leveraging what's happening in the Southeast, the things to look to there are uprates on the current natural gas fleet opportunity, brownfield gas plants in the Southeast. Again, when we talk about the pipeline, you see it on one of our other slides, that pipeline of 50gW through the mid-2030s. So this is clearly a very long-term opportunity. Southern Power absolutely has the opportunity to play into that. You mentioned kind of colocation, etc. That's not part of our market design, and we're perfectly fine with that. We appreciate and are benefited by this wonderful vertically integrated market that we operate in.\nBut in terms of them being able to, Southern Power being able to serve load-serving entities that are then in turn serving data centers, tremendous opportunity.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. All the best, guys. Congratulations.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Fleischmann with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you, Steve?\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI'm doing great. Thanks, Chris and Dan. So appreciate the additional color on the capital plan and potential kind of growth opportunity. Just wanted clarity on one piece of that. So Dan, you mentioned the ability to reach the high end and also mentioned this possibility of rebasing. And I guess, first of all, why is 2027 kind of a key year for that? That might drive it. And is there any way to give any sense of the size of rebasing that might be there? Yeah.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. So this won't surprise you. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. And so in terms of assessing the magnitude of any rebasing, let's just wait until we rebase, if that happens, to measure it. In terms of why 2027, it's a lot of different moving parts. It's, to a large degree, exactly what we keep describing. This tremendous growth that is happening is long-term in nature. The ramp-up in the capital spending and the revenues from these large load customers are more back-end loaded in the plan than not. But it also, and I mentioned this very briefly in the prepared remarks, is a function of what's happening right in front of us with interest costs.\nSo that is probably the biggest ballast in the early years and kind of weighting it down to a degree as we refinance some of our existing securities that are today at ultra-low rates that are having to be refinanced in this current market. But then once we get past that and these opportunities really become more tangible than just a forecast and we feel really good about them, that's kind of, said a different way, that's really what's behind the 2027.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay. So basically, some of the headwind maybe moderates, then that's in there in the earlier years from this. Got it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThere's only so much debt that needs to be refinanced.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYes. That's good. Okay. And then I guess just in terms of, I think you recently got approval for a change in the way that you can contract with data centers in Georgia. So I guess I'd be curious kind of what have you been doing before that? And what are you now able to do differently going forward that.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSteve, I'll say.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Steve, we were doing a lot of that already. I think the codification and the signaling to the data center customers was something that I think has been very appreciative to them and into the marketplace. But yeah, as you know, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved these rules and regs in January to just make sure all the risk and costs associated with these large load customers, 100-plus MW, to make sure that there was balance and a fair approach to all customers, providing tools like credit requirements, longer-term contracts from five to 15 years, minimum billing, and site-specific costs already being paid by customers. These things were already being done. But I think that kind of certainty and codification of these processes brings more certainty and clarity to the marketplace. So I mean, some of it's new and different, but some of it's not.\nWe were already deploying a lot of these practices before.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And I'll tell you one of the ones that are kind of incremental, Steve, that we think is just going to bring tremendous benefits to us in kind of executing on serving this growth are some of the creditor collateral requirements that are going to be required of customers in our pipeline. Those provisions are, frankly, going to help us weed out the more speculative projects. And so the result of that optically, for those that are watching, you may see the size of the pipeline shrink a little bit over the next three to six months. That's not because the customers that are ultimately going to end up locating in our state have gone away. It's because the more speculative ones are unwilling to kind of put up the collateral necessary in order to stay in the queue.\nThe feedback we've heard from many of the large customers, the customer names you'd be familiar with that want to build all this infrastructure, are excited about these changes, because it helps them ensure that the company is focused on serving the needs that are, for lack of a better term, more real than not.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet, Steve.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Anthony.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, Corp. Good afternoon, Chris. What's up, Dan? You guys, great update. Stock clearly responding. Just a quick, I guess, housekeeping. The 5% to 7% growth rate from 2024, is that off of 2024 actual or off the midpoint of the 2024 range?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nIt's off of our 2024 guidance, so yeah, not off actual. We're just trying to reflect the kind of normal course of business, not any kind of one-time things that might be in the number.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Perfect. And on slide 17, I think maybe following up on Carly's question earlier, the $10 to $15 billion capital investments, the company typically gives us this refresh on this Q4 call. Just how will the announcements go or how can we track chipping away at this wood here? Is it on your quarterly updates or should we wait until Q4?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI think with the clarity we'll have, it's certainly possible that by the time of our Q2 call, we could provide a little more visibility on this. I think the Q4 will remain kind of our official time to update everything. But with the magnitude and pace of this, perhaps there'll be an update in July.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. And just last one, I think it's on Steve's question. You talked about the parent debt and some of the financing on slide 26. Thanks for the clarity. But on the nine billion of parent debt over the next three years that mature, do you have an average coupon? And if not, I could follow up offline. I wasn't looking to put you on the hot seat there.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Follow up with IR to kind of get something a little more specific. I'm sure that's all available and in the Form 10-K. But just in terms of magnitude, largely these are having to be refinanced at rates that are in some cases 150 to 200 basis points higher.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the clarity. And again, great update.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Anthony.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, how are you doing? Thanks so much. I was wondering if you could touch on what you're seeing in terms of the availability of gas turbines and what the pricing backdrop is looking like. I'm thinking you've got All-Source RFPs coming up that may lean toward dispatchable gas generation over time. Seems like there could be more coming in your plans in the future. And then also thinking about Southern Power. So I guess what's your access to turbines these days?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nWe feel pretty good. I mean, we have diversified our suppliers, and we are engaged with a number of different suppliers. Clearly, we're having to pay reservation fees to get in line. But I mean, I'll tell you right now, we feel pretty good about where we are because of our history with these OEMs and having this diverse supplier experience that we've been engaged with over a number of years. So yeah, it's challenging. I mean, there's a heavy demand on the supplier part, but right now we're having ongoing conversations with them, letting them know what our needs are. And like I said, we're making the reservations to make sure we're in line to respond to the needs that we have.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nWe're doing the exact same thing, Dave, with EPC providers.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Excellent. Thanks for that color. And let me see, Dan, I was curious, just looking at FFO to Debt in the path here, 15.5% when you exclude the storm impact. Could you talk about the trajectory when you'd be aiming for that 17% FFO to Debt level and kind of describe the path to get there from here?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, absolutely, Dave. Look, I'd characterize it, particularly with our base forecast, kind of the middle to late part of our five-year horizon is certainly reasonable and achievable. And again, I mentioned if we have this increased capital need, the objective doesn't change, but we're going to take a measured approach as to how we get there. I think back half of the plan is still perfectly reasonable. I will say what you'll see in 2025 is a little bit of, I don't know, flat-ish kind of trend in the FFO to Debt. And again, from that adjusted number that you mentioned, Dave, that's the right place to start. And that's really attributable to the same thing. It's the fact that there will be some lag in the storm costs getting addressed, and it's unlikely they'll begin to get recovered in 2025.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Understood. Thanks so much.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, David.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHi.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\nGood. Good. Thanks. Thanks for all the detail today. A lot of growth coming through there. And maybe just want to peel back a little bit more on Alabama and Mississippi there. I think you talked about data centers, a bit of growth there. But just wondering, I guess, if you could provide a bit more color of what you've seen there, what could the upside be there over time? It seems like these states, Mississippi in particular, is really kind of pursuing some of the growth more aggressively than others. And just any other thoughts would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. In Alabama, there was a Meta project that was announced mid-last year, I think. And it was a couple hundred megawatts, I think. I mean, there's more activity occurring there now. Their broader economic development pipeline is very full of activities and projects in Mississippi. Mississippi, I think, did publicly announce the Compass Project. And then they also had a chemical manufacturer that expanded the line. So there was significant capacity opportunities for them. So I think we said it earlier, we see this migration, this activity moving westward across our territory. And once again, it adds to that excitement and the opportunities we see across our company and across just in the future.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful there. Just want to pivot towards nuclear for a minute if I could. Clearly, Southern has been a leader here historically, but in the marketplace, there's been some trepidation with new builds given some of the issues in the past. Just wondering any updated thoughts you could share there. It seems like there's strong stakeholder momentum building there, and particularly as it relates to if a federal backstop were to come together on EPC in case of for catastrophic insurance, or if a hyperscaler is really willing to step in for that similar type of protection there, I guess, how that could impact your thought process at this point in time?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. This country needs more nuclear. I mean, nuclear is the best long-term fit for the kind of low growth that the industry is experiencing right now. All stop. Be perfectly clear. You've identified the risk, and whether it's through federal activity or whether it's through some private concerns willing to participate, those risks must be mitigated. And yes, I mean, we're going to continue to make the case to tell the story, talk about the virtues that we're experiencing with Vogtle three and four, and how well these Units are running and the value of them with this growth that we're experiencing, and what we experienced as we went from Unit three to Unit four in terms of efficiency gains.\nI mean, so there's a wonderful story there for this country to begin to make this investment in building more nuclear units because the more we build, the greater efficiencies we experience, supply chains, workforce, all aspects of this process, we get better at it. And that will help us with each project as we move forward. So yeah, I mean, we're going to continue to work with our partners, work with others, other utility companies to talk about the virtues and the benefits and the value of new nuclear going forward.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, Dan.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Dan.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey. Hey, Chris and Dan. See you guys in a few weeks. Hey, just one.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nCan't wait.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. Yeah. I look forward. Just one quick question. We've discussed a lot already, and all my other questions have been answered. Just that reconciling the CapEx increase to equity. So CapEx went up $13 billion, and looks like you only gave partial equity last time around. Now this time, you've given the equity throughout the five-year plan. Thank you for doing that. But just it would put the equity on my map at roughly 20% of the capital increase, and you pointed to 30% to 40%. So maybe what are the moving pieces? Is it slowing down dividend growth? Is it more tax transferability monetization? Just what are the moving pieces there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Georges, I want to cop out and just say it's all of the above. I mean, you really did hit on some of the key things. It is the other cash flow improvements. The transferability is certainly supporting the overall five-year plan with all the tax credits that we have, the kind of everything that we've done to kind of take equity need off the table prior to this, not just the $500 million worth that we took off the table for 2025, but just how we thought about our financing plan last year with equity content. It's also just making sure that we are taking a pragmatic long-term view on our objectives, right? I think we are incredibly well-positioned.\nWe definitely prioritize having that buffer against adversity, but there's absolutely no need to knee-jerk to hit a particular number in any particular year as long as our long-term objectives and discipline remain.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Dan. Would you happen to have the tax credit number handy? What are you monetizing in terms of dollars on average?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI don't have that. Certainly follow up with the IR team. We can give you some sense of that. But again, it's really just things for whether it's Southern Power projects or storage assets in the regulated business. A lot of our tax credits can't be kind of transferred. We've got nuclear PTCs for Vogtle three and four that can't be transferred. All of our legacy credits prior to IRA that we're underlining can't be transferred. But the transferring of the new ones means that we can monetize the old ones at the same time. So that's part of the uplift as well.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Paul.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Paul.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nHey. Congratulations. My questions, I guess, sort of relate to Southern Power. Maybe the first question would be, is it practical for somebody to consider finishing the Summer plant or restarting construction on the Summer plant?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNot Southern Power. I mean, seriously, I mean, we know there's a process underway. Not sure how that's going to play out and what that will look like. I would suspect it will also end up with a need for some of the things we talked about to mitigate some risk. I mean, unless somebody's willing to put up the necessary capital to cover it. But it's kind of a novel idea, but we'll see how that plays out. But most certainly, that is not something in the wheelhouse of Southern Power. No consideration of that.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nWhen you talk about sort of construction by Southern Power of gas outside of your utility service territories, would it be logical to look at where you have gas LDCs as to where that new construction might take place?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nNo, not necessarily, Paul. If you think about Southern Power's existing portfolio, so put the gas aside. So we used to have gas assets in various parts of the country. We had some in Minnesota, and we had some in Florida and other places. We've largely divested of everything but what's in the Southeast. But our renewable portfolio kind of spans the Southwest and the Midwest, and it's really where the market design is kind of ripe for bilateral agreements like that. In some cases, serving load-serving entities. But what you're able to do in some of those other markets, as you well know, is have kind of direct arrangements with large commercial and industrial customers. And we've done a lot of that with our renewable fleet. We'll look for those kind of opportunities on the gas side.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nThen last question for me, would there come a point in time where you would consider a potential spinoff of your Southern Power subsidiary?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI mean, we're going to look at everything all the time. That's not in our plan today. I'll tell you, we're gratified to have held on to this business when others didn't. It has tremendous optionality. Selling it certainly would be dilutive. Spinning it off, we'll see how big it gets and whether or not that seems to make sense. But we love it as a complement to our portfolio today.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company",
    "content2": "And Paul, I mean, I think we've said this before. I mean, we love the cards we have. And as all the utilities and these other complementary businesses, the contributions they make, the participation they make, the opportunities they afford us, we think supports just our principal objectives and the long-term durability of our company. So yeah, I mean, as Dan said it, but kind of, we're very pleased with the cards we have.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Paul.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar Research\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you. It's a little chilly up here in the Chicago suburbs, so keep that gas flowing for us.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nWait, are you in the Nicor territory?\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar Research\n\nNicor, that's my house. Yep. Right underneath the big neighborhood pipe. So yeah, keep it going and don't blow up any pipe, please.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks for your business.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar Research\n\nSure. You're welcome. I got the bill on the table, and I'll make sure to pay it in the next couple of days. But anyway, aside from that, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the dynamic between generation CapEx and transmission CapEx, especially in 2028, 2029. Looks like a lower, even not immaterial number on the generation side, yet obviously all the load growth you talked about, and then the large number on the transmission side. Is transmission really the need here to serve that large load, or would there be more generation coming?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. That's a very fair question, Travis. It really gets back to how we have bifurcated the capital outlook here. There is better line of sight on the transmission. Typically, just given our structure, that's something that, unlike a generation resource, can't be purchased from a third party in our market. We're vertically integrated. The generation tends to have optionality around it. You can buy excess capacity from others. You've got to go through a process to determine the best resource. As I mentioned, we've got 13,000 or 13, yeah, 13 gW about sending RFPs just in Georgia alone right now. Once that firms up, that potential capital of $10 to 15 billion includes a lot of dollars associated with those very same generation resources you're trying to find in the table.\nOnce they materialize to the extent they do, that's when you'll see them kind of marry up with the transmission.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar Research\n\nOkay. That makes sense. Yeah. That goes back to your comment about the PPAs and maybe not satisfying all the RFP requests out there, right?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThat's right.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar Research\n\nYeah. Okay. And then one quick follow-up. In terms of transmission supply chain, that equipment, what's the availability there? What does that look like? There's a lot of talk about the generation side of it, but what about the transmission side of it?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nIt's challenging also, but not as difficult on the generation side. But once again, with the size and scale of our company and engagement of the work that we involve ourselves in, we find ourselves in a pretty good place. But it's work that our supply chain organization is constantly staying on top of, assessing the market, working with our suppliers and vendors to make sure we understand what the dynamics are, and making sure we let them know what our needs are now and into the future.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar Research\n\nAbsolutely. Okay. Very good. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nHi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Are you looking at any policy support to help attract data center growth in Alabama specifically? And are you looking at any changes to tariff design for these hyperscaler customers like the changes made in Georgia?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I'm not aware of any tariff legislation or incentives in Alabama at this time. I mean, they do have, as they do overall economic development, there are some incentive packages that they have available, but I'm not aware of any kind of legislative effort underway. And the second part of your question was?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Tariffs. I'll take that, Ryan. And look, we've got tremendous flexibility in the way we contract with large load customers. There's really not any kind of changes necessary to attract, serve, and price appropriately those customers.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay. I appreciate the time.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet, Ryan.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAgain, let me thank each of you for taking time to spend time with us today, and thank you for your interest in Southern Company. We are incredibly excited about our future, and we look forward to talking to you again in the future. Thank you very much, and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Q4 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect, and we thank you for your participation."

My name is Sherry, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the Southern Company's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Sherry. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information.\nVarious important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. We believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2024. All our businesses, electric and gas, are performing well, and we continue to see both economic resilience and economic growth, especially within our Southeast service territories.\nDuring the most recent heat wave across the Southeast, our dedicated employees, supported by our coordinated planning, ensured our electric system delivered outstanding reliability and resiliency for the customers and communities that we are privileged to serve. Last quarter represented the warmest Q2 in the last 38 years, with a peak electric load of over 38,000 MW, the third highest June peak electric load on record for the Southern Company system. We take tremendous pride in our ability to reliably serve our customers through all operating conditions.\nOur performance continues to highlight the value of the integrated regulated framework in which we operate. Coordinating planning for generation and transmission, as well as our robust portfolio of natural gas transportation capacity and storage, have positioned us to effectively manage peak demand needs. This same framework, including our orderly internal and external regulatory processes for long-term demand planning and resource decisions, is what also positions us so well to reliably serve the significant electric load growth projected over the next decade, an opportunity we are excited about. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.10 per share, $0.31 higher than the second quarter of 2023, and $0.20 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state-regulated utilities and warmer-than-normal weather for our electric subsidiaries. This was somewhat offset by higher interest and depreciation expenses. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the third quarter is $1.30 per share.\nAs Chris noted, all of our businesses experienced a strong second quarter, leading to adjusted financial results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share. The warmer-than-normal weather in the second quarter contributed to these results, as well as our continued focus on managing operating costs. Additionally, during the second quarter, we experienced higher-than-expected weather-adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class.\nThese higher sales were driven by a combination of continued strength in our local economies, as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. In fact, sales to existing data centers for the quarter were up approximately 17% year-over-year. The strong Southeast economy, including favorable business climates and expansions in manufacturing, continues to drive net in-migration and customer growth. For Q2, we saw residential customer additions of 14,000 in our electric businesses and 6,000 in our natural gas distribution businesses.\nWe also continue to see strong economic development activity across our electric service territories. The aggregate pipeline for potential new industrial and commercial customers across our three-state electric utility footprint includes nearly 200 projects and over 30 GW of potential load over the next decade or so. While it's likely these numbers include some degree of duplication in potential projects as some prospective customers are evaluating multiple states that we serve for their facilities, these numbers are significantly higher than what we've seen historically.\nAbout 40% of the projects in the pipeline, and 80% of the potential electric load are data centers. In addition to data centers, clean energy and transportation manufacturing, port-related businesses, and other heavy industries continue to be attracted to our states due to reliable energy, a diverse workforce, robust transportation networks, and a low cost of living, all compelling reasons to locate or expand in our southeastern states. The potential load growth from this pipeline that is reflected in our forecast is currently only a fraction of this full potential.\nAs a reminder, during our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is expected to accelerate in the latter part of this decade, with a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth is approximately 9% over the same period.\nIn response to this growth, Georgia Power filed and the Georgia Public Service Commission subsequently approved earlier this year its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan update. Since the time of the original filing last year, Georgia Power's pipeline of potential large load additions by the mid-2030s has grown approximately 40%, and the amount of committed peak demand over the same timeframe has more than doubled, now totaling over 7 GW.\nAs we described in detail on our last earnings call, we continue to execute on our disciplined approach to attracting, serving, pricing, and forecasting this potential incremental electric load. We continue to expect that our disciplined approach to pricing this new load should result in revenues that not only cover the incremental cost to serve these new customers, it also provides economic benefits to existing customers. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Southern Company remains focused on execution, and we're excited about the future. We believe we are well-positioned to capture the value of this significant electricity demand for the benefits of all stakeholders. Our orderly and proven processes for engaging with prospective customers and for addressing resource needs with our regulators differentiate Southern Company from our peers and help mitigate risk for our customers and our investors.\nAdditionally, prospective electric customers are increasingly recognizing the value of our institutional experience and wherewithal, the value of the great states we operate in, and the value of the vertically integrated regulated utility model. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hundreds of team members from Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, who recently returned home after aiding in power restorations in Texas following the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl.\nThese teams and others from across our industry work tirelessly to bring relief to affected communities, and their performance throughout the successful restoration effort stands as a testament that our employees are at their very best when conditions are at their worst. Let me conclude by saying we have delivered very strong operational and financial results for the first half of this year. We will remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan, and we believe that we are extraordinarily well-positioned to deliver the superior performance that you expect from us for the remainder of the year. Operator, we're now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. And for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Good afternoon. How are you? Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe just to start on the quarter itself, just with the significant beat relative to your initial $0.90 guidance, how are you thinking about the puts and takes around the full year guidance and your execution there at this point?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nLook, we're always very cautious. While we're halfway through the year, there's a lot of year left to go. In particular, with our electric utilities being in the Southeast, the summer is a pretty big period from a revenue perspective. We typically hone in on a more specific expectation after our third quarter call. That said, to your point, we are incredibly well-positioned. We're off to a great start.\nWhat we also have a history of doing is really taking that kind of opportunity and doing anything and everything that we can to not only deliver on the current year, but use that as an opportunity to improve our positioning for future years. That might look like advancing maintenance work out of future years into 2024 or getting ahead on other programs. There are reliability reserves. We have the opportunity to optimize in some of our states. With how we're positioned, we're working hard to do all those things, focus on this year, but focus on the long term. All that to say, given how we started, if we don't end up in the top half of our range, I think Chris and I would be disappointed.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nDan, I think as we say internally a lot, when we have the opportunity to fix the roof while the sun is shining, and so thinking about 2024, 2025, and 2026, those are some things we'll consider as we continue to move forward through this year.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Appreciate that color. Then the follow-up, just would love to get your perspectives on nuclear as it continues to gain focus here. What do you think the industry needs to do to support the build-out of new large-scale nuclear?As you think about the 2025 Georgia IRP filing, is there any potential to see nuclear play a role there?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nCarly, I think the industry has got to continue to do all the planning, all the reviews, working with industries to look at what all the possibilities may be. I think to ultimately get that build-out and get the momentum, we've got to have incredible leadership from the government to make this a reality. We know there are risks, and I think we all must find ways, and support from the government can help mitigate some of that risk. I think that is the critical element in terms of really gaining the momentum to build on what we got done by completing Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\nI think it's got to be a part of the future. It's got to be a part of the mix. We've got to have diverse resources to meet this demand we see going forward. Nuclear's got to play a very prominent part in that role, but I think there's got to be and needs to be great leadership from the government to really help build the momentum that we need to see. I'll leave it at that.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the comments.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nWhat's up, Shar? How are you doing?\n\nShar Pourezza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good. How are you doing, Chris?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nDoing great, man.\n\nShar Pourezza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nExcellent. Maybe a quick one for Dan. Dan, I can totally appreciate the conservativeness and how you're messaging around this year, but obviously, we are seeing the reality of your footprint is much stronger than your planning assumptions. I know you've talked about in the past that maybe you can provide an update in the fourth quarter or potentially EI timeframe of what all this means to your longer-range guidance. What other trigger points are you looking for outside of sustainability around this load backdrop to really revisit how you guys think about a longer-range plan?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nShar, I know you said besides sustainability, but it really is rooted in that notion of continued momentum. Look, I think we feel good about what we know and see right in front of us, and that's a large part of what we addressed in this recent Georgia proceeding.\nWe've got the 2025 IRP ahead of us that will provide an opportunity to further button up the latter part of the decade and into the next decade for, again, what we know sitting here today, the opportunity. It certainly feels like there is continued increased momentum. The opportunity is that assuming that continues, there will inevitably be more capital investment needed to serve continued load growth, whether that's in the form of new generation resources, certainly transmission improvements around the system.\nThe thing I want to balance all of that with, and I think we've continued to say this, this is really a later-in-the-decade phenomenon. This is not a 2025 thing. This is starting to bleed into 2026. Because of the long-term nature of these capital investments, because of the long-term nature of building out these data centers, this is an opportunity that sustains beyond the current forecast period, the kind of financial profile and strength that we see.\n\nShar Pourezza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Got it. That's helpful. Chris, on your end, I know obviously we've got a Georgia GRC coming. It's going to come sooner than we think. There's been some noise around ROEs and equity ratios maybe being overly adequate now that Vogtle is online from just some of the commissioners. Can you maybe just talk this through a bit? Is this going to be an issue as you prep for the case? Have you begun discussions with stakeholders ahead of this filing? Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nShar, there's always conversations about those matters as we go through those proceedings, and so I would not be surprised. We always have good deliberations about those issues in terms of where we are and recognizing the level of service that we provide and the premium nature of how we run this business. Equity ratio also came from a tax reform issue, not just from Vogtle. There are a lot of implications. As usual, as we go through 2025, all of these issues, I think, will be thoroughly vetted and thoroughly debated, once again, as I said, recognizing how we perform as a company.\n\nShar Pourezza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYeah. Got it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThe equity ratio changes were broad-based. This is not just a Georgia conversation. It was in all of our states. Chris made the point. That was for tax reform. It was coincidentally during the construction of Vogtle, but had nothing to do with Vogtle construction itself. Unless there's some major change to the tax policy that has implications, I think defending that is where we will start from.\n\nShar Pourezza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you so much, Dan and Chris. We'll see you soon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar. I hope too.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAre you there, Julien?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Oh, hey. How are you guys doing? Sorry, I was on mute there.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Julien. How are you, man? How are you?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood. Good, good. Pleasure, guys. I'm absolutely doing well. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, congratulations on your child.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. It's been a busy month, all right. I got to tell you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHope you're getting some sleep.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOne of these days. Seriously. Getting this lunch done. Look, speaking of having the sun shining, you guys are starting the year off pretty well. It's nice to see. Maybe to turn that into a specific question, you've got this $1.30 out there. Just to kick it off, you've probably seen some continuation of that good weather from Q2 into Q3. Is that already reflected in that $1.30, or is there some more upside there? Because you already had $0.10 versus normal in the second quarter.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nWhat we would typically do, Julien, and what we've certainly done in this case, is put out a quarterly estimate that is weather normal. There's always still at least two months left in the quarter when we put these out. Just anecdotally, I would say, I think this is the first day in about three weeks that it hasn't rained here in Atlanta. I'm not so sure that July has looked like June did.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nSounds like Texas, as far as rain goes. Anyway, just to keep going on that, in terms of the backdrop with the load growth, I just want to make sure I'm hearing you clearly on this, the 17% is phenomenal on the data center load growth. How do you think about that number in terms of the medium and longer term?\nYou've obviously provided some very healthy longer-term load growth numbers. Should we expect that to continue to compound consistently through the period here? To what extent actually could we see an acceleration of that number here? There's a lot of talk about building infrastructure, but you guys are realizing it in a much more tangible way than perhaps some of your peers.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nGreat questions. Let me just clarify the dynamics that are happening. That 17% that we referred to is existing data centers that are on the ground, have been on the ground, and they're either in the process of ramping to their full load, or in some cases, what we believe is also happening is some of these are actually improving the technology in the data centers with not only increasing processing capabilities, but that's also utilizing a little bit more electricity in the process.\nWhat will happen going forward, while this dynamic will be there, this is a small component of our overall commercial sales today. Everything we've been talking about in terms of what drives that 6% sales growth from 2025 to 2028, 9% at Georgia Power, those are new data centers. It will be a significant acceleration that begins to happen in the 2026, 2027, 2028 timeframe and beyond as these data centers are completed. They, too, will have their own ramp-ups to the point where overall commercial sales growth implicit in that 6% will be in the double digits.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nRight. The point is, while 17% looks phenomenal off the existing base, that acceleration will obviously accentuate in 2026 already. We should see continued ramping of the existing base in 2025.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nIt will become a big [inaudible].\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. All right, guys. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAll right, guys. Thank you, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking my question. Good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat commentary here just on the load growth that you're seeing in data center commentary. Are you tracking ahead of that 6% assumption? I feel like things are pretty fluid and moving quickly. Are there indications that it could be stronger from here?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI think given how the pipeline is evolving, there are indications the long term could certainly be stronger. Again, we're talking into the decade, into the 2030s. The way that is building the momentum is very promising in terms of the very near term, David, like the 17% we were just talking about. Even if that swung a little bit, it's such a small piece today. It's not going to have a meaningful impact on current results. It really is about the capital being deployed in the big hyperscale data centers that are due to be online a little bit in here in a few years.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep. Got it. That makes sense. I was thinking about the load growth overall. Let's see. The other item I just wanted to check on, there was a valve issue at Vogtle 3 recently. Just wondering if you had any feedback on that, the extent of that issue, and anything else to watch for there.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. No, they worked through that issue, and the unit is now back online. Vogtle 3 has operated more than 98% of its capacity factor over the period. Those things will happen with new units, but we're very pleased with the performance of Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I'll leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Hi, Chris. First, just wanted to clarify on the data centers. So I think on the Q1 call, you gave a number of pipeline of 21 GW, firm commitment of 6.2 GW by the mid-2030s. Does that sound right? What are those numbers now?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nSure. I'm going to even take it a little bit further back, Steve, because I think the progression here is important. You mentioned the 21 GW. That was where we were as of our last call. That's compared to 17 GW back when we originally filed the 2023 IRP update at Georgia Power. It had grown 4,000 GW. As we sit here today, that 21 GW is 24.3 GW in terms of the total pipeline. You mentioned the commitments. The commitments were a significant change from the original filing last quarter. It went from 3.6 GW to 6.2 GW. From the last earnings call to today, that 6.2 GW is now 7.3 GW.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. Then totally separate question. On Kinder Morgan's call, they mentioned expanding the Sonat system with $3 billion growth investment, and kind of, I think, implied that you would represent half of it. Could you just talk to your thoughts on that and likelihood you'll do that?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Look, it's really early for that. Yes, we're a 50% partner on Southern Natural. There is a project that is proposed that total capital is $3 billion. Our share would be $1.5 billion. It's just really early days. You know how these projects evolve. Look, we're very encouraged by it. It's 90%+ , I believe, brownfield, existing rights-of-way, a tremendous opportunity there. We will, at the right time, down the road, once this thing has solidified a little bit more, there's some traction from a FERC perspective in terms of approval, reflect that more in our outlook. All that said, it's an encouraging opportunity.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSteve, the only thing I would add, I think Dan said it, but it's just very early on in that process. I think there's a great deal of diligence to be done. I think at this point in time, the thing to note is that it's just very early on in that consideration.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Last question. Yeah.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI was just going to say, just policy-wise, we're excited about it. To the extent that we can get this done, it's important for everything else that's happening. To the extent that all this large load is down the road, has the opportunity to be served with more gas, capacity like this is really important. We're super supportive of it.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Steve, let me add one more thing on that. We talk a lot about the importance of this country building infrastructure. These kinds of things need to happen to support this economy going forward. For us, it's just very early on. It's some things that this country must embrace and must move forward on.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. One last question, just going back to my first topic on data centers. Can you just remind me how you define firm commitments relative to pipeline for data centers?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. The commitment we're characterizing is essentially a signed request for service within our service territory. It's a commitment by the customer to be at a particular level, a commitment by us to provide the service. A lot of these commitments have further papering, if you will, that goes beyond those kind of key elements where it's commitments for local infrastructure, commitments around pricing, and commitments around the ramp. There's clearly different stages here.\nI think importantly, because we argue with ourselves, what is the right nomenclature for this? What's the right word to really characterize this? Commitment sounds like something that's completely fixed and unreversible. The reality is we have these commitments, these requests for services, and over time, there's puts and takes. In fact, in the numbers I shared with you a few minutes ago, Steve, there were puts and takes in there. Net-net, the megawatts are still going up.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSteve, last earnings call, we went through this orderly process that we go through internal in terms of confirming that this load is, in fact, real. If you remember some of that, that's the discipline in which we look at these projects to make sure they are real, that they've demonstrated a commitment to the state, that they've selected our utility companies.\nIt's a very orderly and disciplined process that we go through. We've been in this economic development business for a very, very long time. We're in the market each and every day engaging with customers. We know how this plays out. We know how it works. For us, as well as for them, it's important to understand what's real and what it means to have a commitment. We spend a lot of time working on this.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nImportantly, last thing, Steve, just to clarify, commitment for us does not mean a center forecast. There's further risk adjustment from there. We know that things will get delayed. We know that the actual peak load alluded to may not show up to that extent, but there'll be load, but not that much. We're risk-adjusting beyond this commitment level to be as conservative, but also as pragmatic as we can with the forecast.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nLastly, the 9% Georgia Power growth rate, that was based off of the initial numbers that you gave at the end of 2023 or when you made the filing?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nCorrect.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, so these updates.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYes. There is potential for those to evolve. I think that's what we will see where we are at the time of the 2025 IRP filing.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Thank you, Steve.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks. Hope everyone's doing well.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI hope you are.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nI am. I am. It's hot. Hey, a lot of questions have been answered. I know that there's been potential for DOE loans to enter the portfolio, and hopefully that's coming up soon, but can you just remind us how that could affect your overall financing plans and what could maybe be on the table, if anything?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nSure, Nick. Happy to. Look, we believe, and the devil will be in the details as we work through this process with the DOE loan office. There could be big round numbers, eligible capital in the range of $15 billion-20 billion over the next, I don't know, seven, eight years or so that could qualify for this. The program allows that qualified capital to be financed up to 80% of the qualifying amount. That's a significant amount of debt financing that could be done through a very low-cost source relative to the capital markets.\nImplication of that is a potential tremendous benefit to customers over time, not unlike what we had with Vogtle 3 and 4 in terms of the loan program there. Again, this program could potentially be three to four times the size of the Vogtle 3 and 4 program, which created tremendous savings for customers.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, I appreciate that. Maybe just one conceptual question here. We've heard about economic development on your call, on all of your peers' calls. This earnings season, the tailwinds continue to be very strong. I can't help but notice that some economic and industrial indicators are now starting to roll. ISM indicators this morning were at their lowest since the pandemic. My question is just what's differentiating your service territory, you think, on the economic development side? Is this all chalking up to maybe you guys being conservative in this five-to-seven outlook and waiting for it to come? Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo, and we talked about it earlier on this call about the reliability and the performance of our company, the cost of living in the territory, the transportation hubs, access, and resources that we have here, the business climate. Alabama was recently recognized by CNBC as a top state to do business in. The great advancements there. I think a collection of things that are occurring across this southeastern territory has been attractive for a long period of time and continues to make this part of the country very attractive.\nI think we have a lot of good things going for us. We're excited about where we are. It shows up in the pipeline of business and the projects that are currently in the queue in all of our states, all of our southeastern states. I think it speaks well for the characteristics of our state and where we are. Also, I think our vertically integrated model also supports this is a good place to come and do business.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for those thoughts.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Nick.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, Dan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Dan, as we think about your forward-looking guidance and your 2024 base, you've obviously started the year phenomenally. Year-to-date is materially above the plan, but there are some one-timers in there like weather. As we think about our models and 2026, 2027 EPS estimates and beyond, when you rebate or whenever you provide this guidance at Q4, are you going to exclude these one-time benefits in 2024? I'm just trying to think of what should be the base of the new five to seven, if you will.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. The base for the five to seven is the current guidance in 2024, $3.95-4.05. You mentioned weather as an example, Durgesh. You heard us describe the notion of fixing the roof while the sun is shining, advancing maintenance out of future years in this year. If you looked back over the course of time at our O&M spend, while on average, it's probably flattish to down over time, year-to-year, it's more of a sine wave.\nAgain, what we're doing is managing the short term, taking advantage of opportunities like warmer than normal summers, colder than normal winters, such that in other years where we have milder weather, 2023 being a great example, we have the flexibility to spend less. We're managing to a regular, predictable, sustainable result year in and year out, despite what might be characterized as one-time things.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry. There was some background noise there. I get it. Thank you very much. Just one quick follow-up on credit metrics and debt. I think this year, and this is from the Q1 call, I believe, but you were trending towards 14% by the end of this year and then 16-17% by the end of the planning period in 2028. Does that outlook get strengthened here given the year-to-date outperformance as we think about the end of 2024?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI think we are where we were. You heard Chris and I allude to maybe being disappointed if we're not in the top half of the range. Maybe there's some incremental benefit for 2024, but I think in terms of the trajectory we're on, we are exactly where we were and how you described it.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thanks again for giving me time.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. You bet.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust wanted to come back to the Sonat expansion if I could and the open season. Was just wondering if you're able to share any color on shipper interest there and whether that was largely for Southern or there were others that came in with good demand there.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nJeremy, I think it's very premature. We have no insider perspective on that at this time. It's just very early in the process.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Fair enough. Just wondering, as you sit back today, how you think about the current business mix in jurisdictional exposure as the electric backdrop is changing for load growth. Is there any rotation of assets that you might be interested in here?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I don't think we're there. We love the portfolio we have. We've done a lot of work over the years to hone it to the portfolio it is today. We've got great electric and gas jurisdictions at large. We've got great complements with Southern Power. No, there's certainly no designs on anything like that as we sit here today.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Fair enough. Thank you very much.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar Incorporated. Please proceed.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nHi there. Back to the data center conversation. As you go through those numbers and you talked about risk adjusting and all of that, what are the regulatory hurdles, the state regulatory hurdles that you face in terms of thinking about that risk adjustment and some of those numbers actually coming to fruition?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nOnce again, Travis, as we go back to a pretty detailed conversation we had on our last call, it's also going to the commissions to confirm the reality of the projects, understanding what the risks are, understanding the pricing that needs to take place that makes sure that we are working with these customers to really fully load, understand what their incremental costs are and their marginal costs are, and how we price that so that also when we do this, we're providing benefits to the rest of the customers in terms of what sometimes we refer to as downward pressure.\nJust as we work to confirm reality and commitments, but also then do risk adjusting, having that same process and conversation with the regulatory jurisdictions in terms of understanding the reality and then understanding the financial and pricing implications. One of the things that I feel real good about is this orderly process that we have to work through this with the commissions, but also the ability to work through this with the respective customers.\nI just feel real good about our process to give order to sometimes what looks like a lot of chaos in this marketplace. I think we have the experience, we have the wherewithal, we have these constructive regulatory environments, and we have the framework to do this, I think, in a way that makes sure that it's orderly and disciplined and provides benefits to all stakeholders.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nSure. Do each of those contracts need official regulatory sign-off, or can you negotiate those without state regulatory sign-off?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. We can negotiate that without regulatory approval.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Very good. Real quick, what's the long-term planning process timing in Alabama and Mississippi in terms of when we might get more information on data center load or total CNI load growth there?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYou'll see those conversations, I think, on a regular basis, annually. It's a little different than what happens in Georgia. As they look at their plans and look at the issues and needs that show up, they'll take that to the commissions for certification.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?w\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo. Again, thanks everybody for taking time to be with us. We feel good about where we are as a company and how we're performing and executing. We're incredibly excited about the future. Thanks for being with us today, and be safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Robert, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Q1 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Rob. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such an exciting time for our company. Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 4 successfully achieved commercial operation. Units 3 and 4 are now delivering more than 2,200MW of reliable, 24/7 carbon-free energy and are designed to do so for decades to come. With all four units operational, the Vogtle site is now the largest generator of clean energy in the country. I cannot be prouder of our team's perseverance and commitment to getting Vogtle Units 3 and 4 completed with the standard of quality clearly demonstrated by Unit 3's performance since it reached in-service last July.\nAlong with our own team, success on this historic project required the hard work and dedication of tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers, a committed group of co-owners and regulators who had the courage to support nuclear when others did not. While it was not our mission when we embarked on this project, and while it was at times an arduous journey, we have proven that nuclear is achievable in the US. With ever-increasing demands for carbon-free energy and the burgeoning demand for reliable 24/7 energy to support our digital economy and society, we believe our country will need more nuclear energy. So the importance of this project for Georgia and our nation cannot be understated. This is what history, this is what making history looks like.\nThese are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the US in over 30 years, and we are proud to be the company that saw it through. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the Q1 of 2024, our adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share, $0.24 higher than the Q1 of 2023, and $0.13 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were investments in our state-regulated utilities and weather that was less mild for our electric utilities than in the Q1 of 2023. This is somewhat offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. All our businesses experienced a strong start for 2024, driving our results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share. While there were several factors for this performance versus our estimate, one worth highlighting is the higher-than-expected weather-adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class.\nThis was driven by a combination of our strong local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to last year. Overall, weather-normalized retail electric sales to all classes were 1.7% higher than the Q1 of 2023. Industrial sales are beginning to show signs of recovery following a soft 2023, with year-to-date increases led by the lumber and paper industries. The Southeast regional labor supply remains above pre-pandemic levels. Employment growth is strong, and unemployment is low, averaging approximately 3% across our regulated electric jurisdictions. A favorable business climate and increased expansion of manufacturing is attracting new households to the Southeast, driving continued net in-migration and customer growth. Before turning the call back over to Chris, I'd like to highlight our most recent dividend increase.\nLast week, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved a $0.08 per share increase in our annual common dividend, raising the annualized rate to $2.88 per share. This action marks the 23rd consecutive increase, and this will now be 77 consecutive years, dating all the way back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record remains an important part of Southern Company's value proposition. In one quick note, our adjusted EPS estimate for Q2 is $0.90 per share. Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Our system performed extremely well, and that's a testament to our team's collective commitment to serving customers reliably across our business, especially as we meet the demands of the extraordinary growth that we're seeing. Particularly within our Southeast footprint, we continue to see strong economic development activity, with Q1 investment announcements representing the second-highest Q1 on record as our teams continue to work closely with our states and local development authorities to attract new businesses. This growth continues to reflect a diverse mix of sectors, with recent announcements including automotive suppliers, flooring and glass manufacturers, data centers, and mixed-use developments. During our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is accelerating to a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth rate is approximately 9% over this same period.\nAs we look ahead, we're encouraged to see the signs of incremental growth also materializing in Alabama and Mississippi. A little more than two weeks ago, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission staff, and multiple intervenors in the 2023 IRP update docket. This approval affirms the need to quickly procure and deploy several thousand MW of resources to serve customers' rapidly growing projected electricity demands by the winter of 2026 and 2027. Georgia Power was also authorized to build and own a balanced collection of resources, including new natural gas combustion turbines and battery energy storage systems, while also providing for an accelerated RFP process for incremental battery energy storage systems.\nThe constructiveness and timeliness of decisions like this are a testament to the quality of our Southeastern state's regulatory environment and our ability to meet the projected rapid demand growth garnering headlines across the country. Coinciding with Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update filing last fall and the release of our sales forecast in February, external attention, including from the investment community, has focused on several key questions. How do you know the load in your forecast is real? How do you know you're pricing this new load appropriately? And what protections are in place if the forecasted load does not materialize? Those are all very important questions, and the answers are all fundamental to how Southern Company has run our electric utilities for a very, very, very long time. We'll address each one of those questions in just a moment.\nFirst, I want to share with you what we believe are the four key characteristics required to successfully navigate this tremendous growth opportunity. We believe Southern Company is positioned as well or better than any utility company in the country on these four fronts. First, it requires supportive states and constructive regulation. Our states continue to be great economic development partners, and they have advanced economic policies that support healthy growth. When it comes to utility regulation, our states are among the best in the country at balancing the needs of customers while helping ensure utilities provide real value to customers in the form of clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy. Second, it requires institutional wherewithal. We have vast expertise and experience deploying energy infrastructure. We've been investing billions to improve the resilience of our electric and gas transmission and distribution networks.\nIn recent years, across our subsidiaries and across the country, we've built thousands of MW of energy supply in the form of new solar, wind, and battery facilities, advanced microgrids, a state-of-the-art combined cycle natural gas plant, and the only new nuclear units built in this country in more than a generation. These new assets, along with the existing electric and gas infrastructure we operate, have served customers with a superior measure of reliability and resilience. We have the people, we have the experience, and we have the scale to be successful. The third requirement is a flexible pricing framework. Our electric utilities, working with existing customers approved by their respective public service commissions, have a history of being able to price new large load projects appropriately even in periods of high demand and challenging market conditions. These frameworks are designed to benefit all customers.\nFor example, Georgia Power's real-time pricing rate, or RTP, which was pioneered decades ago, allows for the flexibility to price individual customers based on their unique load profile and risk characteristics. Finally, success in this environment requires experience and discipline. Experience understanding utility economics and the true marginal cost to serve new customers. Experience identifying and mitigating the risk inherent in new or expanding large load customers. Experience in competing for new load with an objective of capturing tangible economic benefit for customers and states. Our experience, combined with the robust models and tools we employ, are partially a product of the competitive economic environment we've navigated in the Southeast for decades. For example, in Georgia, most new large load customers can choose their electricity supplier. Over the years, we've been the chosen provider more often than not.\nHowever, it's the load we did not win or perhaps did not even choose to compete for that reflects our discipline and experience. By offering prices designed to recover the marginal cost to serve new loads, we seek to protect all other customers and, importantly, maintain our credibility with our regulators and state policymakers. I'll now turn back to Dan to address those three key stakeholder questions pertaining to this extraordinary growth opportunity.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris. So how do we know the load in our forecast is real? The short answer is that we've already incorporated risk adjustments to the forecast. One could argue it's a conservative view. We would say our forecasts are informed by our experience and by our continuous engagement with prospective, new, and existing customers. We've included a visual representation of our process in the slide deck. Typically, our forecast appropriately represents only a portion of the full potential load we might ultimately serve. If a customer has not formally communicated state-specific project details with our company, they're not included in the forecast. If they have a choice of utility provider within the state that they have chosen, which is the case in each of our states, they are either not included or only included at a reduced probability-weighted level.\nImportantly, even once a customer has committed to one of our utilities, we further risk-adjust the forecast based on the likelihood of delays on the customer side, whether those are construction delays or delays in ramping up production. Lastly, we further risk-adjust the forecast based on a history of announced loads being higher than actual customer loads. Lower actual customer loads often result from technology improvements, economic conditions, or other factors. All of that to say, we believe our forecast is the best representation of expected future demand. With the potential for additional new customers to choose our states and utilities, there is potential for our forecast to be higher down the road. Next, I'll discuss pricing. When it comes to knowing that we're pricing this load appropriately with a view toward protecting existing customers, several of the factors Chris mentioned a moment ago are key.\nWe use our experience and robust tools to ascertain the expected marginal cost to serve each new customer and incorporate that into our flexible pricing mechanisms. We price the load in a manner that helps ensure the marginal cost will be borne by the new customer. Sometimes, as is the case with Georgia Power's recent growth, we're able to provide new large load customers with competitive market pricing that also provides meaningful benefits back to existing customers. These benefits are not only driven by carefully constructed market pricing. They're also a function of a robust, long-term integrated resource planning process and Georgia Power's ability to use existing resources to serve a large portion of the new demand while only needing to incrementally invest to meet higher peak demands.\nThe stipulation the Georgia PSC recently approved includes a commitment by Georgia Power for these customer benefits to be incorporated into the 2025 rate case. Our approach to pricing has never been more important given the current macroeconomic backdrop. Affordability is a key tenet of our customer-centric business model, and we work hard to ensure new customer demands don't place additional burdens on those less able to afford it. Lastly, the risk question: what protections are in place if our forecasted load does not materialize? I've already described how we've risk-adjusted the forecast itself. The other major risk mitigations pertain to local infrastructure improvements and our portfolio of supply resources. These new large load customers often require significant local distribution system improvements, and these improvements often provide limited incremental benefit to other customers.\nAs a result, we require most new large load customers to pay for these improvements upfront, helping ensure other customers are protected. When it comes to supply resources, the risk mitigation comes in the form of the diversity of our resources. Purchased resources, or PPAs, can expire without being renewed. Older owned resources, which might require additional investments or higher maintenance O&M spend to remain available over the long term, can be retired earlier. Decisions and risk strategies like these are a key aspect of the multi-year integrated resource planning processes in each of our states. With robust long-term planning comes optionality in future decision-making. Said differently, planning for 20 years of resource needs every three years helps ensure that customers benefit from a flexible resource plan that is equally focused on reliability and affordability. Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you to wrap up our prepared remarks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to first take a moment to reinforce that as we serve these growing energy needs, we also remain focused on achieving our long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals, including net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Working closely with each of our states and with an unrelenting focus on safely and reliably serving our customers' needs, we continue to make responsible economic resource decisions over the long term. For example, over 80% of the resources additions planned across our system, totaling nearly 10,000MW from 2023 to 2030, are zero carbon-emitting resources. We have accomplished some wonderful things in recent weeks, and we are even more excited about our future. We have seven quality state-regulated utilities with long track records of outstanding operational and financial performance that deliver over 90% of our earnings.\nAlong with a few quality complementary businesses, we believe we have the ideal portfolio to support our long-term objectives. Southern Company's value proposition has never been more attractive. Our team has never been stronger, and we are positioned as well as we ever have been. As I said earlier, we have the people, the experience, and the scale for sustained long-term success. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Southern Company. Robert, we're now ready to take questions.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nAt this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much.\nHey, how's it going? Thanks so much for taking the questions today.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood to see the strong sales growth coming in during the quarter. I guess just as we think about the impact to earnings from some of these volumes, are there any sensitivities that you can provide around the commercial load or the data center load specifically there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, absolutely. So just big as a bread box. So it's roughly, if you think about our total sales, kind of the average price, you're talking about $40 million for a 1% change in our overall sales. Now, for the vast majority of what's showing up here, whether it's data centers, some of these other large load industrial customers, it may skew slightly below that. So really, it's somewhere in a range of $20 to 40 million for 1% change in sales.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's super helpful. Thank you.\nAnd then, I guess just as a follow-up, as you think about the recent commission approvals on the 2023 Georgia IRP filing, do you see any incremental capital needed relative to what you previously laid out on the Q4 call?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nSo there will be some additions based on the approval, Carly, and that largely pertains to the additional storage resources, the battery energy storage system. If you recall, what we included was two very specific projects in our outlook, but the commission actually approved 500MW of owned storage, which is a little more than double what we had assumed. Total dollars is going to. I'm going to give you a big range. I'm going to throw in here, if you didn't see, we also announced an expansion of one of our solar projects at Southern Power. All told, you're somewhere above $500 million, a little south of $1 billion, probably. What we'll do, we don't want to get. We don't want to get too far ahead of the regulatory processes.\nThere's specific certification processes to go through, so we'll let all that play out and then update our forecast more formally later on.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood. Thanks so much for the color.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet, Carly.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, can you hear me?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYes, Steve, we can hear you.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, great. Okay. Well, first, congrats on getting Vogtle fully up and running.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nWell, that's great. I guess just, I know on the last call, you talked to the better sales growth, and you raised the CapEx, and now there's a little bit more potential to come. And that kind of reaffirms squarely in the 5% to 7%. I know you're a big company, and obviously, it's a lot to move the needle of the 5% to 7%. But just, is it fair to say that as you are adding this capital, that at least within this range of 5% to 7%, there's some benefits of adding the capital even net of financing?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, look, I think it's fair to characterize that everything that is occurring, and particularly if the momentum continues in what we're seeing, I would characterize that as adding an upward bias to where we are from an earnings perspective. And you kind of said it, Steve, and we certainly saw your commentary and your note yesterday. We are a big company. We are issuing equity. But even with all of that, these incremental investments should have an accretive effect. But I think it's just too soon to say exactly what that means. But an upward bias absolutely exists, particularly if this momentum continues. Now, does that mean changing growth rate? Probably not. Does it mean maybe that growth rate is off of some higher number later down the road? Probably so.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd Steve, the only thing I'd add is we talked before about not just about raising growth rates, but it's about the durability and the length, how we extend the runway is something that we are keenly focused on, as we've talked to you many times about. And I think that's clearly an opportunity that we are afforded by this added growth.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAnd then the only thing I'd add is also the thing that we are really gratified to see as part of this whole dynamic is a de-risking of our outlook. Because of these customer benefits, the affordability equation is greatly improved, and that's a good thing for the long-term sustainability of our business.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd Steve, the only thing I'd add, I mean, one of the things that we talked about in our prepared remarks, and we've talked to you more about how do we use this opportunity to make sure we put downward pressure on rates across our customer classes and making sure that we price this new load in the right way. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that and having the resources and tools to do that going forward. So it provides us additional excitement for us as we go forward.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. No, that's all helpful. And then just a different topic. Just on, I think we should go back to the last call. Since then, we've had, I think, a bill on the commissioner status. I don't know if we've had an update on kind of the election court cases. And then there was that bill about bringing back the consumer council there. Just can you update us on all those developments?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, the consumer council, consumer advocacy group inside the commission, that bill was not passed by the legislature. The legislature did pass a bill that provided what I think is some certainty around the election cycle going forward for the commissioners. I mean, there was some confusion, chaos, and time and schedule got a little short because of the court cases. So as a result, the legislature did pass a bill that laid out the order and schedule of elections for commissioners between 2025 and 2028. So the thing about that that I think is very instructive is that the current commission in Georgia will be the commission that will sit to review Georgia Power's 2025 IRP as well as Georgia 2025 rate case. So there is order and schedule for the commission for the next two to three years out to 2028.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And then just the last question going back to the data center update, which was very helpful. Just, we're hearing from a lot of other utilities about data center growth that they're seeing. And obviously, you're kind of somewhat at the forefront of that. But just, you mentioned some cases taking deposits or taking money to kind of lock that in or that the customers have to pay upfront. But just how are you trying to assess the risk of some of the customers putting themselves in line in six different regions and then in the end only picking two of them and just making sure that you're not on the losing end of that or just trying to kind of put that into your assessment of risk?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Steve, I think that's what we tried to capture a little bit in what we laid out in, I guess, slide 11 in our deck. We're not counting on those that could potentially still be trying to put multiple states or utilities on the hook. Really, until we have a pretty firm line of sight and that bilateral conversation and commitment between them and our utilities, it's really not solidly in there. There may be some degree of risk-adjusted or kind of probability-weighted aspect just because there's so much activity out there. But we feel pretty good about, again, I hate to use the word, but I think our forecast is fairly conservative in that regard.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. No, that's helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, Chris. Dan, just a follow-up from Steve's question. Just can you elaborate a little bit on the timing of sort of any guidance updates around that sort of that quote-unquote upside bias you just kind of referenced? I guess what's the trigger event, whether you guide to the top and rebase higher and grow 5 to 7 off of that? I guess I'm just trying to figure out what would move that needle. What's the event?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. So importantly, Shar, the way I characterize that is that's if we continue to see this momentum, right? So it's certainly not the cards we have today. The cards we have today have greatly improved our overall profile. It's added that durability. It's massively de-risked kind of the outlook. But it's going to take continued momentum on this front, more investment, more sales growth over the long term. And then just in the disciplined way we do, we're not going to make updates like that kind of entry year, right? I mean, to the extent there's an update to be provided, it's going to be in our Q4 call, and it's going to have to be with as big a company as we are, a pretty significant needle-moving event within the profile.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. That's perfect. And then, Chris, maybe just a quick one for you. There's been obviously kind of a debate in the industry around sort of the behind-the-meter and in front-of-the-meter. And language from some of the hyperscalers seem to show a little bit of a preference around self-generation and self-supply with some backup capacity, which can obviously impact some of the demand numbers as we're thinking about things more prospectively, right? I guess, Chris, I guess what conversations are you having around this as you kind of engage with new customers? Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nShar, I'd say we're having a lot of conversations that cover all of those options and all of those considerations. I mean, I think as you talk to these hyperscalers, these data centers, one, they want the power. They want resilience. They want the reliability. Some of them want clean. And they recognize the demand that they're putting on load in certain locations. And so their considerations: do they self-generate? Do they want support from behind the meter? So I think you go across the continuum of options reflects kind of the conversations that we're having with them. One, to understand what their needs are, but also to help them understand our business and how we provide service and how we operate as a company. Yeah, I mean, we're trying to want to serve them as customers.\nBut I think we're also in a period where there's just a lot of instruction and education that's occurring in the marketplace today. And so the thing about our company is with all the complementary subsidiaries that we have in this portfolio, we have the opportunity to support them and help them in multiple different ways. So I think that's another aspect of our portfolio that's pretty exciting as we look at this demand and what's happening in the marketplace today and that we have resources and capabilities to serve them and support them in a number of different ways.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. That's perfect. That's all the questions I had. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. See you soon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, and congrats on Vogtle. Really exciting stuff.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, man.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nYeah, absolutely. So on the sales growth, you kind of talked about things bubbling up in other jurisdictions just outside of Georgia. And can you just kind of remind us what you're assuming there, what's embedded in the plan versus where the upside of those figures could go?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI don't think there's anything embedded in the plan. I think it's about announcements that we see forthcoming. I think there was an announcement today in Alabama of a 200MW facility that Meta just announced. And then you saw also some legislation in Mississippi that was providing incentives for data centers and other hyperscalers to come to Mississippi. So we see it coming, but that activity, those projects are not assumed and not included in the forecast as we talk about it today.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThat's very clear. Then, Dan, just wrapping in that $500 million to $1 billion-dollar figure that you were kind of discussing on the CapEx side. Understand this is outside the plan now and probably not coming to your yearly update. But just how do we think about the credit implications? And I know last quarter, I think you said you were 14% to 15% FFO to debt in 2024 with a 60 basis point improvement every year thereafter. Is that still the way to kind of think about the uplift here over the next few years? Maybe you could comment on that.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, absolutely, Nick. Yeah, that profile we described in the Q4 that kind of ramps from that 14 last year up to 17 in the back half of the plan is absolutely still the profile to watch. As this incremental capital opportunity emerges, what we'll do is issue sufficient equity, probably through something like an ATM and through our plans to kind of restore the metrics to where they would have otherwise been without that incremental CapEx. And again, kind of going back to Steve's question, yes, even doing that, this incremental CapEx will have an accretive effect.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thanks a lot.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\n. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on unit four.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you all.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Durgesh.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAlways good to hear from you.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Chris. Thanks, Dan. So hey, Dan, just, I was curious. In your commentary, you mentioned 12% growth from data center sales growth. Just, can you break that for us? How much of that is new data centers versus is that or is it just existing data centers using newer technology?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nSo it's about 3/4 existing data centers, and then a little bit the other 1/4 kind of coming from new data centers year-over-year. So we're seeing both. We're seeing a continued ramp-up of new facilities, existing facilities ramping up their usage.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's impressive. Cool. And then just one quick follow-up on the legislative front. I'm not sure if the House Bill 1192 was actually passed and signed into law. And that talks to kind of suspending, I believe, the sales tax exemption on data centers. Maybe can you just address that? Where does that sit and what implications, if any, do you see on the data center growth in Georgia?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that, I mean, it passed and now it's sitting on the governor's desk, and so we're waiting to see what happens there. I think one of the things the governor wants to do is let economic development activities know that Georgia is still open for business. I think that's one of the key factors and considerations that he'll pay attention to as he makes a decision on that bill. But right now, I don't know what will happen, but it's there for him to take action on. We're waiting just like everybody else to see what happens.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's fair. Thanks, Chris and Dan. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Durgesh.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Jeremy.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nCongratulations on Vogtle Unit 4 there. Just wanted to continue with, I guess, the topic is yours. Given the notably higher-than-expected load growth and ongoing data center investment in your service territory, just wondering how you think this impacts, I guess, future generation mix and specifically coal plant retirement dates given what's happening here. Could there be deferrals or just any thoughts on that?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI mean, I think that's a lot to come. I'd add one more factor there. It's the new EPA rules. We saw the suite of announcements that came out of EPA last week, which we are reviewing. Many of the rules we think are impractical in terms of aligning with the kind of demand that we see forthcoming. Also from a technology standpoint, some expectations that they are advocating and putting forward don't align necessarily with reality. So there's a lot of, I think, a lot of issues that are up in the air. At the state level, I think as we look at how we respond to the demand, how we respond to this need, all those considerations must be on the table in terms of new generation, what happens to existing generation, does it get extended, and what happens there.\nAll of that has to be on the table, but we also have to factor in what are the potential new rules from the Environmental Protection Agency. So I would say all of that is very subject to further consideration as we move forward through all the processes that we'll be a part of.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThat makes sense. How do you think about the feasibility of carbon capture in your territories?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGeologically, yeah. I mean, there are places down on the coast, the Mobile area, some parts of Mississippi where we have the geology for sequestration. But once again, I think as you look at what is somewhat predicated in some of these rules and the expectations and what the desires are, is the technology available at a commercial scale to do what they're asking us to do? I think there are a lot of questions there. So I think it's. I go back to these rules. I think they're impractical at this time. And so I think there's more work to be done and more conversation to be had about how they should go forward. But we're still doing the analysis because it's a lot of pages, a lot of work.\nThen we've got to decide what we do going forward in terms of litigation and whether it's with our states, whether it's with the other different associations. There's a lot of work to be done there, a lot more conversations to be had.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And one last one, if I could. Just given nuclear's ability to offer base load that is very suitable for data center and other demand as such, just wondering any updated thoughts on the viability of that technology down the road and how Southern thinks about that. Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI mean, I can give you my speech if you'd like to hear it. I mean, the country is going to need more nuclear. I mean, there's clearly no technology better suited to support demands of this increasingly digital economy and society. And so I think the federal government has got to step in and provide great leadership to incent companies to move in that direction. I'd also say we're going to celebrate what we've done at Vogtle for a very long time before we give any consideration to any more. But we think others, I think, have the opportunity and should really look at this country has to look at new nuclear to go forward to meet this growing demand.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nMakes sense. Thank you for that. I'll leave it there.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, good afternoon.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nYeah, I think that last question was asking you about Vogtle 5 and 6, but I'm not sure. I guess just a quick one. Last month, there was approval, overwhelmingly approved at the Georgia Public Service Commission, the IRP. But just curious, any commentary on some of the language related to rate increases? And you guys have laid out, especially in the slides, great information on how you're navigating the challenges of adding all this infrastructure, but focus on the customer bill. And just if you could tie that to the language on one of the during the approval with maybe no more bill increases.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Anthony, this is Dan. Look, I think largely any commentary you heard was simply focused on affordability and ensuring that the benefits that Georgia Power said were there end up reflected in customer rates. And that's exactly what the stipulation does, is provide that commitment so that when we file the 2025 rate case, one of those moving parts is going to include incorporating those economic benefits for all customers into that calculation.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nGreat. That's all I had. Congrats again.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Anthony.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Angie.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nThank you. Thank you. First, maybe about the Southeast Energy Exchange Market. When it was first created, I thought that was a sign that maybe there's some excess power in your neck of the woods and that you're trying to distribute it to other parts of the Southeast. Now I'm thinking the other way, that maybe there's a way to move some power into Georgia to actually address the load growth. Again, I'm just clearly fishing for any upside potential associated with this newly created power market.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd Angie, I think it is what it is. I mean, it was intended to move around the partners and participants' excess capacity. And so that's what it has been doing. I think it's been very successful, but I don't think it signals anything more than that. I mean, that simply is it's doing what we intended it to do with all the participants, and so we'll continue to utilize that. Now, how does it factor into the additional growth? I mean, we'll step back and look at it, but it doesn't signal anything more than what we intended to be when we made all the filings and got all the approvals.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, and just really to create a more nimble market for those intermittent resources to make sure that customers, wherever it's needed, benefit from that very, very low-cost energy.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nSo in a similar vein here about Southern Power, I understand that it's fully contracted for now. I'm just wondering, when do you have some open capacity there which could potentially benefit from this run-up and forward power curves that we're seeing in other markets? That's number one. Number two is, so when you hear hyperscalers talk about contracting for a supply of power, they do talk about net zero, right? So I'm wondering, is there a way for Southern Power to, for example, participate in these negotiations, for example, plug into the Mississippi power grid, but address the carbon footprint of that supply with building contract-based solar or some other resources that could basically provide the other carbon-free offsets?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, look, so I'll start with the second question first. Look, Southern Power is always going to evaluate opportunities to serve load-serving entities, right? And so to the extent those opportunities present themselves in any of our jurisdictions where it makes sense, we'll evaluate that. And you've seen that happen in the past, particularly in Georgia. On the first question in terms of kind of the portfolio, yeah, look, it's very highly covered the next five years. But if you think about five years out, that's the end of the decade. That's when other resource needs begin to emerge. That's when you start seeing utilities around the Southeast begin to consider how long will their coal assets be on the ground.\nSo I think once you start looking toward the end of the decade and into the 30s, Southern Power will have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of what we're seeing today.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Angie.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Paul.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director, Ladenburg\n\nHey. Congrats on Plant Vogtle. Great seeing both units in commercial operations. So great job there. I guess my first question is on House Bill 1192. If the governor were to sign the bill, would that essentially slow down the addition of data centers in the state of Georgia or put you at a relative or put your state at a relative disadvantage to other states?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nPaul, I mean, I think it's hard to answer that question, but I would think not. But also, I think you have to look at the competitive nature of economic development across states and where does it put Georgia and then what signal does it send. But also, I think it's a big question about resilience and the ability to meet the demands of these customers, not just reliably, but providing them with the resilience they expect and they demand. But I think just straight answer to your question, I think it's probably not, but I think at the same time, it's competitive nature of economic development by states that I think the state would have to evaluate very closely.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director, Ladenburg\n\nAnd then my other question has to do with sort of the tougher EPA rules. If those ultimately were to be adopted, do you need to accelerate the timeframe for coal plant retirements?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd Paul, that's like I said, we're evaluating those rules as we speak today. And I mean, I think there's a lot we've kind of gotten to very quickly on the gas side in terms of capacity factors and the expectations for carbon capture. I mean, I think there's more work for us to do in terms of the coal implications, but at first blush, like I said, I think they're impractical and probably, yeah, would make it more difficult\nto run coal units as well any longer.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director, Ladenburg\n\nGreat. I think that's it for me. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, everybody.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nHi.\nWhat timeframe or cadence do you expect some of these data center companies that are shopping multiple jurisdictions to make a decision? And then in terms of in-development projects, it looks like there were three pending construction at the time of the stipulated agreement testimony. Have those pending construction data centers started construction or any update you could provide on that?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nI don't know that we have the specific construction updates, Ryan, but I would say just in general, this is, I mean, think of it as a continuous kind of waterfall, right? I mean, there are always data centers coming in and exploring and then committing. And so it's an ongoing thing. Yeah. So right now, there's 12 under construction that total about 2,400MW.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay. So that includes one or two that are still pending. Okay. And then, given that continuous nature, the extent that the momentum were to continue to build, is there a timeframe that you may seek to re-engage the updated IRP process or any kind of framework you may apply to assess when additional resources may need to get approval for?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI think we've said before, Georgia has an IRP in 2025. So they'll factor in new requests, new demands, new load during that proceeding. Alabama and Mississippi will make similar decisions in their processes based on the demands and requests that they receive as well.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company",
    "content2": "Coming out of this last process, Ryan, there was a part of the stipulation is that Georgia will kind of keep the staff and commission updated a little more, not real-time, but on a quarterly basis, kind of leading up to the next formal process. That way, everyone kind of has line of sight as to what is emerging.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nBecause it goes back to some of the points we laid out in the prepared remarks. Is this load real? And so I think that quarterly update helps give the commission and the staff the information they need to give confirmation of the reality of this load.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThat next regular filing is scheduled for 25 January 2025, rather. Sorry.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nAnd then last question for me. In terms of the customer preference for our carbon-free resources, any stipulations or any requirements that they're speaking to specifically as they're looking to decide what locations to locate their data centers?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI mean, early on, we saw a lot of requests for 24/7 carbon-free. Of late, we see the request for, \"Do you have power?\" And like I said, we continue to build additional carbon-free resources. And so we'll continue to work with them. But right now, I think there's just a simple desire and request for resources, for energy.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAnd we're very transparent about our own transition plans. And I think that is an opportunity for them to kind of latch on to transitioning along with us.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHello, Travis. Thank you.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nAlso, congrats on Vogtle. I thought it was a very good choice of words, arduous, in your prepared remarks. So appreciate that.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. We chose that word very carefully.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nI figured. On the load forecast and specifically even the Georgia IRP, what does that mean for T&D investment? Is there upside there in addition to the generation upside you talked about?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. So if you remember, Travis, part of our year-end update on the capital plan, I mean, it totaled $5 billion of increased capital. There was a big piece of that that was also transmission. That will continue to be part of the long-term planning discussions we have with our states. Absolutely, as we add new resources, transmission considerations have to take place. Absolutely, as our fleet transitions from its current state to its future state, transmission considerations are part of that. So there will clearly be transmission opportunities along the way here.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAlso, I mean, there's got to be some additional build-out of gas infrastructure as well. I mean, so there's a lot more infrastructure that's got to be built to support the generation resources to meet this demand.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nYep. Sure. Okay. And then can you remind us the Alabama and Mississippi IRP schedules? And then in addition to that, would you expect some similar issues to come up as what came up in Georgia in those states, or is there something different going on there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Well, we don't want to get too far ahead of exactly what it will look like in terms of if there's suddenly this accelerated load. But so the next scheduled processes, we got Mississippi will launch a process in, or they launched a process in April, rather. They're going through that now. And Alabama will have one next spring, 2025.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI think it's, let me close by saying this. Understandably, I mean, Vogtle 3 and 4, the journey that we've been through took a lot of attention from our stakeholders, and it meant fewer conversations focused on our underlying business and the success of our underlying business. The fact is, all along, we continued to execute at a very high level across our portfolio and delivered strong results. Reliability and customer service were outstanding. Investments in critical infrastructure were made in every jurisdiction. We successfully navigated our regulatory processes and received constructive outcomes. Now, as we look ahead and what's next, is this: a continued unrelenting focus on the fundamentals with customers at the center of everything that we do. Serving the growing load we're experiencing is what we were built for, and our model is designed to turn that growth into value for all stakeholders, customers, and investors alike.\nThat is what the employees of Southern Company do. It might sound boring to some, but it's exciting for us. Thank you for spending time with us today, and operator, that's the end of this call. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Q1 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Thank you."

My name is Malika, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Q4 2023 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, 15 February 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Malika. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's Q4 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent securities filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call.\nReconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 was an exceptional year for Southern Company, a year in which we proved once again that we can do extraordinary things, including delivering strong financial results in the face of unprecedented headwinds, and the successful completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, the first newly constructed nuclear unit in the United States in over three decades. Since its 30 July in-service date, Unit 3's performance has exceeded our expectations, delivering over 5 million MWh of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy across Georgia.\nOther noteworthy items for 2023 included constructive resolution of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, resolving all issues of reasonableness, prudence, and cost recovery, successfully completed construction and commissioning for a brand new 720 MW combined cycle plant on schedule and on time at Alabama Power's Plant Berry, acquired two new solar projects at Southern Power, which, once construction is complete, will add an additional 350 MW of carbon-free generation to its portfolio of fully contracted renewable generation,\nContinued progress toward our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, including our interim goal of a 50% reduction versus 2007 levels by 2030, achieving a 49% reduction in 2023, earned the National Accounts Award for Outstanding Customer Engagement by the Edison Electric Institute, and top honors from J.D. Power for residential and business customer satisfaction. Just last week, Southern Company was ranked as the number one most admired electric and gas utility in Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for 2024.\nThese achievements reflect our team's steadfast commitment to keep the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve at the center of everything we do. Throughout 2023, our electric and gas franchises continued to excel at the fundamentals and started this year strong as evidenced through our preparations and execution during January's Winter Storm Heather, when electricity demands reached all-time winter peaks, and Southern Company Gas' system continued reliably serving customers throughout severe weather conditions across its four-state territory.\nOur ability to navigate through such severe weather events further demonstrates how our customers benefit from the combination of outstanding operational performance by each of our utilities and the value of our vertically integrated state-regulated business model. Our state's long-term integrated planning processes, which include adoption of important planning assumptions like a 26% winter reserve margin for our electric utilities, benefit our customers by providing a reliable and resilient mix of energy resources. Before turning the call over to Dan for a financial update, I'd like to provide an update on Plant Vogtle Unit 4.\nWe continue to make meaningful progress toward the completion of Unit 4, with initial criticality achieved yesterday. Initial criticality represents a key step during startup, whereby operators for the first time safely begin the self-sustaining nuclear reaction to create heat for steam production. As we approach the initial sync with the grid, Unit 4 continues with the remaining startup and pre-operational testing activities that precede the declaration of in-service, which is projected in Q2 2024.\nOur 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which Dan will detail shortly, assumes Unit 4 achieves commercial operation in April. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 for 2023, which was the very top of our 2023 guidance range. The primary drivers of our performance compared to 2022 are higher utility revenues, and lower non-fuel O&M expenses and income taxes, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. Mild weather was also a significant headwind, with 2023 marking the mildest year in our history for our electric service territories.\nOur ability to deliver 2023 adjusted results at the very top of guidance is a great testament to our team and to the resilience and strength of our portfolio of companies. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared back to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down 0.4% for 2023 compared to 2022. Strong usage drove commercial sales growth of 1.3% for the year, which was partially offset by lower residential usage, with both commercial and residential sales impacted by the return to the office dynamic.\nWe continue to see robust residential customer growth with the addition of over 46,000 residential electric customers and nearly 27,000 residential gas customers. Since 2020, we've added over 200,000 residential electric customers, which represents the highest four-year total in decades. Industrial sales finished down for the year nearly 2%, largely due to continued slowing in housing and construction-related sectors, as well as lower sales to chemical companies due to outages and long-planned plant closures.\nConsistent with the drivers detailed in Georgia Power's recently filed 2023 Integrated Resource Plan update, economic development in our Southeast service territory remains incredibly strong. Several years of extraordinary success in attracting new and expanding businesses to our states underpins our long-term electricity sales forecast. While electricity sales growth is projected to remain around 1% to 2% for 2024 and 2025, growth from 2025 to 2028 is projected to accelerate to an average of approximately 6% annually, with Georgia Power's total retail electric sales growth projected to be approximately 9% annually over this same period.\nThe magnitude and velocity of this growth are significant drivers for the increased capital investments reflected in our current outlook. This projected growth also represents a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook and benefit customers, as the substantial projected growth in kWh sales from new manufacturing facilities and data centers has the potential to put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. Turning now to our earnings projections for 2024 and beyond, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2024 is $3.95 to $4.05, and our projected long-term adjusted EPS growth rate is 5% to 7% from that range.\nIn early 2021, we provided the investment community with a stable post-Vogtle 3 and 4 construction EPS projection with an initial and reasonably wide 2024 guidance range. It is perhaps the greatest of understatements to say that the world has changed a lot since early 2021. On a macro basis, we've seen significant inflation and higher and then higher-for-longer interest rates, which alone has translated to interest expense for 2024, hundreds of millions of dollars higher than any of us assumed three years ago. Additionally, relative to our projection in early 2021, the projected in-service date for Vogtle 4 moved into 2024 from 2023.\nIn the face of these challenges, we've continued to work extremely hard to grow our business and to create value for investors. Compared to our projections in early 2021, our state-regulated utility rate base for 2024 is projected to be approximately $6 billion higher, while lower O&M expenses and higher sales are projected to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more than previously projected to help maintain affordability and help pay for those investments. We estimated adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share for Q1 2024.\nOur capital investment plan continues to be well over 95% attributable to our state-regulated utility businesses. The current five-year capital investment forecast, totaling $48 billion, reflects a $5 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our forecast a year ago. This 12% increase in capital spending reflects our ongoing efforts to further increase the resiliency of our electric and gas networks and our technology infrastructure. It also partially reflects new resources proposed in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, about 60% of the brick-and-mortar MW proposed.\nWe have maintained our disciplined, measured approach to capital forecasting for our state-regulated utility businesses. Given the magnitude of change in our projected sales growth and the time frame in which new resources are needed to serve higher peak demands, we felt it was appropriate to go ahead and reflect certain new resources in our capital plan. Additionally, our capital investment forecasts tend to grow, especially in the later years, as the visibility into customer additions improves, regulatory processes unfold, compliance obligations evolve, and our long-term integrated system planning is refined.\nWhile the increases in this year's five-year forecast represent an outsized upward adjustment due to the scale and velocity of the projected growth in the near term, we do believe it's reasonable to expect a historical trend of capital increases to continue going forward. On its own, our capital investment forecast of $48 billion supports annualized state-regulated rate-based growth of approximately 6%, providing a solid foundation for our long-term outlook. Any upsides to the capital forecast will simply serve to add durability to an already strong outlook.\nStrong investment-grade credit ratings remain a priority. We continue to believe that in order to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must also have high-quality credit. As we near completion of Vogtle Unit 4, the reduction in major project construction risk and the improvement in our FFO should strengthen and meaningfully improve our credit profile. To help ensure we preserve what we believe will be a positively differentiated profile, we are also turning on our internal equity plans to fund the incremental capital investment at our subsidiaries that I highlighted earlier. These plans typically provide approximately $350 million of new equity annually.\nAdditionally, we'll preserve our financing flexibility and optionality with a continuous focus on preserving and improving shareholder value. For example, we will continue to maintain an at-the-market or ATM plan to partially finance potential additional increases in capital spending at our subsidiaries or potentially to partially refinance callable hybrid securities if we determine doing so preserves or improves our credit and long-term EPS objectives.\nSouthern Company strives to deliver a superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return, and we believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, the growing investments in our premier state-regulated utility franchises, and the priority that we place on strong credit quality and our remarkable dividend history all contribute toward making Southern Company a premier investment. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. We didn't just meet challenges head-on. We rose above them while remaining committed to keeping customers and communities in the center of everything that we do. I am extraordinarily proud of the hard work, the collaboration, the perseverance, and the leadership that our teams showed throughout the year to enable us to achieve these outstanding results.\nHaving a team prepared to rise to such new heights doesn't just happen. For decades, Southern Company has prioritized investing in our people with a focus on positioning our leaders and their teams to provide the exceptional service customers expect, to deliver the innovative solutions needed in an evolving energy landscape, and to support growing the communities we are privileged to serve. As you all know, our company implemented a leadership transition in early 2023. Rather than simply fill a handful of vacant seats, we embraced it as a grand opportunity.\nDuring 2023, we facilitated 75 officer-level changes throughout the company. The changes brought renewed energy and excitement, and more importantly, and intentionally, the movement served to further strengthen what we believe to be the deepest and best bench in the industry. I am excited about the future of this company, and I am excited about our team and its ability to deliver the results all our stakeholders, customers, and investors alike expect from Southern Company. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines, if you would like to register for a question, please press the one followed by the four on your telephone. You will hear a three-tone prompt acknowledge your request. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw your registration, please press the one followed by the three. Once again, as a reminder, you can press one four to ask a question. One moment, please. Our first phone question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Shar. Welcome\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director of Power, Utilities and Alternative Energy, Guggenheim Securities, LLC\n\nHey, Chris and Daniel. Good afternoon. Just quickly on the new guidance that you rolled forward, does the new 2024 estimate range still include a Vogtle charge? So should we be adding back $0.05 or so to grow off the 5% to 7% like you've talked about in the past? And sort of that new 6% rate-based growth estimate now comes with equity. I guess, what's the comfort level of hitting the midpoint of that EPS growth range, which you just reiterated? Thanks.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Shar. I know there's a lot of focus on this. I think we're always fascinated with the precision with which everyone wants to nail all this down. So let's start with the guidance range. Yes, it absolutely includes impacts from Vogtle 4, not only being in 2024 at all, but certainly going into, as we've assumed in the guidance range, April. I mean, if you add all that up, that's $0.08 of incremental impact on 2024 relative to what it would have been if the project was in line in 2023.\nBut we haven't adjusted our range by that full amount by any means. And what we're doing is using the flexibility, not unlike what we did in 2023 with the mildest year ever, to kind of mitigate that. Those are the kind of mitigations and flexibility items that aren't necessarily available every year. You have to maintain the system. You've got to make sure you're prioritizing service to customers. And so that flexibility is limited. We're using it this year, and that will diminish what we have the opportunity to do going forward. But also, I think what's not factored in is a couple of other important nuances.\nWe thought 40 slides was enough, but maybe we needed one more slide to kind of draw how we always think about our guidance range and our growth range. We don't think about the 5% to 7% being off of the midpoint. We've always kind of drawn those trajectories off the top of it and off the bottom of it. So 7% off the top, 5% off the bottom. I think if you do that from this current range, it captures every reasonable estimate that's out there for 2025 and 2026. When it comes to the rate-based growth, look, we were at 6% last year. We just added $5 billion of capital to the plan. We didn't add all the capital that we see as possible.\nThat kind of incremental capital additions opportunity still exists. So yeah, our ability to grow rate-based and yeah, it's mitigated ever so slightly by a fraction of a percent of increased shares over time. Our ability to hit our numbers is as solid as it's ever been.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director of Power, Utilities and Alternative Energy, Guggenheim Securities, LLC\n\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful, Dan. And then just lastly, I know one of your peers has spoken pretty extensively on sort of nuclear PTCs and obviously expects to receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year to fund sort of that capital plan. I guess, does the plan today, do you expect to receive anything material on the nuclear PTC fund? Is it part of any of your credit metrics or funding plans? Thanks.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar. We have not factored any cash flow from nuclear PTCs into our outlook. We've got a terrific plan with an improving FFO to debt metric that's several hundred basis points above any of our threshold over time and frankly improves every year in the forecast that I look at without those nuclear PTCs. Is there the opportunity for us to capture some of those PTCs? We think there very well could be. We're not counting on it. And to the extent we do, we'll flow those to customers in the most practical amount of time possible. And so it's not going to be a factor in kind of how our metrics or earnings look.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director of Power, Utilities and Alternative Energy, Guggenheim Securities, LLC\n\nTerrific. Thank you, guys. Super helpful, Dan. Really. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. You bet.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nYeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, Chris, Dan. So just, I think you've talked about targeting a 17% FFO to debt, which is differentiated. When do you expect you'll be there, let's say, in 2025 when you have first full year of Vogtle bulk units running? Yeah. When do you expect to be there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. So I've always kind of said we'd see a forecast that gets us to 17-ish is the way I've characterized it in the past. So let me tell you where we are as you sit here today. And I think it's still differentiated and a terrific story. And we're doing everything we can to make sure we're being conservative in the way we think about this. So if we just think about Moody's metrics, our actual result for 2023 was 14%. Keep in mind that's before Vogtle 4 is in service. 2024, with Vogtle in service on the timeline, we believe those metrics will improve by more than 100 basis points in 2024.\nThe weight of the incremental capital that we're deploying and the fact that some of this is kind of long-lived construction, you think about building new gas plants in Georgia or other things, there's a bit of regulatory lag that weighs a little bit on credit metrics. And as that resolves itself, cash flow improves. So with the forecast that I see, go from 14 to over 15 in 2024 and about a 50 to 60 basis point improvement every year after that over time. And that's a function of that capital.\nWe're issuing the equity to kind of continue the improvement. And then there's a little bit of impact in the short term for under-recovered fuel, that as that gets collected and the debt goes away, that also kind of adds to that upward trajectory. So in my five-year forecast, we get kind of in that mid-16 towards 17 range. But again, every year in the five years is an improving story and still hundreds of basis points above our thresholds.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks. And my other question, just, I mean, can you just talk to this growth, particularly, I guess, in Georgia, the 9% a year sales growth, which at least seems kind of unprecedented, at least for my lifetime, this.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSteve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nAnd how are you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Go ahead, Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo, go ahead. Go ahead. Finish your question.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nWell, I guess just how are you differentiating kind of proposed growth projects between ones that are in your plan or ones that you're kind of holding back from because you're not sure they're going to happen? And just, is this a conservative risk-adjusted number? Or how should I think about that? How are you doing it?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nBecause it's just so huge.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYes. It is an unprecedented growth that we continue to witness from economic development activities. And so yeah, this is a very conservative look. I mean, we factor in building permits in terms of actual announcements, of ground has been broken. I mean, so we look at not just companies that are looking and making site visits, but there's been some demonstrated commitment that they will, in fact, be building a project in the state.\nSo we go through those thresholds before we make those filings in terms of having some certainty that these projects are, in fact, real. We've just seen unprecedented economic development activity, say, for the past three years. And we continue to have an aggressive pipeline. As we go to the commission for this updated RRP, we just factored in those companies, those businesses that have clearly demonstrated and taken actions that we think that show some firmness in their participation in their operating businesses in the state.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And I'll just add to that that the momentum in that economic development activity has continued even since filing that 2023 RRP update. And so thank goodness we've got a filing in 2025, and we do this periodically. It's going to continue to evolve. There's a lot still lingering out there that, in our conservative nature, we're not counting on yet, but it's not unlikely.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. But Steve, this is a very conservative look as we make these decisions.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nJust one last thing on this, the 9%, since everybody's very focused on data center growth, how much of it is data centers relative to manufacturing or other growth? Yeah.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nData centers represent right now, we think, somewhere around 80% of that emerging load.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Steve. Have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the questions. Hey, how are you? Thank you. Maybe just to start on the new five-year plan, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the assumptions you made around including some of that spend on the incremental resource needs in the Georgia IRP? And then with the commission order sort of expected there in April, how would you think about updating the capital plan if it's necessary after that decision?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Carly, thanks. It's a great question. And I think I alluded to this a few minutes ago. It really is about the velocity and magnitude of this growth that we just kind of characterized for Steve. It's right in front of us. These resources are needed sooner than later. And so we think it was reasonable to kind of break trend for us a little bit and get slightly ahead of regulatory outcome to reflect directionally what's happening. And so just to kind of pull the curtain back a little bit, we were very specific in what we included.\nIf you go back and look at the proposal that Georgia Power put in front of the commission back in the fall, it included a lot of various owned resources. And what we've included in the capital plan is essentially the new combustion turbines. There's three of those. And then two specific storage projects that are kind of located near military bases at Moody Air Force Base and Robins Air Force Base. That leaves hundreds, I think, over 800 MW of storage projects and a small storage of solar kind of not included in there. We will get a decision in April.\nBut again, as a reminder, there's a whole nother process coming in 2025. So there may be a degree of clarity in April. There may be further clarity coming out of the 2025 process. And as those play out, we'll continue to obviously keep the investment community apprised and update our projections accordingly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. That's super helpful. And then maybe just as we think about executing on Vogtle Unit 4, just any insights on kind of the near-term milestones that we might get updates on that we can gauge progress there? And then to the extent that the timeline does slip beyond kind of the April that's embedded into current guidance. Can you talk a little bit about some of the levers that you might have to pull there to sort of offset those impacts?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Carly, let me start by saying, with initial criticality achieved yesterday, we continue to progress through testing and startup. The next major milestone is syncing to the grid, and that could occur later this month. We expect Unit 4 completion during Q2. We take into account the experiences we got from last year with our Unit 3 as we look at moving through Unit 4. And we could have worked through these how we work through these issues that could arise.\nBut we view this as a long-term investment, and we'll make sure we take the time to get it right. But right now, as we look at where we are, we are planning on the unit being online in April, and we think we have a number of weeks of margin to accomplish that objective.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And Carly, I'll speak to the flexibility. I mean, obviously, I mentioned earlier we're kind of already deploying some of that flexibility to address what we expect to be as we sit here today in April in service. Because beyond that, we've laid out it's roughly $0.03 for every month. But that's partially why we have a range, right? I mean, it's a $0.10 range out there. So it could be a function of moving us within the range for the year or, depending on the circumstances as the year plays out, whether it's weather or something else, we might have some greater degree of flexibility. It's just too early in the year to really be that detailed about exactly how that might play out.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Appreciate all that color. Thank you both.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet, Carly.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst on Power, Utilities and Renewables, Bank of America\n\nHey, good afternoon, team. Hey. Pleasure, guys. Thanks so much for the time. Appreciate it. Hey, a couple of quick questions following up on what you guys have said of late. Just on this big number on sales growth, just to clarify, I mean, in your forecast, I know you've got this pending IRP that technically lines up against that sales. Are you seeing an improving ROE in the outlook, or is this really underpinned at this point by just the IRP and to the extent to which the IRP doesn't fully reflect that sales outlook? Is there something more to go as you work through the process? Question one, if you will.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nSo I'm not sure where you're headed with improved ROE.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst on Power, Utilities and Renewables, Bank of America\n\nJust sort of improving returns, from the additional sales, if you will.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nWell, certainly not improving returns from an overall, say, regulated utility perspective. We really view that as the opportunity to kind of put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. I mean, our objective from an ROE perspective is regular, predictable, sustainable. I think you'll continue to see it play out that way. Just to be clear, Julien, on the sales growth that we've laid out here, so this is roughly 6% in the long term for Southern, that 9% number for Georgia Power.\nThis is actually based on a more conservative view than what's in the IRP update because the IRP update had to put some degree of expectation for additional success from an economic development perspective so that we do stay ahead of this from a resource perspective. It's not a huge differential, but what it also kind of reinforces is, as this continues to play out, those numbers have the potential to continue to go up.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst on Power, Utilities and Renewables, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Excellent. And then just pivoting back to the FFO to debt quickly, I mean, this 17% that you guys were talking about once, I mean, is that changed at all just in terms of how you're thinking about pro forma for Vogtle 4 coming on?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nNo. Nothing's changed in terms of what I believe the financial profile supports, which, again, my objectives, I've stated this before. I think our parent company being at BBB+, kind of the A category for all the utilities, I think the profile we see ahead of us fully supports that. The only thing that's changed is a slightly slower ramp-up in those metrics because of the incremental capital that we're deploying. But in terms of where we stand relative to any of our thresholds, it's several hundred basis points above any of those in every year, and every year improves.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst on Power, Utilities and Renewables, Bank of America\n\nWonderful. And then just quickly on the reactor coolant pumps, I know that there was a little bit of talk in the Form 10-K here. What's sort of the status on V4? And then just to the extent to which that there is some root cause impact on some of the other, there's a need to evaluate the adjacent reactor coolant pumps, if you will. I know there's some language in the Form 10-K on it.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYes. And so yeah, we've done all the analysis. We sent the pump back to the manufacturer, and we think we identified the cause of the issue, but a root cause analysis has not been performed yet. But we have tested all the other pumps, and with the new pump, made sure there were not any similar issues. But we think we're in pretty good shape with the pumps as we go forward.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst on Power, Utilities and Renewables, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Okay. So stay tuned on that front. Thank you guys very much. I really appreciate it.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Nick.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector and Lead Analyst on US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nHey. Hey. Good morning or good afternoon, rather. Sorry.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Southern Company\n\nI guess just to follow up on the question that Julien had on the root cause. I think you just mentioned the possibility of having to go look back at Unit 3 pumps in the Form 10-K. And just what's the actual risk in your mind, and when is that no longer going to be an issue?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI guess, I mean, as we have looked at the pump that we sent to the manufacturer, as we identified what we thought the issue was, we think it's not an issue with the other pumps. I mean, we've tested the other pumps. We've assessed the new pump that we installed, and we think we just have a good handle on these pumps. And I think you consider the runtime, I think that provides good color to kind of, I guess, the confidence we have in the pump and what we've identified as the issues, and things we have to do to make sure we don't have similar issues as we go forward.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I think globally, there's 24 of these things running like a champ right now.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector and Lead Analyst on US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nAbsolutely. Yep. That's helpful. Then just on the capital plan and reflecting roughly 60% of the IRP, I know that you kind of get a decision in the first half of this year. So just how do we kind of think about tweaks to the financing plan? Is it just going to be another Q4 update this time next year, or is there a mid-period opportunity in the cards?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nLook, none of these regulatory outcomes will be. They'll all be in the light of day. I think it will be clear what's approved and what's yet to be approved. I kind of laid out what we've included already, which is those combustion turbines and two very specific storage projects. And so I think we'll be able to provide color along the way. We'll certainly do more formal updates every year as we normally do, but I think there'll be interim opportunities.\nAnd the other interim opportunity that will continue to exist is we've remained extremely conservative when it comes to owning any renewables in any of our electric service territories. But we also are very optimistic that that will happen. And as that gets clarity, we'll make sure that that's known as well.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYou'll also see great transparency through this process. I mean, as the commission in Georgia works through the process, I mean, staff is filing testimony today, and they may have a different perspective, but you'll see that process play out, and that leads us to the decision in April by the commission. You've seen these IRP processes before. Those processes will continue as we go forward, and you'll see real-time kind of how it unfolds.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector and Lead Analyst on US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, David.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North American Power and Utilities Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much. Hey, thank you. Let's see. Thinking about that load growth trajectory, is 6% rate-based growth still the right kind of parameter to think about longer term? 6% load growth, 6% rate-based growth, is that enough to kind of handle the system strain, the generation need, just strain on the T&D system over time? Or is there potential upward growth rate pressure on that rate-based growth number as you get into the later years of this decade?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Look, I think, Dave, what we've tried to imply is there certainly is upward potential here. We've remained incredibly conservative and measured in how we forecasted. We're not trying to get too far ahead of any regulatory processes. We'll get these decisions in April. We'll have a 2025 process. We believe there's more economic development activity that is likely to come to fruition. And so given all of that, it is certainly not unreasonable that our capital budget will continue to rise to serve that incremental load. And so there certainly could be upward, using your words, pressure on that rate base.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North American Power and Utilities Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That makes sense. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the rate impacts coming from that load growth. Are these low-priced new commercial customers, when you're thinking about data center and manufacturing customers, such that there's a lot of grid investment that has to be covered by others within the system, or are there opportunities here? It sounded like you kind of see the opposite where you're bringing in a lot of revenue that ends up being downward pressure on the rest of the system. So wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you see rates progressing over time.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. No.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nGo ahead, Chris.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo, we do expect to see rate decreases for our customers with these additional sales and the customer growth that we'll experience. We think that should more than offset the cost of the resources needed to serve. And so affordability is something we pay a lot of attention to. And there are things we do internal, but we think that one of the benefits of this sales growth is having the opportunity to put downward pressure on rates for our customers across the board. And so that's kind of how we see it and how we evaluate each project to make sure that it's, in fact, putting downward pressure on rates.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nIf you think about where probably every utility company was a year ago, one of the greatest risks facing all of us was affordability. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North American Power and Utilities Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thanks for that. Really helpful. Appreciate it.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nHi. Good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nJust wanted to come in, I guess, on the debt funding side if I could start. Understand the Georgia Power debt funding increase driven by the IRP there. But at the whole company, just wondering what's the main contributor to the kind of big step up there of expected debt issuance? It looks like several billion in the 2024 plan now, and I think it was much less than that before. So just kind of curious, I guess, on the whole company debt issuance step-up expectations.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. So in terms of the change kind of plan versus plan, Jeremy, it's largely driven by the CapEx as well, right? I mean, ultimately, the parent company is funding Georgia Power's equity contribution. And while we're financing that partially with new equity through our plans, certainly, it's certainly not all being funded directly with new shares. So there's incremental debt there. And then just the overall magnitude of the parent company issuance is largely driven by maturities. If you look a couple of pages beyond, there's, I think, over $5 billion worth of maturities in the same time period. So the amount that's kind of new money is much smaller.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nGot it. Thanks for that. Just curious if you're able to share any thoughts on the Georgia PSC elections here. Just as far as from what you guys see inside the state for those pending elections, do you expect the ballot and the elections to happen before the November general election, or do you think it all kind of comes in November? Just kind of curious, I guess, how you think timing could shape up there.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI have no idea. I mean, that matter's still in the court system. So we're observers just like you are, but I have no insight into how that's going to play out at this time.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nGot it. Just a quick last one, if I could. You guys are running an RFP process in the Georgia IRP. How do you think Southern Power and Georgia Power stacks up, I guess, in RFP process there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nLook, just in answering that generally, Jeremy, I mean, and we've said this before, the IRA is going to position all of our electric utilities to be much more competitive in these kind of self-build options when it comes to resources. Whether or not it plays out in this particular RFP, or it's a subsequent RFP, or it's a customer-specific siding, those things will happen over time. But it's also likely a function of something later in the plan. So not a 2024, 2025, maybe not even 2026 kind of resource. We're talking really towards the back end of the plan where that becomes a real opportunity.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nDurgesh Copra\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research on Power and Utilities, Evercore\n\nHey, good afternoon, team. Hey. Hey. Good afternoon.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon.\nHey, good afternoon, Chris. Just that, is there a way for us to give us a range? And I understand if you can, but just in terms of the current capital plan, what is fed to the Georgia IRP? What I'm after is, what looks like a successful outcome there as we await the April decision. I'm just trying to see what is baked into the plan and what to look for in that April decision.\nYeah. It's a fair question, Durgesh, but this is where I want to stop short of getting ahead of any regulatory processes here. We've kind of characterized in terms of the MW that we've included that it's roughly 60% of the kind of brick-and-mortar MW that were proposed. And so the best way for me to characterize it without getting ahead of anything is just say that the incremental capital associated with what we didn't include won't be lost in the rounding. It's a pretty meaningful number.\n\nDurgesh Copra\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research on Power and Utilities, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. I appreciate that, Dan. And then, as we think about just along those lines, incremental CapEx upsides, is there a rule of thumb, just again, just for our models, high level, how should we think about it getting financed? You've got some strong load growth, but when we're thinking about higher CapEx, what percentage could be equity financed versus debt? Any sort of guidance there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. I think what we've done with this update is pretty representative of how we think about additional opportunities. So we added $5 billion of capital to this plan. Let's call that $1 billion a year on average. We've added roughly $350 million of equity every year. So that 35% to 40% range is kind of representative of our consolidated equity ratio and represents pretty well what we think is necessary to maintain, if not marginally improve, but really just maintain the credit profile that's already in a really good place.\n\nDurgesh Copra\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research on Power and Utilities, Evercore\n\nVery clear. Thank you so much. Appreciate the time, guys.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Durgesh.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research on US Utilities and Power, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good afternoon. A couple of quick follow-up questions, really. One, just to clarify the equity of $350 million per year. That's through 2026 in the slide. It kind of sounds like you're saying that's through 2028. Should we think of that as just a run rate, $350 million per year going forward, and then potentially more if there's more CapEx?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. So what that $350 million represents is us turning on what we refer to as our internal plan. So it's issuing new shares through our DRIP, through our 401(k), and that's about the run rate. And it just happens to match up pretty well with the needs associated with the $5 billion of incremental capital. We typically also maintain an at-the-market plan as flexibility. And so to the extent there's incremental CapEx that emerges, which, again, is certainly reasonably possible given everything we've described, the ATM's the source that we'll tap into to help finance that.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research on US Utilities and Power, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Very good. Next, on the CapEx update, just to clarify and sorry if I missed it, does that include anything for Alabama Solar, or would that be incremental?\nThat would be incremental. Yeah. Yeah. No, that would be incremental. There's still no new rate-based solar included. So we've remained conservative in terms of our projections there in the outlook. And hey, just going back, Andrew, real quickly to the equity question, just to kind of point out since it maybe it wasn't clear because we only put a three-year financing plan out there. Yeah. Leaving the plans on every year. And on average, kind of the average increase to shares every year is a fraction of a percent. So that's also kind of in the rounding.\nSounds good. One last one, if I may. Dividend growth, you've been very consistent at $0.08 per share, about 3%. Given the CapEx outlook, is there any point in time at which you might reconsider the trajectory?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAnother terrific question. So we had kind of alluded to the possibility of reevaluating the rate of dividend growth once we got Vogtle 4 into service and kind of had we were kind of in a steady state and into the kind of below 70% somewhere. Given our current circumstances where we are in a place of issuing equity, perhaps one of the most efficient sources of equity is to remain modest in the way we continue to increase the dividend. So I think for the foreseeable future, the trajectory we've been on is a reasonable expectation for the trajectory we'll remain on.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research on US Utilities and Power, Scotiabank\n\nVery clear. Thank you so much.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.",
    "content2": "Anthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst on US Energy and Electric Utilities, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, good morning, Chris. Good morning, Dan. If I could just hit you up one quick one on the data centers and I guess the load growth. It seems that we finally are going to get some load growth in the sector, and we're all looking at data centers' help. But it seems that maybe the rate design question we're all trying to figure out, typically a lower-margin customer, large investment requirement. And earlier, you touched on maybe helping with some customer bills. My question is, if you go deeper into that, is there going to be bigger bill impact and bigger fights in rate design, or you don't think that's an issue?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI mean, there's always that, there will always be issues. But I think as we look at increased sales, as we look at growth in customers, and then as we work with these new customers, we think this provides us the opportunity to have downward pressure on rates. And so we will work with many of these customers in terms of their pricing.\nBut once again, I just go back to the fundamentals of increased sales opportunity and this customer growth, how that supports the opportunity for us to put downward pressure all across our customer base to see downward pressure on rates. I mean, we'll evaluate each customer to ensure that, in fact, does happen that they put downward pressure on overall rates across the company.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Anthony, what it appears a lot of these data centers are beginning to do is prioritize reliable, resilient service over many other things. That gives us the opportunity to price it appropriately for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, we'll look at the size, the demand, the timing. There are other factors that will go into making sure that we price service appropriately to those customers.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst on US Energy and Electric Utilities, Mizuho Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYou're welcome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Angie.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you?\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst on US Utilities and Power, Seaport Research Partners\n\nGood morning. Okay. Great. I know that everybody's asking questions about data centers, but I'm just, again, maybe just taking a step back. So when somebody wants to locate a data center in your service territory, do they just get connected to the grid, or do they develop their own power sources? Do you actually see that they, for instance, have some preference for non-emitting resources? Do they use you more as a backup power source? Again, just, again, trying to understand the dynamics of those data centers being added, for instance, in Georgia.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAngie, there are a lot of considerations that go into that decision. And yeah, we want to connect them to our grid. And yeah, we'll have conversations with them about renewable resources and the mix. But those are conversations, yeah, that we do have with them, recognizing what upgrades need to be made on the system, locations where they are. So yeah, there are a lot of kind of really detailed conversations, engineering conversations that go into making those final decisions that also then ultimately impact the pricing for that service.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst on US Utilities and Power, Seaport Research Partners\n\nBut again, it's not self-supply, right? So they use Georgia Power, for example, as a source of power.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAbsolutely. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst on US Utilities and Power, Seaport Research Partners\n\nOkay. And then secondly, again, I know this question has been asked over and over. It's just hard to believe that the load growth is not having a bigger impact on your earnings growth. And again, I don't even imagine this is an emerging market sort of pace of load growth, especially for Georgia in those outer years, and yet there's no impact, again, from our vantage point on your earnings growth. Is it just because the interest expense drag is so pronounced that it absorbs the help that you're getting from higher load growth?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Angie, it's a few things. Certainly, relative to where we were a year ago, and I think we've said this before, in a higher-for-longer environment, certainly interest is a bigger headwind going forward. But the bigger dynamic in your question is around what we're actually investing in to serve this load or why we're investing. So keep in mind the 6% for Southern Company sales growth and 9% for Georgia Power, that's kWh usage. That's the growth in the total kWh used. What we invest to do is serve the peaks. And so that looks a little different than the 24/7. We've got a lot of resources. We just may have to incrementally add resources to serve the peaks.\nAnd that's what you're seeing largely in the capital deployment. And net-net, we're comfortably in that 5% to 7% growth range.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst on US Utilities and Power, Seaport Research Partners\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you doing, Paul?\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co Inc\n\nGreat. And congratulations on a good quarter.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst on Utilities and Clean Energy, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nJust to clarify, if you were not to get sort of the higher growth rate in sales after 2025, would that have an impact or potentially change your 5% to 7% growth target?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nNo.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co Inc\n\nOkay. Great. And then I noticed that the gas capital spending is roughly unchanged. Can you sort of share with us what you're anticipating is going to happen in Illinois? And is there spending that's being shifted from Nicor Gas to any of the other gas subsidiaries?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, I think you got it just right. I mean, we see the opportunities to have some increased capital spending in Atlanta around the operations here in Georgia. We think that allows that gas investments to be stable going forward. I think you've spoken to it just right.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Any changes in Illinois are modest, to be fair. I mean, the outcome there for us, while disappointing, also provided a bit of a roadmap as to how to be successful going forward in navigating that jurisdiction in terms of just the things we've got to make sure we do as we deploy capital. Keep in mind, a huge, vast majority of the capital that's deployed for Nicor Gas is compliance-related. So there's only so much to kind of not do in the first place.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co Inc\n\nGreat. And then my last question, I mean, generally speaking, when we think of EPS growth with respect to rate-based growth, there tends to be dilution to the level of rate-based growth because a portion, or the equity portion, is funded either by parent debt or by parent equity. So can you help us sort of understand at 6% rate-based growth, is it possible for you to achieve, or how would you achieve sort of the high end of your growth target?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Great question, Paul. So again, we were at 6% growth last year in rate base. We've added $5 billion of incremental capital to that. We've kind of characterized it as approximately 6%. But then also the shares we're issuing, I think I mentioned this earlier, that equates to a fraction of a percentage. And it's kind of just in the rounding. We feel very comfortable that net-net, how all these things stack up is a conservative, achievable forecast.\n\nPaul Fremont\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co Inc\n\nGreat. That's it for me. Thank you very much.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nEnergy and Utilities Senior Equity Analyst, Morningstar, Inc\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nEnergy and Utilities Senior Equity Analyst, Morningstar, Inc\n\nYou've answered almost all of my questions. I do want to follow up on that dividend. That was one of my questions. Just to clarify what you said, you would expect the dividend growth to stay below earnings growth for at least a couple of more years. Did I hear that correctly?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Yeah, Travis, you did. And so again, our cadence of growth has been $0.08 per year for several years. I think it's reasonable to expect that to continue. Of course, it's all subject to the board's oversight and approval. But what that will do is take us during this high period of CapEx, which hopefully goes on for a very long period of time, brings us comfortably down into the 60% range from a payout ratio perspective. And so that's a good place to be. And we'll evaluate every year what the forecast looks like and what's appropriate. But right now, I think the reasonable expectation is that continued modest growth, which is just below 3%.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nEnergy and Utilities Senior Equity Analyst, Morningstar, Inc\n\nYep. Okay. Very good. And then obviously, I'll talk about the demand growth. Put another way, what does demand growth mean for operating costs growth? Is there a tight correlation there if you get 6% or whatever percent annual demand growth? Should we also see a similar increase in operating costs, or is there not a link there?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. There's certainly a relationship. I wouldn't call it a correlation, but to the extent we're building a new gas plant, certainly that comes along with incremental O&M. To the extent we're building new transmission distribution lines, there's some maintenance component to that. But that's also part of the cost structure that we're ensuring these new rates and revenues will cover such that the net result is the opportunity to put downward pressure on the existing rates.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nEnergy and Utilities Senior Equity Analyst, Morningstar, Inc\n\nOkay. Got it. Thanks so much. That's all I have.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nUS Utilities & Energy Infrastructure Analyst, Citi Research\n\nHi, everybody.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nRyan Levine\n\nUS Utilities & Energy Infrastructure Analyst, Citi Research\n\nWith Vogtle. Good. How are you? With Vogtle COD targeted for April, freeing up some management attention and the personnel changes that were highlighted. Do you see any meaningful opportunities to reduce O&M spending below the current guidance as time progresses, or are these initiatives tabled given all the opportunity in Georgia by the IRP process?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo. I mean, we're always looking across our hand and finding ways to be more efficient. I mean, so there's ongoing efforts to, once again, as we look at affordability, I mean, we think about the opportunities to drive rates and pricing down because of sales growth and because of customer growth, but also making sure that we focus on looking internal in terms of being more efficient and finding ways to also drive down the cost of our O&M expenses. Also making sure we take full advantage of fuel pricing. I mean, you see where natural gas prices are now.\nSo looking across the entire portfolio, I mean, that is an ongoing continuous exercise that we'll always focus on in terms of finding ways to drive down O&M and find ways to be more efficient.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And just as a nuance, all the costs associated with completing Vogtle 3 and 4 are capital costs. And so those aren't O&M costs that are an opportunity to reduce.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And the last thing I'd add, even though we've had this focus on Vogtle, but it hadn't kept us from paying attention to the fundamentals, to making sure that we provide the service that customers expect, but also being focused on the cost of our product.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nUS Utilities & Energy Infrastructure Analyst, Citi Research\n\nOkay. And then what's the peak hour load growth forecast in Georgia, and how much lower is that than the total kWh growth number that you cited? And as you're looking to execute on this plan, are there any limitations with supply chain that could constrain growth opportunities by the IRP process?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Look, on supply chain, I think we're in terrific shape given our scale. And just we've kind of seen this coming for a little while to the point where we can deploy the resources needed. On your peak question, we'll have to follow up with you on that. Just let's connect with the Investor Relations team and get you an answer there.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nUS Utilities & Energy Infrastructure Analyst, Citi Research\n\nOkay. Well, thanks for taking my questions.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Paul.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nUtilities Analyst, Glenrock Associates LLC\n\nGood afternoon. Hey. Congratulations on these opportunities that you guys have. Just as we expected the data center stuff. I mean, you did indicate in your prepared remarks; it seemed that this was based on actual sort of activity, physical construction activity, etc. Is it correct to assume that these guys, these data centers, etc., have a price in mind at this? I mean, they wouldn't be doing this. I mean, obviously, they're using a large amount of electricity. It's part of the economics of their determination to move, that they know how much they're going to be essentially paying for power if they're doing this, correct?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI think there is a, yes. I mean, they may not know exactly what the price will be. But once again, as we sit with them, understanding their needs, what their desires are, and the level of service, I mean, that all goes into consideration of what the ultimate price will be. I mean, the value, location, reliability, resiliency, all those things go into consideration as we kind of price these projects out. And so that's a part of the negotiation. That's part of the conversation that we have with it.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nUtilities Analyst, Glenrock Associates LLC\n\nOkay. In some jurisdictions, because they have their own backup power, because they have to be there in case there is an outage or something, they have to get approval from regulatory commissions, their respective state regulatory commissions. Is that the case in Georgia?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nNo. I mean, like I said, I mean, we will. I mean, they will.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nUtilities Analyst, Glenrock Associates LLC\n\nYeah.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. There's some customer-sided programs that have been proposed in the IRP, Paul, that those are being evaluated. And those kind of serve the same purpose, but it's not the dynamic that you're describing in those other states.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nUtilities Analyst, Glenrock Associates LLC\n\nOkay. But just roughly speaking, when we're talking about the average data center rate versus the system rate, is there a rule-of-thumb as to where that kind of is? Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, I mean, how much of a percentage of the average system rate for Georgia Power, let's say, would a data center customer be roughly, I mean, just roughly speaking, thinking of getting?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI don't think so. I think we may be better informed as we bring some more projects online. But right now, I don't think that would be the case. And plus, it could be trade secrets as well, so.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nUtilities Analyst, Glenrock Associates LLC\n\nOkay. And then just finally, when we're looking at 2026, 2027, and 2028, and that 9% number, for instance, for Georgia Power, does that go up a lot? In other words, is it kind of, I mean, is 2028 a lot higher than 2026 if you follow what I'm saying? In other words, it's a three-year period. The number jumps up a lot in that period. Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, is it roughly ratable over that period of time, or is it sort of a hockey stick in terms of what you see in terms of the demand growth?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. It's fairly ratable, Paul. It's obviously not perfectly linear by any means. But the significant load really begins to come in in, say, late 2025 and into 2026, which is why a lot of the resource proposals you see at Georgia Power are to really serve the 2026, 2027 winter peak to make sure they're in place for that. And then it continues to grow from there.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nUtilities Analyst, Glenrock Associates LLC\n\nWell, thanks so much. Congratulations.\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\n\nChris Womack\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAgain, let me say Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023, and I am really excited about the future of this company. Let me thank everybody for joining us today and wish everybody a happy day. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Q4 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Q2 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speaker's remark. There will be a question and answer session at that time. If you have a question, please press star one on your telephone. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, you may press star, then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, 3 August 2023. I would now like to return the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Tommy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Q2 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today. In addition to providing historical information, various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our investor relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such a pivotal and exciting time for our company. As many of you know, on Monday we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 3 successfully achieved commercial operation. While work remains to bring Unit 4 online, this incredible milestone is something to be celebrated. This decade-plus journey, which involved developing a global supply chain, managing through a global pandemic, tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers, and millions of labor hours, combined with a group of committed co-owners and regulators that had the courage to support new nuclear power as an option when others didn't, proves that we can accomplish monumental things when we share a common vision. Vogtle Unit 3 is now serving Georgia customers with over 1,100MW of 24-hour, seven-day-a-week carbon-free electricity.\nTurning now to Unit 4. Since our last call, the project team continues to make substantial progress as highlighted by completion of hot functional testing, receipt of all 157 fuel assemblies, submittal of all ITAACs, and most recently receipt of the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission signifying that license acceptance criteria for Unit 4 have been met. The project team's current focus is on working through final testing and system turnover to operations that, when complete, will allow fuel load for Unit 4, recall as we contemplated in the VCM 17 Order. Georgia Power can file its prudence request with the Public Service Commission following fuel load on Unit 4.\nFollowing fuel load, the project team will conduct final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electrical power production side of the plant and achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for startup activities and initial criticality. Importantly, the project capital cost forecast is unchanged since last quarter, and we continue to project Unit 4 will be placed in service between late Q4 2023 and end of Q1 2024. The successful completion of this important project is critical for Georgia's and our nation's energy future. We look forward to these units providing reliable, carbon free energy to customers for decades to come. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q2 2023, our adjusted earnings were $0.79 per share, $0.04 higher than our estimate and $0.28 lower than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were milder than normal weather conditions, higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense, and changes in rates and pricing somewhat offset by lower income taxes and O&M expenses. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather in our electric service territories during H1 2023 has been the mildest on record, with the fewest aggregate degree days in the 129-year history of climate data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more commonly known as NOAA.\nThe -16 per share EPS impact relative to our weather normal EPS guidance range is our largest ever negative weather driven variance for the first six months of a year, which is a significant headwind for the full year. While 2022 was a year in which we were able to fix the roof while the sun is shining and position the company well. Coming into 2023, we have been and will remain keenly focused on cost management along with our constant focus on safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. In H2 2023, our adjusted earnings estimate for Q3 2023 is $1.30 per share.\nTurning now to retail sales and the economy year to date, 2023 weather normal retail sales were in line with sales levels for the H1 2022. We've seen positive residential and commercial growth, and strong commercial usage, offset by lower industrial sales. Year to date, we've added nearly 24,000 electric customers and 13,000 natural gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that Southern Company was recently awarded the number nine overall spot on Forbes ranking of America's Best Employers for Women, the highest ranking within our industry. We are honored to be selected to this list. Once again, workforce and leadership diversity is a tenet of ours and ensures we have the variety of experiences and perspectives to better serve our customers. We will continue to emphasize a culture where all employees feel valued, respected, and able to accomplish their professional goals. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. We'll proceed with our first question. On the line is from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go right ahead.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nShar. Good afternoon.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy, Power, and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey guys.\nGood morning.\nChris, that was the world record for the fastest prepared remarks, so congrats there on that one.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar.\nI always appreciate your comments and your analysis.\nYour perspective.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy, Power, and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThank you.\nJust starting on Georgia's economic backdrop and obviously you guys have seen a step change in the pace that major industrial customers have been announcing, you know, new capacity needs. How many, I guess new gigawatts are you seeing now in Georgia versus the prior update with the state? What is the prior IRP embed? How should we sort of think about any updates to capacity needs, including the viability of the remaining coal assets? As you're thinking about this incremental demand, so could we see a drastically different IRP being filed?\nThanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nCharles, we're working through that analysis now. I think we have said to you before and we've commented about all the wonderful economic development activity that we've seen across the state of Georgia over the past couple years. Some 250+ projects, $20+ billion of investment, some 60,000 jobs that I know the governor has reported. So I think, you know, we've talked about the impressive activity that we've seen. We've not turned that into the capacity needs at this time. That's some work that we're doing that we're doing, and I'm sure forthcoming will work with the commission on what all that means and then figure out what it means for us in terms of capacity needs going forward, but I think a little bit premature.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nAgain, we're kind of going through the analysis, but it's fair to say what we've seen from an economic development announcement perspective in the past is hundreds of megawatts at a maximum in a given year. And now we're having instances where it's thousands, potentially, in terms of the announcements. And so just the pace has accelerated. And you mentioned industrial. There's certainly a lot of large industrials involved with that, particularly around the electric transportation sector. But it's also data centers. You know, it's a story that's playing out in a lot of places. Just as an example for ours, I mean, as we sit here today, data centers are roughly 2.5% of our overall electric load. Five years from now, that will be well into the double digits in terms of percentage of our load. That's the pace of growth we're seeing.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSo I think.\nNo, I think something we're very excited about. No, we're very excited about it. I think it's a real positive contribution, positive factor that we're excited about here in the state.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy, Power, and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nDo you have a sense, Chris, on when you, Kim, Dan, and the team could update us around that potential opportunity? I know it's really early in the process, but we're obviously seeing the amount of customers that are moving to Texas, and it's very material. So, I mean, [tech co], Georgia, which is really material. So I'm just kind of curious on what the timing of that could be.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, sure. I think it's a little bit premature, but as soon as we get to that point and we figure out and have conversation with the commission, I'm sure we'll share that with you, share that with the industry.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy, Power, and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. Then lastly, Chris, we're obviously approaching, you know, the prudence case once we see unit four fuel load. Anything you can provide in how we should be thinking about a potential settlement or this? Should we be thinking about this as, like, a rate case and whether the potential for like, a special election could impact the process, if at all, especially if fuel load takes longer than planned?\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Charles, I think there are a couple of questions you embedded there together. First, around prudence. We have to get the fuel load. Once we get the fuel load, we'll figure out what happens.\nHaving transparency in the process is very important. But right now, once we get the fuel load, then we'll figure that out. We'll work with the commission and the staff on that process. I think you made reference to the makeup of the commission. I mean, I, you know, the sense is that we'll get through prudence with the current commission. We have no idea what will happen in the Rose case. So we're still waiting for that order, for that decision by the courts. But there's nothing more I can say about that decision at this point in time.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy, Power, and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. Thank you. Chris and Dan, very helpful. I appreciate it and congrats.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go right ahead.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Carly.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, Carly. How are you doing?\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nWell, thanks so much for taking the questions today. Appreciate it. Maybe, just starting in terms of what we saw during the quarter for weather, normalized demand a little bit weaker on the industrial side, but commercial still looks quite strong. Can you just talk about how things are evolving relative to your forecast and kind of how you could see that evolving as we continue to move through the year?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, absolutely, Carly. And we saw this earlier this year as well. From an industrial perspective, we're seeing two different dynamics play out that are negatively impacting growth. And one is the housing sector. So when it comes to things like lumber, stone, clay, and glass, to a degree, textiles, particularly where it involves carpet, just given the broader trends in the housing industry, we're seeing that impact some of our usage in the short term. And then the other thing is chemicals from an industrial perspective. So we've had one particular facility in Alabama that has slowed pretty significantly. Again, some of that was anticipated very early in the year. And so it's just playing out as we anticipated, just wasn't anticipated.\nWhen we kind of put our forecast together right before the end of the year, what we're really encouraged by is what we're seeing on the commercial and residential side. You know, I spoke to the customer growth that we're seeing from a residential perspective. Again, we've seen sustained levels well above what we were seeing pre pandemic. And from a commercial perspective, just a lot of different stories playing out in that regard. Some of it's economic development, some of it's this data center dynamic that I mentioned. And certainly a lot of it is just commercial, naturally following the residential growth as it pertains to how it's impacting our results.\nWhat's important to remember is kind of the revenue contribution of these two classes on a relative basis. A 1% change, industrial sales is only about $20 million of impact, whereas a 1% change in residential, commercial is more like $40 to 50 million. So in terms of a net implication for us, you know, we're getting the benefit of the residential commercial more than offsetting what we're seeing on industrial.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's super helpful. Thank you. Then maybe just on the financing front, in the context of the current rate environment, just you've got some financing kind of still outstanding for the rest of this year. Just how are you thinking about execution of the plan that you have as we move through 2023?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Carly, look, we're always going to kind of keep our options open. The flexibility you've seen us do the convertible debt instrument early this year, we typically lean, you know, on an ongoing basis toward just senior unsecured stuff of the parent. A lot of different instruments we've used across the utility franchises. I wouldn't characterize anything in our plans as out of the ordinary. We're going to be monitoring the market and making sure we're being thoughtful about, as we always are, maturities, about the mix between fixed and variable, and, like everyone's doing, monitoring the rates as actively as we can to make sure we're getting to the market when it makes sense.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nAppreciate the caller. Thank you.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYou bet, Carly. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Go right ahead.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nJulien. Hey, good afternoon, team. Thanks for the time.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey. Hey, great.\nThanks so much. Really appreciate it. Hey, look, just coming back to the other subject here on procurement and renewables. On the renewables front, I know we talked about this last quarter here. Curious to hear your latest thoughts, both on the utility side and ownership. I think that had always been kind of back after this year. How's that looking on that front in Georgia? And then separately, I think, Dan, last time we connected here, you were talking about the Southern Power effort looking like it was a tad bit more competitive in this environment in terms of your ability to actually win and accrue projects on that side of the house. You want to talk about some of the progress and maybe the evolution just with the rate environment where it is.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Julien, let me start with on the renewables front. As you know, in the 2022 IRP, Georgia had another 2,100MW of renewables approved during that proceeding. The first IRP would begin later this year targeting some 1,300MW renewable resources with operation dates between 2026 and 2027. I think you may have also seen Alabama Power got its renewable generation certification modified, some 2,400MW over a six-year period. So I think that will also be later this year. So we're proceeding, and we're looking forward to opportunities for us to own some renewables. Clearly we'll take advantage of the normalization of tax treatment between PTCs and ITCs and pursuing it from a best cost perspective. And we think we've got support from our commissions to for us to own more renewables. So we're looking forward to those processes as they proceed later this year.\nI think your other question, Dan. You want to talk about pricing?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nWell, I think the other question was around Southern Power and yeah Julien, the same continues to hold true. The radar screen of active viable opportunities for Southern Power is as strong as it's ever been. And look, we fully expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the right way there. We'll keep the same discipline we've always had in terms of the hurdles. We look for the risk profile, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparty. But I think my short message there on Southern Power would just be stay tuned, there's good things happening.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nSo bottom line, Julien, I think we're very optimistic on the regulated side of what the future holds for renewables, and we'll see how that plays out later this year.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Excellent. And then, just as you think about the generation needs that the prior questioners have been really kind of poking at here, aligned with, as you alluded to a second ago, the added ability to own some of this renewable generation through.\nThrough utility tax credit optimization if you will. Can you talk about that opportunity coming together and maybe specifically the timeline that you could see that starting to play itself out. I know we just alluded to the prior IRP cycle but you know, getting that the CapEx proposals, RFPs, and ultimately just seeing that load forecast updated.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, Julien, once again I think it's a little premature in that regard. Clearly, as I spoke to you earlier about the renewable process and the RFPs, we see that forthcoming later this year. Clearly, we've got some more work to do as we weigh it as we analyze the implications of this economic development activity and what it means for loads. And so we simply right now need to let the RFP process play out over the next few months and next few years. But we'll keep you updated as we move through the process.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, as we've said before, consistent with what Chris just said, this will come together from a plan and capital deployment perspective in the latter part of our forecast horizon. So it's not a 2023 thing in terms of capital deployment might, but probably not a meaningful 2024. Beyond that is where the real opportunity exists, and the other thing that's coming together to help drive this. I think you mentioned the economic development aspect, Julien. As all these customers are choosing to locate in our service territories, they are increasingly demanding to be served with renewable generation. That's just helping support everything we're trying to do.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYep, I hear you. Wish you guys the best of luck and hope to see you guys soon. All right, take care.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAll right, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go right ahead.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nJeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\nJust wanted to see, I guess with starting off, Vogtle here, some of the, you know, the issues at the, at the finish line here. Just wondering what learnings you take away from that and do you see the same type of issues materializing for Unit 4 or there are warnings here that can kind of head off any issues like that.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAnd Jeremy, one of the things we've commented for, you know, we said it probably for a few years now that there would be lessons learned if we transfer over from Unit 3 to Unit 4. Let me give you some examples of how that is playing out. On Unit 3, hot functional testing took 94 days. On Unit 4, it took 88 days.\nFrom 94 days, it took 42 days hot functional testing to complete to 103(g) was 371 days on Unit 3, 88 days on Unit 4. From cold hydro to hot functional test start was 191 days on Unit 3 to 103 days on Unit 4. So I think you're seeing clear examples of how lessons are being learned from Unit 3 over to Unit 4. And that work, those lessons learned will continue, I think, to show itself as we move through Unit 4.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful there. Thanks. And just kind of pivoting here. I think I saw that the DC Court overruled FERC's approval of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market. Just what do you make of this here and what's the path forward?\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, I mean, it remanded it back to FERC to clarify a couple of issues around the power pool. And there are some questions about, you know, who could participate in SEEM. And SEEM. There has to be interconnections. So I think they're simply remanded back for clarification of a couple of issues, but nothing big there. I mean, SEEM continues to operate and perform very well. Everybody's very pleased with the results of SEEM. So it will be. It's going to be remanded back to FERC like I said, with a couple of issues that they'll clarify for SEEM going forward.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thanks. And just last one if I could. What are you expecting on hydrogen reg from Treasury and what do you think Southern Power's potential to participate could be with Vogtle? The potential for green hydrogen here.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nLet me say something quickly about hydrogen now that Dan touched on any rules from Treasury. You know we're participating in a number of processes DOE has with Hydrogen Hub. So we're excited about that. As you may recall, we did a 20% blend at our Plant McDonough gas site. So we're excited about all the technology activity and the considerations that are going on around hydrogen. You know, we look forward to seeing if we can develop this market, get the pricing right, get the transportation of the product right, and then we can find off-takers. I mean, so we're thrilled by the possibility and how Vogtle can continue to serve customers in Georgia. So there are a lot of aspects of hydrogen that we get real excited about.\nClearly, there's a lot of work that we got to work through to get to that point to make it viable, commercial, commercially viable.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. Jeremy, in terms of the Treasury reg, certainly like most in the industry, I think for us it makes sense that those are as broad as possible going in to help kind of drive the deployment of the technology. Otherwise it just may be cost prohibitive for a lot of people to get it out there. Whether that's a permanent broadness or it's a temporary broadness that transitions to something more specific, I think that's going to be in the hands of the Treasury group in terms of Southern Power's opportunity to play there. Certainly Southern Power's wheelhouse is providing utility scale renewable generation to counterparties.\nTo the extent that we find opportunities in this space to serve an electrolyzer or another entity with a long-term contract, and it's a creditworthy counterparty and it meets all the same criteria, it certainly expands our universe of opportunities.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there, thanks.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll get to our next question on the line. It is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Go right ahead.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nHey Dave.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHow are you?\nDavid?\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, doing well. Thanks for taking my questions. You know, wondering if you might be able to touch a little bit on Form Energy. You had an agreement reached to Georgia Power this quarter. I was wondering how you are thinking long duration energy storage might play a role in your system over time?\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nOnce again, we're excited about the relationship that we've established with Form. You know, we have utilized, you know, the kind of four to six hour batteries, but we think a 100MW, 100-hour long-duration storage battery, some 15MW is, has got to be a part of the mix and it's got to be a part of the system and the grid going forward. So we're excited about what Form is doing. We were at their groundbreaking ribbon-cutting in West Virginia a month or so ago. So we are excited about Form and looking forward to their development as we go forward. But we think this has got to be part of the technology mix as we go forward and we're hoping they're going to be successful.\nAs you know, we pay a lot of attention to research and development, and we think as we look at a lot of solutions, whether it's emissions control or just making sure we maintain a reliable and resilient grid, we think technology advance is very, very critical. And so we're excited about the work that Form is doing, and we're glad to partner with them.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, that makes sense. And then, secondly, you know, obviously a big weather headwind that you're working through, and could you touch on the cost control, just your confidence level in being able to manage and find flex in your O&M budget for this year, and where are the key areas that you're looking at in terms of offsetting the headwind so far?\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, I think, and Dan said it in the conversation early on that we'll remain keenly focused on cost management. And so we know the weather we've seen is unprecedented, is the lowest warmest we've seen in history. And so we've got to correspond with that with similar focus on cost management. And so there are a number of efforts going on across the company to make sure that we are executing around cost management controls. And right now we feel good about kind of where we are, but we know we've got a lot more work to do as we go forward through the rest of the year.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, understood. Congratulations on Vogtle Unit 3 and thanks again. Appreciate it.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Go right ahead.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon, Dan. Seven minutes and 58 seconds of prepared remarks. I'll keep it real brief, hopefully. Just following up on David's question. So this quarter we had $0.04 of unfavorable weather versus normal, but you actually delivered $0.04 higher than your estimates. Is that all just cost cuts or are there other things that we should think about one time or is another thing?\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah, it's primarily cost reductions, Durgesh. I mean, there's always some little puts and takes here and there that are a little different than our forecast, but overall it's just the fruit of our labor. And kind of going back to Dave's original question in terms of where, frankly it'd be doing a disservice to highlight any particular area of the business where we're doing that because we're doing it everywhere. This is a significant lift and we're doing everything we need to do and pulling out all the stops to deliver.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, solid. And then just maybe if you can. Otherwise I'll just follow up with Scott. Just any.\nSort of initial takes on July weather.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nIt hasn't looked like the H1.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, thanks so much. Appreciate the time.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. Our next question on the line is from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Go right ahead.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey everyone, thanks for taking my questions. Hope you're doing well. Congrats on the Unit 3 news.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Nick.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nYeah, absolutely. So just looking forward to Unit 4 soon and then knowing that we're getting closer to that $700 million uplift that you've detailed in slides here on the CFO. Dan, maybe you can just remind us your preferred use of those cash flows as you roll forward your plan in the Q4. And I know we talked about improving balance sheet in the past, but I'm also cognizant you're talking up a lot of different CapEx opportunities in your region.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nYeah. And thanks for that question. It really is a kind of all of the above strategy, if you will, in terms of the opportunity to use this cash. And it's the three things that we're primarily focused on. You said one, which is to fund the capital plan. Right. So we'll be positioned as we had been historically, kind of pre-penalty ROEs and heavy construction on Vogtle 3 and 4, where our operating cash flow represents over three times the size of our common dividend. And so that leaves an awful lot of cash flow to deploy against this capital plan that we expect to continue to grow. So that's thing one, the number one priority of the things we're focused on.\nYou also mentioned this is credit quality, and what this does is provide an uplift to our credit metrics such that we're more in the 17 to 17+ range for FFO-to-debt, and the opportunity there is not to raise it to these levels well above our thresholds and then use that as some sort of currency to do things. That's the opportunity to just once again get back to being a premium credit utility and maintaining that position for the foreseeable future. So that's thing two. And then the third thing that we've talked a lot about is the opportunity that we'll have as our payout ratio gets kind of sustainably at or maybe a little below 70%. So call that maybe 2024, but more likely 2025.\nAn opportunity to go to our board and for Chris and I to make a recommendation to increase the rate of the dividend growth to be more aligned with our earnings growth. So it's again, all the above but really important things that this enables us to do.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nAll right, thanks for that. That's it for me today. Appreciate it.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThanks, Nick.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Go right ahead.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAngie, how are you?\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of US Utilites and Power, Seaport\n\nVery good, thanks. So just, you know, you guys have been in this combat mode for the last, well, for a decade almost, it feels like. And I know that there's still the prudence review ahead of you, but.\nI'm just trying to picture Southern in back to basics mode. So, I mean, what does it even look like? So that's one. And number two is, I mean, you clearly, the stock has re-rated somewhat. What is it that you think you can do? Well, besides just putting unit four online to further re-rate the stock from here.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nAngie, let me start with the first part of your question. In terms of being in combat mode.\nDuring this Vogtle period, I'd say we're going to stay in comeback mode in terms of execution. Yeah, hopefully we're going to be a little boring. We think boring is beautiful, but we're going to be incredibly aggressively focused on customers being at the center of everything that we do. Focus on the Circle of Life, making sure we maintain a constructive regulatory environment, providing world class service, and using your language of in comeback mode, but doing that in a very aggressive way that makes sure we're giving customers what they need from a reliability but also a resilient perspective, but also making sure we're paying attention to issues around affordability. So we have a lot of work to do and so we're going to be very singularly focused on execution.\nI think that's going to be very important as we also make the case that we deserve that premium valuation. And returning back to the days of.\nOld Southern classic,\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nit is no mistake and no accident, the first page of our deck has Circle of Life on it.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of US Utilites and Power, Seaport\n\nOkay. And then just maybe a smaller point. But you know, you guys have, you know, just like everybody else, more violent and impactful storms going through your service territory. Is there anything from one investment perspective to regulatory setup that could help you?\nYou know, harden the grid and also assure timely recovery of any costs associated with those with the climate change? Basically.\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nI would say, I mean if you look at our capital budgets today and getting past Vogtle, there are no really large projects, but it's a lot of blocking and tackling with transmission distribution, grid improvement programs, with undergrounding, with changing out circuits and improving technology, SCADA systems. So a lot of that work to enhance and improve reliability but also improve resiliency so that storms are more frequent, paying attention to more extreme weather, so doing the basic work to prepare for these kind of conditions and help us to maintain our focus on reliability and resiliency of our system.\n\nAngie Storozynski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of US Utilites and Power, Seaport\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDan Tucker\n\nCFO, Southern Company\n\nThank you, Angie.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\n\nChris Womack\n\nPresident and CEO, Southern Company\n\nHey, once again let me thank everybody for your calls today. It's a wonderful time for Southern Company as we brought Unit 3 commercial, and with the progress we're making on Unit 4, and we'll continue to press ahead and move forward. But again, thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you very much, and everybody be safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Q2 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of the day.",

My name is Kathy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 27, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.\nIn addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack.\n\nChristopher C. Womack\n\nExecutive VP & President of External Affairs, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am delighted to be joining you today on my first earnings call as President of Southern Company. I've enjoyed given the opportunity to interact with many of you over the last couple of months and look forward to meeting with many more of you in the months ahead. I am incredibly excited about the future of Southern Company, the energy industry and the valuable work that we're doing to serve our customers and communities. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us and proud to be a part of a team that is making such a significant impact in building the future of energy.\nAs you've watched us reposition our deep talented bench across the system, our mission remains unchanged, provide our customers and communities with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, while continuing to keep our customers at the center of everything we do. Also unchanged is our goal to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return. And I believe our financial plan supports that objective. The strength of our value proposition is a function of our customer and community, focused business model, the robust economic growth in our service territories and the constructive regulatory frameworks in our states. It is also a function of our discipline as we remain committed to our objectives of strong investment-grade credit ratings with a regular, predictable and sustainable dividend policy.\nAlong with our focus on long-term execution and value accretion, we are executing on our loan -- on our plans as we -- and believe we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2023. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for our financial update.\n\nDaniel S. Tucker\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer, The Southern Co.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted EPS was $0.79 per share, $0.18 lower than the first quarter of 2022 and $0.09 above our estimate. The major driver for the variance to last year was milder-than-normal weather as the first quarter of 2023 was the warmest on record in the Southeast. Higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense also impacted earnings for the first quarter compared to last year and were somewhat offset by constructive state regulatory actions. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. When looking at adjusted EPS impact compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were a strong start for our state regulated natural gas utilities and continued strong electric and gas customer growth.\nGiven the mid-February timing of our last earnings call, we were able to factor milder than normal January and February weather into our estimate for the quarter, so weather was not a major driver of our performance versus our estimate. You may recall that our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2022 were significantly better than projected due to weather and other market-driven factors. Our early 2022 outperformance supported our full year adjusted EPS performance and enabled us to accelerate maintenance activities in several areas of the business. Those initiatives had us well positioned with additional spending flexibility entering 2023, such that we expect the significant weather impact we experienced in January and February should be manageable over the remainder of the year, assuming a return to more normal weather throughout the balance of the year.\nTurning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather-normal electric retail sales were 0.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. This increase reflects stronger residential and commercial sales from continued robust net in migration to our service territories, a strong labor market and a return to more normal business trends. Industrial sales for the quarter were down 1.6% as we are beginning to see weakness in housing-related sectors, such as stone clay and glass, lumber and textiles due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. Half of the industrial variances for the quarter compared to last year can be attributed to the closure of a caustic soda manufacturing facility in Alabama. Excluding the impact of this single customer, industrial sales were down approximately 0.8%.\nIn a trend that continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from many other areas of the country, we once again saw record levels of economic development activity with job creation and capital investment announcements at all-time highs in the first quarter. We are beginning to see supplier announcements related to the Rivian and Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in Georgia, with six supplier announcements made during the quarter, totaling over 4,200 jobs and nearly $2 billion in capital investment. We expect additional automotive supplier announcements in the coming months.\nBeyond the automotive industry, Qcells recently announced a new $2 billion solar panel and component manufacturing facility in Georgia, which is expected to create 2,000 jobs. Additionally, the Port of Savannah continues to set records, posting its highest national market share ever and second busiest February on record. The port continues to expand capacity, including the recent announcement of the addition of 55 electric cranes, which are expected to eliminate 500,000 gallons of diesel consumption and related emissions per year.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Chris, I'd like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.80 per share. This action marks our 22nd consecutive annual increase and for 76 consecutive years, dating all the way back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record supports Southern Company's value proposition.\nAnd lastly for me, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.75 per share. Chris, I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nChristopher C. Womack\n\nExecutive VP & President of External Affairs, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd like to first provide an update on recent progress on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion time line and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. At Unit 3, we've achieved initial criticality in March and successfully synced to the grid earlier this month. We continue to work through final startup testing and commissioning and are currently performing testing at the 50% thermal power plateau. This testing is expected to continue in the coming weeks with extensions to higher power plateaus and force trips to test the unit's safety systems.\nFollowing completion of this final testing sequencing, and consistent with our long-term plans, we expect Unit 3 to enter into a brief maintenance outage window before returning to full power. After the successful completion of all appropriate preoperational and power extension testing, as well as any necessary fine-tuning, Unit 3 will be ready for commercial operations. We continue to project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023.\nTurning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter, with hot functional testing commencing in March, with lessons learned from Unit 3 continuing to benefit our execution on Unit 4, Hot Functional Testing is approximately 80% complete. We have already achieved peak planned output of the test and are currently in the process of cooling the unit back down with progress throughout the test that has been consistent with our plan. We project to complete Hot Functional Testing in the coming weeks to be followed by planned inspections and surveillance, along with the middle of our final ITAAC's receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC and fuel load later this year. Only six systems remain for turnover to testing for Unit 4, and we continue to project an in-service date between late fourth quarter of 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. We look forward to sharing our exciting progress in the weeks and months ahead as we bring these units online to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to the benefit of our customers in the state of Georgia for decades to come.\nIn closing, I'd like to highlight that Southern Company was named the top utility on Forbes Magazine Best Large Employers in America 2023 rankings. We ranked nearly 100 places higher than the next industry peer and the top 15 of the 500 large employers ranked for the second consecutive year. Being recognized amongst the best in the nation once again is an honor. This accolade is particularly gratifying because it is directly based on employee feedback. We are committed to creating a workplace where all groups are well represented, included and fairly treated with all -- within all levels of the organization and that everyone feels welcome, valued and respected.\nAt Southern Company, we aspire to be a leader in our industry. As such, we will continue to strive to create the best workplace possible for our thousands of team members who work tirelessly each and every day to provide world-class service to the customers that we have the privilege to serve. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.",

My name is Scott, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's year-end 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Georgia Power's CEO, Chris Womack, who will be succeeding Tom as President and CEO in the coming months is also joining us.\nLet me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\nSouthern Company had another exceptional year in 2022. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share consistent with the very top of our guidance range. These results were due in no small part to the culmination of the hard work of thousands of people throughout our company to put in day in and day out to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy.\nOur operations team, generation fleet and power delivery system worked exceedingly well in 2022 which included meeting an all-time peak load of over 41,000 megawatts in June and navigating well in extreme winter cold event over the Christmas weekend that pushed electric demand to a system peak load of nearly 38,000 megawatts, a December record. Our success with these events is a testament to the value of our vertically integrated state regulated business model delivers to our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve.\nA great example of the benefits which come from our state's long-term integrated planning processes is the 26% winter reserve margin factored into the capacity planning process. This winter reserve margin, which is significantly higher than typical summer reserve margin inherently recognizes that peak demand in the winter occurs during the dark early morning hours when solar resources are diminished and cold temperatures can have unintended adverse effects on generation and fuel supply equipment. Such thoughtful planning assumptions, along with robust winterization programs and a continuous focus on resilience investments are top of mind across all of our state-regulated utilities.\nLet's turn now to an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since our last call, the site team at Unit 3 has turned to testing and start-up process in support of the unit's next major milestone, initial criticality. During this process, as disclosed in January, we identified vibrations associated with certain piping within the passive cooling system, which required additional time to remediate. The site team cooled down the unit and successfully remediated the vibrations, allowing them to resume the testing, which precedes initial criticality.\nDuring this work, we identified a few additional issues to address, consistent with our focus on optimal long-term performance and getting it right. We've added some additional time to the Unit 3 schedule to address these items and to reduce the risks associated with other potential issues emerging. We now project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023.\nTurning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter. We successfully completed cold hydro testing in early December. Electrical production and terminations through year-end were sustained at levels supportive of our year-end 2023 in-service objective. All required systems necessary to start hot functional testing on Unit 4 have been completed and turned over to the initial test program. Component and system testing activities are steadily increasing and are now critical path in support of the next major milestones for Unit 4, hot functional testing and fuel load.\nWe have seen a marked improvement in testing results for Unit 4 compared to the Unit 3 process, which reflects the increased focus on first-time construction quality and timely documentation. Even with the improved results, somewhat slower than planned testing productivity has consumed margin in our schedule. The sites working (inaudible) continues to reflect a couple of months of remaining margin for a 2023 in-service date.\nAfter careful consideration and given our experience on Unit 3 and the degree of critical work ahead of us, we are further risk adjusting our Unit 4 schedule to reflect a range of the projected in-service date between late 4th quarter of 2023 and the end of the first quarter of 2024.\nTurning now to cost. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast reflects a projected increase of $201 million to fund the extension of Unit 3 and Unit 4 projected in-service dates to the end of the second quarter 2023 and to the end of the first quarter 2024, respectively, plus modest increases in the projected cost of resources to complete the remaining work and testing on Unit 4. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million during the quarter.\nWe've included project schedules for the next major milestones for each unit, including initial criticality for Unit 3 and the start of hot functional testing for Unit 4 in the materials provided for this call. Our priority remains bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We will continue to take the time needed to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule.\nDan, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nDaniel S. Tucker\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had strong financial results for the year with adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, $0.19 higher than 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with retail pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter of 2022, customer growth, increased usage and investment on our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M expenses and higher interest expenses. The increase in nonfuel O&M reflects long-term commitments to our regulated utilities to reliability and resiliency, along with efforts to advance maintenance activities in light of emerging cost pressures.\nAdditional shares from the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August '22 are also reflected in 2022 EPS results. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.\nWeather-adjusted electric sales were up 1.2% for 2022 compared to 2021, almost double the growth rate forecast for 2022 and back above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see robust residential growth with the addition of nearly 50,000 residential electric customers and over 30,000 residential gas customers throughout the year. Residential customer usage also continued to outpace our expectations, reflecting sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. Additionally, commercial sales for 2022 beat our forecast by nearly 2%, reflecting a reversion to pre-pandemic trends as the economy shifts from consuming goods to services.\nIndustrial sales for 2022 were lower than forecast by 1.5%, driven by a chemical facility closure and weakening industrial sales momentum during the second half of the year. With interest rates rising, we have seen slowing in construction and housing-related sectors, such as lumber, stone, clay and glass and textiles.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, 8 of our top 10 industrial segments experienced slower sales growth as compared to the prior quarter. Included in our 2023 guidance is an assumption of retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%. And as in prior quarters, we continue to monitor the potential implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook.\nThe economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. 2022 economic development announcements in our Southeast service territories saw an increase in expected job creation and capital investment of 135% and 257%, respectively, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years with new corporate announcements and expansions representing a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, technology, e-fulfillment and distribution, health care and bioscience.\nIn addition to the traditional factors that have historically drawn businesses to our service territory like transportation networks, lower cost of living and business-friendly state and local policies, another emerging trend that continues to drive momentum in both economic development wins and the size of the potential pipeline is the diversified workforce, especially technology workers and the diverse university systems in our territories, which prominently feature several HBCUs.\nWe're proud to have been on the forefront of helping develop this workforce through our significant investment along with Apple in the Propel Center in Atlanta. More and more, as other companies strive to have their workforce reflect the diverse global customers they serve, our Southeast service territories have become a top choice for relocation or expansion.\nWe are proud of the significant role that our subsidiaries play in attracting new businesses to our service territories. And in 2022, Site Selection Magazine named Alabama Power and Georgia Power, Top U.S. utilities for economic development for the fourth consecutive year and recognize the state of Georgia as the second best business climate in the country. Strong economic development activity continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from other areas of the country.\nTurning now to our expectations for 2023. Our adjusted earnings guidance range for the year is $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Expected drivers for 2023 versus 2022, our continued growth in our state-regulated subsidiaries, including the contribution related to Vogtle Unit 3 going into service, offset by higher parent company interest expense including financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with costs in excess of $7.3 billion seemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC and share dilution, reflecting the full year impact of the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August 2022. We estimate adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter.\nAdditionally, we are narrowing our 2024 adjusted guidance range of $4 to $4.30 which was established in early 2021. In order to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in providing guidance 3 years in advance, the original 2024 range was wider than our typical annual EPS guidance ranges. Since this range was introduced in February 2021, our state-regulated outcomes have been largely consistent with our assumptions. Several upside opportunities inherent in the top end of our original range, like renewable and storage investment opportunities at both our state-regulated electric companies and Southern Power have been deferred to later years largely due to adverse market conditions, including more challenging, contracting requirements and global supply chain constraints.\nFinancing costs, particularly parent company interest rates are a significant headwind relative to our forecast in early 2021. Rates on variable and short-term debt are significantly higher than expected, and as securities in our low-cost debt portfolio mature, new issuances, no matter the tenor, are significantly more expensive. Compounding these negative parent company interest rate effects are the growth in our state-regulated capital plans relative to early 2021 and the increased cost for Georgia Power share of Vogtle 3 and 4 which has grown by nearly $1.9 billion since early 2021.\nCollectively, these factors would narrow our $4 to $4.30 range, adjusted for 2024 to $4 and $4.10. Adding the potential for Vogtle 4 to be completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 which would have a negative $0.05 per share impact solely in 2024, we are providing an adjusted 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share.\nWe plan to further narrow this range during our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call early next year.\nWe continue to see our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with our updated 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range. This projected growth is supported by a $43 billion capital plan with 97% of total projected capital deployment over the next 5 years at our state-regulated utilities. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook.\nOur robust capital investment program continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated utility businesses, our total base capital investment plan of approximately $43 billion which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4 reflects a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our previous 5-year forecast.\nThese increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into infrastructure required to serve major customer additions and expansions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure, as well as investments related to the transformation of our generation fleet.\nWe have continued to maintain our disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state regulated utility businesses. Consistent with past practice, we don't include placeholders, and we don't include capital that isn't expected to earn our allowed regulated returns. The result of this approach is that our capital expenditure forecasts tend to grow, especially in the later years as our visibility into customer growth increases as regulatory processes unfold as compliance obligations evolved and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue.\nAdditionally, we continue to believe Southern Power has a significant opportunity to continue growing through investments that facilitate fleet transitions and the growth of clean energy infrastructure across the United States. Southern Power's business model has been distinctive since its beginnings in the early 2000s, focusing on long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that aligns well with our overall value proposition.\nWe've allocated up to $3.5 billion over the 5-year plan with approximately $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast period. These allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecast.\nOur financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $43 billion. As I have already suggested, we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated subsidiary forecast and our Southern Power allocation, which, if realized, would result in total spend of over $46 billion. We also continue to believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next 5 years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2027 as we continue our journey to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe've included a 3-year financing plan in the appendix to today's slide deck. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plan and the potential capital investment opportunities that we've highlighted, continues to assume no equity need over our 5-year planning horizon. As always, we'll maintain our discipline and the flexibility to use all the financing tools at our disposal to drive value for shareholders.\nCredit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a top priority and we continue to believe that to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must maintain a strong credit profile.\nAs we complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we believe the expected reduction in construction risk and the projected improvement in FFO to debt metrics further position us to support our credit quality objectives.\nTom, I will now turn the call back over to you.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan we've laid out will support that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investment in our state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our action towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions all contribute to making Southern Company a premier sustainable investment.\nOur remarkable dividend track record remains a vital component to our value proposition. For 3 quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including sustained dividend increases for more than 20 years.\nIn closing, I'm sure that most of you are well aware of the recent announcement of Chris Womack to succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer in the coming months. I will remain as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. In conjunction with this announcement, where a number of other senior leadership changes, which highlighted the depth of talent we've worked hard to develop at Southern Company.\nI expect each of these leaders will flourish in their new roles, further strengthen the company's deep bench and bring a fresh perspective to each of our businesses. With Chris Womack and his team leading us, the future of Southern Company is in great hands as we continue to strive to make the communities that we have the privilege to serve better off because we're there. And as we continue our relentless pursuit to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack for a few brief remarks before we get to Q&A.\n\nChristopher C. Womack\n\nCEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI cannot be more excited to have the privilege to lead Southern Company in the months and years ahead. It is an important time in our industry as the energy landscape continues to evolve and customers' needs continue to change. Southern Company is at the forefront of that evolution, and we are building the future of energy. It is an honor to lead teams that are dedicated to innovating and delivering world-class customer service and reliability to customers while also moving boldly forward in our journey to continuously represent our values and improve the communities we serve.\nTom and his predecessors along with the thousands of team members across the enterprise Tom mentioned earlier, have built a solid foundation for Southern Company. And we've got a lot of important work ahead of us to continue to build upon their legacy. Thank you all again for joining us this afternoon. I look forward to getting the opportunity to get out and interact more closely with each of you in the investment community during the weeks and months ahead.\nOperator, we are now ready to take questions.",

My name is Scott, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nDirector of IR, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\nJoining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.\nIn addition, we'll provide non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\nOur third quarter financial results continue to support our full year earnings objectives. And the economies within our service territories remain strong, including customer growth and economic activity that has outpaced our expectations. Given our financial performance through the third quarter, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share near the top of our earnings guidance range.\nBefore turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units remain consistent with what we outlined last quarter. Since our last call, the site team has continued to make substantial progress on Unit 3, highlighted by the successful achievement of several major milestones, including submitting the all ITAAC complete letter, receiving the 103G finding from the NRC, which signifies that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met, and successfully completing the safe transfer of all 157 fuel assemblies from Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the reactor core early last week.\nFuel load marked another historic and pivotal milestone towards startup and commercial operations. The focus over the next couple of months turns to final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electric power production side of the plant and achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is initial criticality or the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction, which is projected in January.\nOnce this important milestone is achieved, plant operators can begin the prescribed testing sequence, which includes a series of power ascensions and reductions, various sustained power output plateaus and multiple forced trips to test the unit's safety systems. This rigorous process is intended to demonstrate the performance of the unit under a variety of conditions and its readiness to be included in reliable dispatch and to be placed in service for the benefit of customers. We continue to project Unit 3 will be placed in service by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nTurning to Unit 4. Open vessel testing was completed in August and direct construction is now approximately 97% complete. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations remains a key area of focus. To support our projected December 2023 in-service date, recent electrical production levels must be sustained for several more weeks. Testing is expected to become the critical path as the project team progresses towards future milestones of cold hydro testing and the start of hot functional testing, which is projected by the end of the first quarter 2023.\nDan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\n\nDaniel S. Tucker\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Tom mentioned, we had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, $0.08 higher than the third quarter of 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with increased usage and retail pricing at our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M expenses consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resiliency, along with higher interest and share dilution from the mandatory conversion of our equity units. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.\nTurning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the third quarter 2022, weather-normal retail sales were 1.8% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all 3 customer classes, as we've continued to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 11,000 residential electric customers and 8,000 residential gas customers during the quarter.\nWe are encouraged by these trends and continue to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. Within our electric service territories, economic development announcements through the first 9 months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, reflect a 170% increase in job additions and a 237% increase in business investment.\nNext, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.35, we expect to achieve adjusted full year earnings near the top end of our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.23 per share.\nTom, I'll turn the call back over to you.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Dan. We remain encouraged by the sustained level of economic development activity within our service territories as we continue a long legacy of partnering with each of our states to attract new business. In recognition of these efforts, Alabama Power and Georgia Power were once again named to Site Selection Magazine's top 20 utilities in economic development out of approximately 3,330 utilities across the United States based on capital investment and job creation activity. We are honored by this recognition and look forward to continuing our commitment to helping our states and communities attract and grow businesses to further strengthen the economies within our service territories for years to come.\nIn closing, I would like to take a moment to highlight a significant safety milestone at the Vogtle project achieved this month, when the site successfully completed its 68 millionth job hour lost, I mean, without a lost time incident, but 68 millionth job hour without a lost time incident. At Southern Company, safety represents a key tenet of our uncompromising values and this milestone is a testament to the project team's focus on creating a safety-first culture. I'd like to recognize Sean McGarvey from the North American Building Trades and Lonnie Stephens from the IBEW along with all of the thousands of individuals that they represent for their tremendous ongoing support at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These groups have been terrific business partners for us, and the recent achievement of several major milestones is a tribute to the dedication of thousands of men and women committed to bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years.\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.",

My name is Tommy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nDirector of IR, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Tommy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.\nIn addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. The economies within our Southeast service territories remain strong, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022.\nBefore turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. The projected completion timeline forecast for both units remains within the ranges we provided the last 2 quarters, although at the end of those ranges. At Unit 3, we continue to progress with all necessary systems turned over from construction to testing, all inspection records related to ITAACs complete and then submittal of 51 ITAACs since our last earnings call, including 2, which were just filed this morning. 2 ITAACs remain outstanding.\nConcurrent with our final ITAACs submittals, we plan to submit the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC for Unit 3. This submittal should position us for receipt of the historic 103G finding from the NRC a few weeks later, documenting that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met. Upon receipt of the 103G finding from the NRC, no further NRC findings are necessary for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup up sequence.\nReceiving the 13G letter is an important milestone, but there's still more work to do before we load fuel. In the weeks ahead, we will be focusing on testing and surveillance, demobilization, finishing work and documentation. To support an in-service date at the end of the first quarter of 2023, we will need to complete this work and load fuel by the end of October.\nTurning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 96% complete and progress continues in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations continues to be a key area of focus. We continue to add resources on site for this work, and we have a plan for transitioning electrical field engineers from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first quality first times to support the upcoming testing and long-term operations.\nTimely Unit 3 fuel load and start-up, along with a sustained improvement in Unit 4 electrical production over the next several months is necessary to support our December 2023 in-service objective.\nMoving now to cost. At the end of the second quarter, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $39 million, including replenishment of contingency and estimated incremental co-owner sharing impacts. Contingency allocated during the quarter is primarily related to procurement activities for remediation and a revised resource plan for Unit 4 that reflects updated productivity assumptions and the planned increase in craft and support resources.\nWe're excited about the progress that we've seen at the site over the last several months and look forward to the transition of Unit 3 from construction to operations in the weeks ahead.\nDan, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nDaniel S. Tucker\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter, with adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, $0.23 higher than last year and $0.27 above our estimate. The primary drivers for the increases compared to last year and our estimate are higher revenues associated with higher usage, changes in rates and pricing and warmer-than-normal weather at our regulated electric utilities.\nThese revenue effects were partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation, along with higher nonfuel O&M, consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resilience. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.\nTurning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the second quarter 2022, weather-normal retail sales were 2.3% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all 3 customer classes, as we continue to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 12,000 residential electric customers and 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We remain encouraged by these trends and are continuing to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook.\nEconomic development within our service territories remains robust, with Alabama seeing a 10-year high in jobs and capital investment announcements during the quarter, led by announcements from Hyundai, Novelis and Airbus. Additionally, recent electric vehicle plant announcements in Georgia from Hyundai and Rivian represent the largest economic development projects in the state's history. These 2 projects alone are expected to create nearly 16,000 jobs and over $10 billion of capital investment across the state.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, the Port of Savannah continues to show strength, with the container volume growth seen during the first quarter accelerating in the second quarter as a result of U.S. consumer demand and the diversion of vessels from other ports driving record cargo levels in June. We remain encouraged by the level of economic development within our service territories, and we continue to partner with each of our states to attract new businesses.\nWith our solid adjusted results through the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric-load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2022 is $1.32 per share on an adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter.\nBefore turning the call back over to Tom, I would like to briefly highlight Georgia Power's 2022 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last week. Recall, Georgia Power files an IRP every 3 years, outlining the company's plan to continue delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers over the next several decades. The approved plan includes the addition of 2,300 megawatts of new renewable resources as part of Georgia Power's long-term plan to double its renewable generation by adding an additional 6,000 megawatts by 2035. The plan also approves the addition of over 750 megawatts of battery energy storage projects, the retirement of over 1,500 megawatts of coal by 2028, and the continuation of existing grid investment in ash pond closure programs.\nAdditionally, the approved IRP continues Georgia Power's hydro modernization program and authorizes initiating a license renewal application for Plant Hatch, each of which will extend the lives of these important carbon-free energy resources for the benefit of customers. The expected capital expenditures associated with approval of the IRP are consistent with the capital plan that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nTom, I'll now turn the call back to you.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Dan. For more than 5 decades, Southern Company's world-class research and development organization has remained at the forefront of innovation to build the future of energy today. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a couple of recent R&D announcements. Last month, Georgia Power and Mitsubishi Power, along with the Electric Power Research Institute, successfully blended 20% hydrogen fuel at Georgia Power's Plant, McDonagh, representing the world's largest hydrogen fuel blending demonstration project to date on an advanced-class gas turbine. This demonstration project helped pave the way for long-term clean and carbon-free use for existing natural gas-generating infrastructure.\nAdditionally, in Alabama, Southern Company continues to manage the National Carbon Capture Center for the Department of Energy, which recently surpassed 128,000 hours of testing, and has expanded its focus on advancing carbon capture for natural gas-powered generation, carbon utilization and technology-enhanced solutions such as direct air capture. In fact, a low-carbon concrete technology developed by Carbon XPRIZE winner, UCLA and CarbonBuilt, recently achieved its first commercialization deal bolstered by successful testing at the center. We are proud of the legacy created by our R&D group over the last 50 years and look forward to continuing this important work for many years to come.\nIn closing, I'd like to take a moment to highlight Southern Company's generating fleet and power delivery system, which performed exceedingly well through June's extremely hot weather. During what was the second hottest June in 50 years, we were able to maintain sufficient generating capacity reserves across daily peaks, including 6 days, which peaked over 40,000 megawatts, and an all-time peak load of 41,376 megawatts on June 15.\nDelivering these results requires effective long-term planning that is best facilitated in a vertically integrated, state-regulated markets, coupled with real-time coordination between our plants and our system operators. And I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the performance of our covered workers who, once again, performed during these times of duress in an exemplary manner. I'm proud of our team's continued outstanding performance during times when our customers need us the most.\nThank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.",

My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nDirector of IR, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Kelly. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.\nIn addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we've reported strong adjusted earnings results for the first quarter ahead of our estimates. The economies within our Southeast service territories are among the best in the United States, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022.\nBefore turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I will first provide an update on recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit.\nThe NRC completed its follow-up inspection last week and issued its final supplemental report. The inspection verified that Southern Nuclear effectively implemented the corrective actions and remediation efforts at the site. No additional findings were identified during the follow-up inspection and the findings identified last year have been closed. With this step complete, the Vogtle site returns to the baseline inspection program.\nLet's focus now on Unit 3. We continue to progress towards receipt of the NRC's 103G letter. All necessary systems have been turned over from construction to testing, and nearly all the inspection records necessary for submission of the remaining ITAAC are now complete. Associated with this progress, 70 ITAAC were submitted to the NRC since our last earnings call and 53 ITAAC remain. Of these remaining ITAAC, the last 30 to 40 are expected to be completed just prior to submitting the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC in support of the 103G letter. Considering our progress over the last 2 months, we have provided an updated ITAAC completion schedule.\nFollowing receipt of the 103G letter from the NRC and as Unit 3 continues its transformation from construction to operations, our efforts will be focused on completing the remaining inspection records, system turnovers and the necessary preoperational and component test required to load fuel later this year.\nTurning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 94% complete. Unit 4 continues to make progress in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. We believe we have the resources we need on site for Unit 4 and have a clear plan for transitioning additional personnel from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first-time quality. Overall, construction completion has averaged 0.9% per month since the start of the year, supportive of a September 2023 in-service and ahead of the 0.4% average projected to be needed through the year-end to achieve a December 2023 in-service dates. For electrical production specifically, progress on the Unit 4 is meeting our current expectations. However, electrical production will need to increase to support our projected in-service dates.\nThe schedule changes announced last year required Vogtle 3 and 4 owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project, which, in late February, they unanimously voted to do. This decision underscores the importance of the 2,200 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy, which will be vital to increasing the availability of net-0 resources for customers across the state. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationships that we have had with them across multiple endeavors for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership as we work to bring Vogtle units 3 and 4 safely online, providing Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years.\nWe are pleased with the progress at the site over the past few months and incredibly proud of the entire team at Vogtle units 3 and 4 for their relentless commitment to completing this important project safely and with the utmost quality.\nDan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\n\nDaniel S. Tucker\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2022 was $0.97, $0.01 lower than last year and $0.07 above our estimate. The primary driver for the variance to last year was higher nonfuel O&M, which reflects a trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to significantly reduced levels during the first quarter of 2021, and then largely offset by constructive state regulatory actions and robust customer growth at our state-regulated utilities.\nWhen looking at adjusted EPS compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were continued strong customer growth and cost control. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.\nTurning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather-normal retail sales were approximately 1% higher than first quarter 2021. This increase reflects stronger commercial and industrial sales from the continued economic recovery in our service territories, somewhat offset by lower residential sales as schools and businesses continued to transition from remote environments to hybrid or in-person modes throughout the quarter.\nWe also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of nearly 11,000 residential electric customers and over 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. This level of customer growth is driven by a strong labor market recovery and our Southeast service territories are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year.\nAdditionally, the Port of Savannah, which is the fourth largest port in the nation and a major contributor to jobs and economic growth in Georgia, experienced a 3% year-over-year increase in container volumes in the first quarter of 2022, ahead of 2021's record pace as elevated U.S. consumer demand continues to drive record cargo levels. Recent figures from the Georgia Port Authority also signaled that congestion is easing with only a handful of ships currently at anchor outside of the Port of Savannah, down from a peak of around 30 in mid-September of last year. Additionally, the recent approval of the Garden City Terminal West expansion is expected to increase the Port of Savannah's annual capacity by more than 15% by the end of 2024.\nThe economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. In the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter last year, economic development announcements in our regulated electric service territory saw a 168% increase in payroll additions and a 66% increase in business investment, respectively. The first quarter closed with 230 active projects in the pipeline for the State of Georgia alone, which is well above historical averages; and new job additions in Georgia exceeded 7,000, an all-time high for the first quarter of the year. We remain encouraged by the economic trends that we are seeing as we continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook.\nI have 2 final topics before turning the call back over to Tom. First, for the second quarter, our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.80 per share; and second, I'd like to highlight our recent dividend increase announcement. Earlier this month, The Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.72 per share. This action marks the 21st consecutive annual increase and for 3 quarters of the century dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record reinforces Southern Company as a premier sustainable investment.\nAnd as we mentioned on our last call, we believe once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider accelerating the rate of dividend growth, further supporting our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors.\nTom, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Sustainability has always been a top priority for Southern Company. In recent years, our plans and progress have received heightened interest from our investors, customers, communities, employees and other stakeholders. We have a long, strong history of constructive engagement with all stakeholders and we are excited about the recent release of a dedicated sustainability website, which provides additional transparency on core environmental, social and governance topics. This new site highlights the tremendous work underway across our company to help us reach our sustainability and business objectives as we seek to build the future of energy.\nAdditionally, just this week, we published a report outlining our just transition principles and look to continue enhancing our disclosures. We know that stakeholders are increasingly interested in information related to our sustainability efforts, and we remain committed to open and transparent communication.\nIn closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great job that employees throughout Southern Company do each and every day. National Lineman Appreciation Day, which was observed this month, specifically recognizes the important contribution of line workers and those supporting them to our country. From extreme heat to bitter cold to answering the call of those that need thousands of miles away for days and weeks at a time, the hard work and unwavering dedication that these men and women display day in and day out is truly inspirational.\nMoreover, last month, the Edison Electric Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers presented the prestigious Edwin D. Hill Award to Alabama Power and the IBEW System Council U-19. Through the National Utility Industry Training Fund and the Electrical Training Alliance, Alabama Power and the IBEW are providing current and prospective employees with the appropriate training necessary to install and maintain the fiber infrastructure that enables grid automation and resiliency and improves community access to broadband. It is an honor to receive this award, and we remain committed to continued support and investment in our workforce to ensure that our employees have the skills and training needed to successfully meet the ever-evolving needs of the customers that we have the privilege to serve.\nThank you in joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.",

My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nScott Gammill\n\nDirector of IR, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Year-end 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.\nIn addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2021, exceeding both our original 2021 guidance and the estimate that we provided on our third quarter call. This performance is due in no small part to our outstanding service territories and the unparalleled commitment of our employees to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers.\nOur outstanding customer service, our commitment to the communities we serve and our proactive engagement with our stakeholders are reflected in the numerous honors we've highlighted in our slide deck, including recent recognition as #2 in the nation on Forbes 2022 list of America's Best Large Employers.\nMany of the initiatives that support this distinction are reflected in our inaugural transformation report, which we released earlier this week. This report details our sustained commitment and actions to further advance equity, both within our company and our communities. These commitments allow Southern Company to help lead change within our communities and provide an enduring reflection of our values. We are proud of the progress we have made and continue to recognize the opportunity to do more.\nAs an example of the work we're doing to drive our customer satisfaction results, a meaningful portion of our capital plans in recent years has been allocated to the continued modernization of our electric grids. Our grid automation strategies and investments are delivering real value to customers. And in 2021, our customers experienced 15% fewer minutes of interruptions. Similar initiatives will continue to be a major component of our capital plans going forward.\nAcross all of our stakeholder groups, including employees, customers, communities and investors, we're focused on sustainability and a long-term view of value. That objective remains sound. The long-term financial plan that we outlined for you last year remains intact, and we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate expectation, consistent with adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4 to $4.30 in 2024.\nLet's now turn to an update regarding some of the recent developments related to our progress on plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you can see in the materials provided earlier today, we updated our expected completion time line for both units, extending the in-service dates for each unit by 3 to 6 months.\nAs we discussed on previous calls, the paper process is a critical aspect of turning plant components and systems over from construction to testing and operations. We have discovered incomplete and missing inspection records concerning much of the materials and equipment that have been installed at Unit 3. These inspection records are an important part of the documentation that is necessary to file ITACC.\nOur progress on Unit 3 ITACC has slowed as we address a backlog of tens of thousands of inspection records needing completion to support system turnovers. Through hard work over the last several weeks, we have reduced this backlog by more than 30%. Documentation within these inspection records is a critical aspect of getting it right and the time and resources to complete the remaining inspection records and remediate construction issues identified in the process, including the impact of borrowing Unifor Resources are key drivers for the change in schedule.\nWe have 123 ITACC remaining for Unit 3. The revised ITACC completion schedule we've included in our slide deck is consistent with a 3-month change in the Unit 3 schedule. Over the past year, a number of challenges, including shortcomings and construction and documentation quality have continued to emerge, adding to project time lines and costs.\nIn recognition of the possibility for new challenges to emerge, we further risk adjusted our current forecast by establishing a range of 3 to 6 additional months for each unit. And we've reserved for the maximum amount. We continue to make meaningful progress on both units, notably for Unit 3, all 157 fuel assemblies have been loaded into the spent fuel pool in preparation for fuel load. For Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 92% complete. Open vessel testing has started, and we recently completed the structural integrity and integrated leak rate tests without issue.\nThe aforementioned challenges on Unit 3 are serving as lessons learned for Unit 4 and has benefited our performance on Unit 4 to date relative to Unit 3. First time quality on both construction and documentation are key areas of focus. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online and again, to get it right, to provide Georgia with a reliable carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years.\nWith this most recent change in project cost and schedule, provisions in the Vogtle 3 and 4 co-owner agreement came to the forefront, requiring the owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project. Vogtle 3 and 4 is incredibly important to the state of Georgia and its robust growing economy. Furthermore, the addition of 2,000 megawatts of base load carbon-free energy is vital to increasing the availability of net-zero energy resources across the state.\nConsidering these facts and our proximity to commercial operation, Georgia Power has already voted to proceed. The other owners are required to vote by March 8, which allows time for them to work through their own governance processes.\nConsistent with the schedule extension of up to 6 months additional for each unit, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $480 million, largely as a function of time, additional resources to complete the remaining work with the necessary focus on quality construction and documentation and the replenishment of contingency.\nWe continue working constructively with our co-owners to resolve different interpretations of the cost-sharing agreement with an expected potential range of outcomes of $100 million to $900 million. We have included $440 million of the $900 million in our total project cost estimates.\nIn aggregate, Georgia Power's resulting total capital cost forecast is $920 million. And as a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $686 million during the fourth quarter.\nWe value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationship we've had with them across multiple assets for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership on each new unit as they transition to commercial operation, providing millions of Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity for decades to come.\nBefore turning the call over to Dan for an update on our 2021 financial performance and our long-term outlook, I'd like to briefly touch on Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission late last month.\nThe proposed plan sets forth a proactive, innovative and transformational road map for how Georgia Power expects to support customers in its growing service territory for decades to come. Consistent with Southern Company's path to net-zero carbon emissions, the plan describes a tangible path to transition Georgia Power's generating fleet to cleaner, more economical resources. This plan includes retirement of all of the coal units, Georgia Power Controls by 2028, except for Plant Boeing Units 3 and 4, which are scheduled to be retired no later than 2035.\nThe plan also includes a request for the addition of 6,000 megawatts of renewable generation by 2035, more than doubling Georgia Power's current renewable resources. Additionally, 1,000 megawatts of storage is requested by 2030 to improve the capacity value of these intermittent resources.\nIn recognition of the changing energy landscape, Georgia Power proposed innovative programs to promote reliability and resilience, including a distributed energy resource program. The comprehensive long-term plan also addresses continued investment in our transmission system and energy efficiency programs for customers. The IRP is subject to the review and approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission. Hearings will take place during the first half of 2021 with a final decision due this summer.\nDan, I'll turn the call over now to you. Please take it away.\n\nDaniel S. Tucker\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. All of our major subsidiaries had a strong 2021. As a result, our full year adjusted earnings were $3.41 per share, $0.16 higher than adjusted results in 2020 and $0.06 above the top end of our original 2021 guidance range.\nFinancial performance for the year was highlighted by strong customer growth, improving retail sales trends and continued investment in our state regulated utilities. These positive factors were partially offset by milder temperatures throughout 2021, resulting in a negative $0.05 variance for weather as compared to 2020 and a negative $0.14 variance compared to normal weather.\nAdditionally, 2021 nonfuel O&M reflected the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to the significantly reduced levels in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared to 2020 is included in today's release and earnings package.\nWeather-adjusted retail electricity sales were up 2.4% compared to 2020, approximately 1% better than our forecast for 2021. Almost all of this positive variance can be accounted for in residential electricity sales as a result of continued robust customer growth and an extension of the increased usage trends, which began in 2020.\nResidential sales outpaced our expectation for the year by 2.7%, reflecting what we think could represent a transition to sustained hybrid work practices across our servicers. We continue to analyze retail electricity sales relative to pre-pandemic levels. And in aggregate, in the fourth quarter, our weather-normalized retail electric sales exceeded sales in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by these trends, and we'll continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook.\nOur stronger-than-expected customer growth is a trend that differentiates our service territories. Over the last 2 years, we've added an average of nearly 55,000 new residential electric customers and 30,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities.\nAverage residential electric customer additions were 43% higher over the past 2 years than the average for the 5 years ended in 2019. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, and our Southeast territories are on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year.\nFurther supporting these trends, the economic development pipeline within our Southeast service territories remains robust. For example, the average number of job announcements was 22% higher and business investment in Georgia was 39% higher than average for the years leading up to the pandemic. Macro trends in e-commerce and electric transportation, combined with a diverse well-trained workforce and a low cost of living, have combined to drive major locations and expansions of distribution centers, data centers, manufacturing facilities and headquarters into our service territories.\nTurning now to our expectations for 2022, our adjusted earnings guidance for the year is $3.50 to $3.60 per share. The $3.55 midpoint represents a growth rate of approximately 7.5% from the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. In the first quarter of 2022, we estimate that we will earn $0.90 per share. Included in our guidance is a more normalized assumption for retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%, although a continuation of recent trends could deliver upside to that assumption.\nWe continue to see long-term adjusted EPS growth in the range of 5% to 7%, consistent with adjusted earnings in a range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the 5-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation.\nAdditionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Underlying our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% is a robust capital investment plan that continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated businesses.\nOur base capital investment plan of approximately $41 billion, which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4, supports our 2024 estimate for adjusted earnings per share of $4 to $4.30. This forecast represents a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investment for the common years 2022 through 2025 from our forecast a year ago. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into investments to upgrade our enterprise applications, serve major known customer expansions or further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure as well as investments related to the transition of our fleet.\nWe have long maintained a disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state-regulated utility businesses. We don't use placeholders, and we don't include capital that isn't expected to earn our allowed returns. The result of this approach is that our forecast tend to grow, especially in the latter years as our visibility into customer growth increases, as regulatory processes unfold, as compliance obligations evolve and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue, including in relation to Georgia Power's IRP.\nFor example, neither the long-term hydro investment plan nor the proposed company-owned energy storage systems are fully reflected in our forecast. Additionally, none of the renewable additions proposed in the IRP are included due to both their time frames and the potential for selecting purchased resources.\nFurthermore, we continue to believe Southern Power has significant opportunity to continue growing through investments to facilitate fleet transitions and the growth in clean energy infrastructure broadly across the United States.\nSouthern Power's model has been distinctive since its beginning in the early 2000s, focused on long contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that marries well with our overall value proposition. While we expect near-term opportunities to meet our criteria to be modest, we do believe opportunities will accelerate in future years. We have allocated up to $3 billion to Southern Power over the 5-year plan, with approximately $250 million in 2022, $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast. Again, these allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecast.\nIn aggregate, our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $41 billion, and we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated utility forecasts and our Southern Power allocation, representing spending of over $44 billion as part of our strategy to sustainably drive long-term growth in earnings and dividends.\nWe also believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next 5 years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2026 as we continue on our journey to net zero.\nAnd finally, we've included an updated 3-year financing plan in the appendix or slide deck today. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plans and the potential capital investment opportunities we've highlighted, continues to assume no equity need over our 5-year plan horizon.\nCredit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remains a top priority. The expected improvement in our consolidated FFO to debt metrics equates to 200 to 300 basis point increase from 2021 to 2022 levels by 2024. We've included a slide in the appendix to highlight some of the drivers for this expected improvement. Combined with the expected reduction in construction risk over the next 12 to 18 months, we believe we are well positioned to support our credit quality objectives.\nTom, I'll turn the call back over to you.\n\nThomas A. Fanning\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Southern Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investments into our premier state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our commitment and actions towards net zero, all contribute towards making Southern Company a sustainable premier investment. A remarkable track record for dividends is another major contributor to that equation.\nFor nearly 3 quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including dividend increases in each of the past 20 years. As we look ahead, assuming adjusted earnings within our estimated range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024, a payout ratio that is expected to be at or below 70% and a sustainable long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, we believe that once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider an increase in the rate of growth of dividends further solidifying our long-term value proposition.\nThank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.",

My name is Lydia, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now hand over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nInvestor Relations Analyst\n\nGood morning. ICE's third quarter 2025 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment, and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2024 Form 10-K 2025 3rd quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials.\nWhen used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income and Data Services.\nI'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our record third quarter results.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 10% year-over-year and the best third quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled $2.4 billion, and were underpinned by a 5% increase in recurring revenue. This recurring revenue growth was fueled by a 9% rise in Exchange Data and a 7% uplift in Fixed Income and Data Services, both reflecting sustained demand for our high-value proprietary data offerings.\nThird quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $981 million. Our disciplined cost management was further supported by approximately $15 million in onetime benefits, without evenly distributed across compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. After adjusting for these benefits, we would have been towards the low end of our guidance range.\nI also want to provide some color on our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 21%, which benefited from recent prior year tax audit settlements. Excluding this benefit, the adjusted tax rate would have been within the prior 24% to 26% guidance range. And as a result, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate will normalize to between 24% and 26%.\nMoving to capital allocation. We returned $674 million to our shareholders during the quarter, including approximately $400 million of share repurchases. In addition, we reduced debt outstanding by roughly $175 million, reducing gross leverage to just over 2.9x EBITDA.\nNext, I will touch on a few fourth quarter guidance items. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of [ $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion ]. Sequential increase is largely driven by the aforementioned onetime expense items not repeating in the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter adjusted nonoperating expense is expected to be between $180 million and $185 million, driven by a sequential uptick in interest expense related to our October investment in Polymarket. As a note, we funded $1 billion of that investment with CP issuance in early October and expect to fund up to an additional $1 billion in the future, also utilizing existing capacity on our commercial paper program.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $1.3 billion, building on strong double-digit growth in the prior 2 years. Transaction revenues sold $876 million. Importantly, towards the end of October, open interest across our futures and options complex surged 16% year-over-year, with energy futures up 14% and interest rate futures climbing 37%, underscoring the growing demand for our risk management tools amid shifting macroeconomic conditions.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled a record $389 million, up 7% year-over-year, underpinning growth in our record recurring revenues with 9% growth in our broader exchange data and connectivity services, which is once again led by our futures data, while also benefiting from approximately $6 million of auto-related revenue that we don't anticipate will repeat in the fourth quarter.\nIn our listings business, the NYSE helped to raise a market-leading $20 billion in new IPO proceeds through the first 3 quarters of 2025. It is worth noting that only roughly half of new IPOs have met the NYSE's listing standards, and these high standards remain a critical component of our 99% retention rate. As a result of this strong performance within our exchange data business, we now expect full year growth to be towards the high end of our 4% to 5% guidance range.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled a record $618 million, including transaction revenues of $123 million. On a year-over-year basis, ICE Bonds revenues increased 15%, driven by 41% growth in our muni business, which was in part driven by growing institutional adoption.\nWithin our CDS business, results were largely driven by lower member interest, a direct result of the lower Fed funds rate when compared to the year ago period. Recurring revenue totaled a record $495 million and grew by 7% year-over-year.\nIn our fixed income data and analytics business, record third quarter revenues of $311 million increased 5% year-over-year, driven by growth in pricing and reference data in our index business, which reached a record $754 billion in ETF AUM at the end of the third quarter.\nData network technology revenues were a record -- increased -- and increased by 10% in the quarter, an acceleration from 7% growth in the first half and 5% growth in 2024, driven by heightened demand for our ICE Global Network. Our strategic investments in data center infrastructure are paying off, driven by increasing demand for data and increased capacity as well as clients preparing to integrate AI into trading workflows. We also continue to drive high single-digit growth across our consolidated feeds business and our desktop solutions as we continue to realize the benefits of investments to enhance our platform.\nWorth noting that the third quarter included a few million dollars of onetime revenue that we don't expect will repeat. That said, we still anticipate fourth quarter revenue growth in data and network technology to be in the high single-digit range, and for total segment recurring revenue to be between 5% and 6%, both the fourth quarter and the full year.\nPlease look to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology results. Third quarter revenues totaled $528 million, up 4% year-over-year. Recurring revenues totaled $391 million and increased on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by our data and analytics business and MSP within our servicing business.\nShifting to the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to remain at these levels, primarily driven by Mr. Cooper's acquisition of Flagstar, and customers resetting their minimums on Encompass, which I'll note is paired with the benefit of higher transaction fees. We expect these items to largely be offset by revenue from new customers coming online.\nTransaction revenues totaled $137 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by double-digit revenue growth related to Encompass closed loans and high single-digit growth from MERS registrations. As you look to the fourth quarter, it's important to remember typical seasonal impact on purchase volumes, which tend to be lighter in the fourth quarter relative to the second and third quarters.\nIn summary, the third quarter was -- once again grew revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, building upon our record first half results and representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. And as we continue to strategically invest in our future, we have also returned over $1.7 billion to shareholders year-to-date. As we look to the end of the year and into 2026, we remain focused on extending our track record of growth and on creating value for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Technology and innovation have been foundational to ICE since our inception. Our approach to AI is a natural extension of that legacy. We are using it to accelerate our existing 25-year automation journey by building and implementing tools to drive efficiency and deliver enhanced analytical insights for ICE and our customers. We are now taking the next step by combining our pursuit of workflow automation across our business processes with the solutions we provide to our clients through generative and agentic AI under the name of ICE Aurora.\nAs we continue to expand our AI capabilities, we're leveraging 3 core strengths: deep operational and complex workflow expertise; highly differentiated proprietary data, which we believe will only grow in value; and the powerful network effects of our platform. We started with a deep understanding of our data, workflows, task and document management as well as the rules and compliance frameworks of our businesses. We then conducted a risk assessment of how much automation can be applied to executing these workflows based on the impact, technical maturity, accuracy and model explainability in the AI tools available balanced against the risks of automation.\nSimilar to benchmarks used across industries to measure the scale of automation, we rank our automation within processes on a scale of 0 to 5. At 0, the process is entirely manual. At 5, the process is fully automated, including exception handling without requiring human input. We are applying this model to every workflow across ICE, bottom up, measuring exactly where we are today in terms of the maturity of AI models automating workflows with or without human intervention, and where we can get to based on the current state of the technology.\nCurrently, most generative or agentic AI models at their core are best at pattern recognition, and this recognition continues to evolve. This means there is a stochastic and probabilistic accuracy to them, measuring the reliability and predictability of the outcomes AI models produce. For the highly regulated businesses that we and our customers operate, there has to be an acknowledgment of how much accuracy a probabilistic outcome must have in order to be considered acceptable for full automation versus when some level of human interaction remains necessary, especially in exception handling.\nToday, we have clear visibility of where we can go and are executing on this in many areas balanced by the risk I just outlined. That is our strategy and what our ICE Aurora platform is all about, and we're already seeing results across ICE. AI is streamlining and automating workflows across systems, accelerating product development and dramatically accelerating the speed with which we can deliver the modernization of multiple tech stacks within ICE. Importantly, we aim to do this without compromising our adherence to information security, data management and privacy.\nIn our energy markets, the macro AI and data center expansion trend is expected to drive significant energy demand over the next decade. We believe our trading and clearing platform, which offers deep liquidity and price transparency across the full energy spectrum, is uniquely positioned to support customers.\nDespite lower overall market volatility, the third quarter of this year was the second strongest third quarter in our history, following the record quarter of a year ago, led by continued strength in our global gas and power markets, with third quarter volumes up 8% and 18% year-over-year, respectively.\nAs we've consistently said, open interest is a leading indicator of future growth, and we're pleased to see it continue trending higher with record futures Energy OI in October up 14% year-over-year, including 25% and 30% growth in our Brent and TTF benchmarks, respectively. This reflects the value of our diversified energy platform, the depth of our liquidity and the confidence customers place in our benchmarks, which serve as global price reference points across thousands of related contracts providing trusted price transparency across geographies.\nAcross our global gas portfolio, which spans North America, Europe and Asia, volumes have increased 20% year-to-date. Importantly, this strong year-to-date performance has been underpinned by broad-based strength, including a 16% increase in our North American complex, a 26% increase in our European portfolio and a 27% increase in our Asian JKM market.\nIn parallel, our power markets have seen continued growth, with volumes up 21% year-to-date and 18% in the quarter. This reinforces the synergy between our gas and power markets and the need for comprehensive risk management tools that offer transparency, flexibility and choice.\nIn Fixed Income and Data Services, driven by multiyear investments, our comprehensive platform delivered another quarter of record revenues, which grew 5% year-over-year, including 7% growth in recurring revenue and 10% growth in our data and network technology business. Our proprietary data is the cornerstone of our business and a key differentiator in the evolving AI landscape. With over 50 years of experience, our high-quality pricing and reference data serves as the foundation for what is today, one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. From benchmark indices and analytics to custom solutions, we support the full ETF ecosystem.\nAs AI becomes embedded in trading strategies across all areas of investing, we expect our proprietary data to grow in strategic importance, with our data sets providing a competitive edge to users of AI models that depend on precision, depth and large quantities of historical data. Our data is securely managed within ICE's infrastructure, protected by firewalls and entitlements. Our commercial agreements tightly control access and only permits specific use cases through authorized delivery channels. This approach helps ensure our data remains exclusive and strategically deployed, especially as models increasingly rely on high-quality inputs to drive performance.\nIn our reference data business, we're leveraging AI to process and validate documents from hundreds of sources, using AI models that we thoroughly test for fit-for-purpose and high probabilistic outcomes from Google, Meta, Amazon and several other AI models, achieving over 95% accuracy in extracting reference data from fixed income prospectus. This capability is a critical part of the collection process, improving both efficiency and speed of delivery, enabling us to do more with the same resources.\nToday, within our reference data business alone, we are processing roughly 40,000 documents on average per month using AI. Documents assessed by AI that meet predefined confidence thresholds go straight into our database for clients to consume, while those falling below the threshold are flagged for manual review and intervention. This capability is a critical part of the collection process, improving both efficiency and speed of delivery, enabling us to do more with the same resources.\nWe're also leveraging machine learning to power key components of our evaluated pricing. Our continuous evaluated pricing blends trade and quote data to predict bond pricing, complementing our deep market expertise and data quality workflows. Additional models use historical data to determine bid-ask spreads across the bond universe, with machine learning capabilities significantly improving evaluation quality when measured against actual trades in the market.\nMeanwhile, our ICE global network continues to set the standard for resiliency, latency and security, connecting participants to over 750 data sources and more than 150 trading venues, including ICE and the NYSE. The ICE Cloud comprises state-of-the-art data centers owned and operated by ICE and facilitate seamless integration with key third-party cloud providers, all under ICE's cybersecurity and operational resilience framework. This provides our clients flexibility to access AI workloads where it makes the most sense without compromising cyber and operational controls.\nWe continue to invest in our data centers to support business growth needs and to meet growing customer demand, including to support increased adoption of AI strategies. This is to ensure we are accessing the most cost-effective, secure and reliable infrastructure for ICE's needs and our customers' needs, both now and in the future.\nAcross product development, AI is automating data analysis, pattern recognition and repetitive processes using tools such as GitHub CoPilot, freeing product managers to focus on validation and enhancement. This has already accelerated speed to market for certain products. For example, we've reduced the time to convert code for index qualification, calculation and reporting by roughly 60%.\nDemonstrating the new innovation underway across ICE, we're utilizing AI with our new sentiment indicator data sets including Reddit, Dow Jones and soon, Polymarket, with Google and Meta AI models helping to process these data sets and identify patterns. While still in the development phase, these data sets are particularly attractive to market participants seeking an edge through differentiated data inputs. This illustrates how our proprietary data set is set to become increasingly vital to a trading community reliant on models to support trading decisions.\nIn our mortgage business, the use of AI is helping our efforts to streamline the homeownership experience, enhancing productivity of lending and servicing operations, improving the borrower experience with self-service workflows, reducing risk via automated compliance and quality checks across the mortgage life cycle, all while improving recapture rates for our customers. All of this contributes to lowering the cost to originate and service alone for our customers, a foundational part of our mortgage strategy.\nFor example, customers using our industry standard loan servicing system, MSP, saved roughly 20% to 30% on the cost to service a loan based on a recently conducted customer study, and we expect this number will increase with new innovations that we have come to market or are coming to market, such as our enhanced customer service, loan boarding, ICE Business Intelligence for servicing and our loss mitigation [indiscernible]. This execution reinforces our clients' trust in us to enhance and streamline their business workflows through our workflow automation capabilities.\nIn the third quarter, despite a tough macro backdrop, revenues increased 4% year-over-year, while transaction revenue grew 12%. We also continued to win new clients, signing on 2 new clients to MSP, both already on Encompass, and building on the 2 we signed in the second quarter, including [ WM ]. We also signed 16 new Encompass clients, 5 of them already on MSP or an MSP subservicer.\nWe've also made significant progress in re-platforming MSP from the mainframe to ICE's modern tech stack to give us increased agility, cost efficiency and scale. Here, tools such as GitHub CoPilot have helped us achieve a significant improvement in productivity, helping us rewrite the entire user interface by the end of this year and migrate 30 million lines of code, with roughly 1/3 complete, and the remaining targeted to complete within 2 years. The original estimate to complete this project was baseline to take up to 7 years, similar to the move off the mainframe following our acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation. With the assistance of GitHub CoPilot and other AI-based code conversion tools, we have reduced the projected window to around half the time originally anticipated, a significant improvement to the speed with which we can now convert old technology processes to ICE's modern tech stack.\nAnother interesting area where we're applying our AI adoption model is in customer service. Here, we have evolved our capabilities to a level of conditional automation, one where there is significant automation but still requires human intervention for exception handling. We are using generative AI to provide predictions for a customer service representative on call intent and then call summarization.\nWe are next applying agentic AI to automate department handoff for issue handling. Then we plan to take this to the next level by adding a chat bot designed to go beyond search capabilities, one that also executes real action, such as payment scheduling for borrower self-service within our ICE mortgage technology servicing digital application. And we will work to expand even further with an intelligent virtual agent for certain issue resolution, where the maturity of the solutions and the quality of the probabilistic outcome is balanced against risk.\nIn summary, as ICE continues to enhance our leading technology, we do so with both the client and end consumer in mind as well as always considering what will make us more operationally efficient and deliver solutions that help automate workflows.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Please turn to Slide 9. Given ICE's recently announced investment and business relationship with Polymarket, I thought it might be helpful to explain our thinking on the evolution of markets.\nICE was an early investor in the crypto space, having been an early-stage funder of back and coin base. We made these investments in order to stay close to the evolution of the market's use of blockchain. In the case of [ BAC ], we thought that there could be an acceptance of a system of tokens that adhere to a high level of then existing securities and commodities regulation. We found, however, the traditional regulated financial firms were slow or unwilling to adopt tokens during a period of regulatory uncertainty, particularly where events of default would move unwanted tokens onto a financial guarantors balance sheet.\nCurrent U.S. administration and Congress have been attempting to address these uncertainties, which has caused ICE to more actively lean into the knowledge that we've accumulated over the past decade. One of the significant macro trends of the past decade of blockchain investment is a rewiring of the rails of the banking system. ICE, for example, operates 6 clearing houses around the world, all of which are highly regulated and which are required to operate within the limitations of local banking hours, customs and preferences.\nOn chain banking now operates globally with 24/7 availability, allowing for instantaneous margin calls and trade liquidations. This facilitates increasing margining and lending against assets, which some cohorts of asset holders are clearly taking advantage of with increased risk management tolerances, and which places excess trade financing collateral into an omnibus stablecoin collateral pool. This excess collateral pool is funded by traders via the forfeiture of earnings on their collateral. Features that were previously unavailable to regulated clearing houses.\nICE decided to invest in Polymarket as we're impressed with the design of its underlying architecture of smart contracts that take advantage of this new banking infrastructure. Alongside our investment, we've also announced a strategic data agreement, under which ICE will become a global distributor of Polymarket's highly differentiated event-driven data. As the leader in nonsports prediction markets, Polymarket provides real-time probabilities on events like elections, economic indicators and cultural trends, offering a powerful new layer of insight, supporting more informed decision-making.\nWe believe that we can accelerate Polymarket's acceptance into the traditional financial system by virtue of our distribution, understanding and long-time customer relationships. And we believe Polymarket's engineering team can help ICE's engineers better understand our own adoption of evolving banking technology, a relationship that is already paying dividends to both of us.\nICE is in the process of rolling out an advanced clearing model for our global clearing houses, one that we've very elegantly named ICE Risk Model 2. Our new clearing system was built on the existing local banking and regulatory infrastructure for funds movement and collateral management. However, the current regulatory environment is being confronted by collateral management using tokens, which I believe will help evolve regulatory oversight to take advantage of 24/7 capital movement.\nAnd ICE intends to be at the forefront of driving this evolution, given our own use case of operating 6 global clearing houses with different collateral and regulatory environments. Such an evolution can make global clearing and trade settlement more efficient. And we've seen that the efficient use of collateral typically results in increased trading volumes and transaction revenues. One does not have to look too far to see that trading volumes in the U.S. equities markets have dramatically increased since the industry freed-up collateral by moving from T+ 2-day to T+1 day settlement times.\nBeyond the rewiring of funds movement, Polymarket has pioneered the rapid listing of new markets, driven by real-time consumer demand. Traditional exchanges have been subject to government approvals of our new product launches, which, at best, take 30 days. And in many countries, substantially longer. Polymarket is forcing a dialogue in the U.S. on how to minimize government regulatory burdens, so as to not impede innovators. We think this dialogue will ultimately benefit new product innovation for all markets, and certainly for ICE.\nNow augmenting on Ben's comments on the adoption of artificial intelligence. We see the [ jag ] in intelligence phenomenon at play for both our own AI adoption and for that of our customers. Internally at ICE, we have our engineers using copilots to help them write code more effectively, particularly where the projects involve modernizing our legacy code. However, to fully deploy production code at scale and at the latency precision which ICE operates, we still require unique skill sets that are not now available in AI. So our current experience is that AI has become a good assistant for our teams, but not a replacement.\nBen also highlighted our use of AI in improving our customer service. Artificial intelligence has made our help desk more efficient at diagnosing real-time issues as well as cataloging and summarizing customer inputs to create more efficient feedback loops.\nThe third area where we deployed AI is in our data gathering and data organizations such as cataloging bond and equity prospectuses, cleansing our data sets and organizing unstructured data for our vast financial data offerings.\nAnd lastly, much of the regulation that ICE is required to oversee is surveillance in the form of pattern recognition. Here, again, AI tools are making our colleagues more efficient at our oversight. So in summary, our internal use cases for AI have made our colleagues better at what they do.\nIn terms of our customer adoption of AI, we see that same [ jag ] in intelligence, where AI is very helpful in some areas, yet unreliable in others. Where our customers interface with ICE products for pattern recognition or language organization, we're seeing positive uptake. For example, we've seen healthy uptake of our structured and unstructured financial data offerings. Similarly, the AI tools that we've built into our mortgage network, such as our data and document automation and our customer engagement suite have strong interest, with customers adopting these tools to more efficiently target new business and minimize the cost of mortgage onboarding, but not to replace underwriting decisions that are subject to regulatory oversight or to replicate the vast ICE mortgage network that links the industry together, including the U.S. federal housing regulators supervisory efforts in validating GSE and Federal Home Loan Bank mortgage holdings and providing it with monthly mortgage service information.\nFinally, a number of people have speculated to me that the overall volumes of trading must have increased due to AI adoption. While that's possible, I believe that a significantly larger volume impact has come from capital being freed up when moving equity settlement times 1 day forward and with the expansion of retail trading leverage that's inherent in popular 1-day options. So all in all, we think the current state of AI is helping to control costs and control new hiring in -- and is for us at the margin, driving sales and transaction growth.\nOur record third quarter results on top of our extraordinary third quarter results of last year are another example of strong execution across our all-weather platform. We very intentionally positioned the company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate these all-weather results.\nI'd like to end our prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business, and thank you for your trust. And I'd also like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to the very best third quarter in our company's history, following on our unsurpassed first half results, and yielding the best year-to-date performance in the company's history.\nI'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Lydia, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share were a record $1.81, up 19% year-over-year. These record results were led by a 9% increase in net revenue to a record $2.5 billion, with growth contributions from all 3 of our operating segments. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $983 million, and were towards the low end of our guidance range, driven in part by additional technology-related savings and synergies. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted operating income increased by double digits to a record $1.6 billion up 13% and on top of 11% pro forma growth in the second quarter of 2024.\nThis strong business performance allowed us to return $532 million of capital to our shareholders during the quarter, including $255 million of share repurchases. Through the first half, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends. And we did this while also investing in our business and reducing leverage, which ended the second quarter at our target of 3x EBITDA ahead of our initial target when we closed the acquisition of Black Knight less than 2 years ago.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues sold a record $1.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year and on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of 2024. Record transaction revenues of over $1 billion were up 15% and driven by a 20% increase in our interest rate business, record NYSE cash equities and option revenues up 10% and another quarter of record energy revenues, which grew 25% year-over-year. In addition, volumes in July continued to be strong with Energy ADV up 11%, interest rate ADV up 24%, our cash equity ADV up 54% and our equity option ADV up 6%, and importantly, open interest continues to build up 12% year-over-year, including 40% growth in global interest rates and 5% growth in our energy markets.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE Listings business, revenues totaled $378 million, up 5% year-over-year. Underpinning growth in our recurring revenues was our broader exchange data and connectivity services, which grew 6% was once again led by our Futures Data Services. In our Listings business, the NYSE helped to raise approximately $9 billion in new IPO proceeds in the first half and an additional $4.5 billion so far in July. It's worth noting that only roughly half of new IPOs have met the NYSE's listing standards, and these high standards remain a critical component of our 99% retention rate.\nAs a result of this strong growth, particularly across our Futures, Data and Connectivity solutions, we now expect full year growth in our Exchange recurring revenues to be approximately 4% to 5% compared to prior expectations for low single-digit growth.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled a record $597 million, including transaction revenues of $114 million, on a year-over-year basis, revenue at ICE bonds increased by 8%, driven by 28% growth in our [indiscernible] business, which was in part driven by growing institutional adoption. Within our CDS business, revenues increased year-over-year with lower member interest offset by clearing revenue, which increased by 25% year-over-year.\nRecurring revenue totaled a record $483 million and grew by 5% year-over-year. In our Fixed Income Data & Analytics business, record second quarter revenues of $306 million increased by 4%, driven by growth in Pricing and Reference Data and our Index business which reached a record $743 billion in ETF AUM at the end of the second quarter. Data and Network Technology increased by 7% in the first half and in the second quarter, an acceleration from 5% growth in 2024. Growth was driven by our ICE global network, continued growth in our consolidated [indiscernible] business and strong performance across our Desktop Solutions as we continue to realize the benefits of investments to enhance our platform.\nPlease flip to Slide 7, where i will discuss our Mortgage Technology results. Second quarter revenues totaled $531 million, up 5% year-over-year. Recurring revenues totaled $395 million and increased on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by Data and Analytics and our Servicing business. As we look to the second half, we anticipate the recurring revenues will remain around these levels, driven by the typical roll-off of inactive loans on MSP, which will impact the third quarter, M&A-related attrition, primarily driven by Mr. Cooper's acquisition of Flagstar and customers resetting their minimums on Encompass, which I'll note is paired with the benefit of higher transaction fees.\nWe expect these items to largely be offset by revenue from new customer implementations and cross-sell expansions. Transaction revenues totaled $136 million, up 15% year-over-year, driven by double-digit revenue growth related to Encompass closed loans, [indiscernible] registrations and default management solutions within our servicing business.\nBefore I turn it over to Ben, I will highlight a few third quarter guidance items. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $995 million to $1.005 billion. Relative to the second quarter, the increase is expected to be driven by higher customer acquisition costs at the NYSE as the IPO market rebounds as well as higher technology spend related to our data center build-out and strategy.\nLastly, moving below the line, adjusted nonoperating expense is expected to be between $170 million and $175 million in the third quarter. In summary, we delivered record second quarter and first half results. including record revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS, building upon our record 2024. We also once again achieved our leverage target ahead of schedule. As we look to the balance of the year, we're focusing on -- we're focused on a strong finish to a record first half and on setting ourselves up for continued success in 2026. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Across our futures and options markets, we've worked for nearly 3 decades to build out the scope and depth of our multi-asset a multi-geography offering to allow for both flexibility and precision trading from wherever in the world, customers choose to trade on ICE. As a result, record of over 1 billion contracts have traded on ICE through the first half, including a record 673 million energy contracts and a record 462 million interest rate contracts. This record performance drove 19% revenue growth in our Futures and Options revenues in the first half and is strong evidence of ever-growing need for global risk management as our customers continue to turn to ICE to manage risk across the thousands of contracts offered on our platform.\nAcross energy, markets have grown more global, more interconnected and more complex, shaped by shifting trade flows, regional dynamics and growing complexity and how energy is transported, produced, priced and consumed. We have continuously invested alongside this evolution, recognizing the importance of [indiscernible] on our platform. Today, as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any single product or limited to any one region. Instead, we have built a diverse energy network that provides deep liquidity and price transparency across the spectrum of fuel sources from oil and refined products to coal, natural gas, power, environmental markets, renewables and ancillary products such as biofuels and their related credits.\nIn essence, regardless of how the market evolves, whether driven by geopolitical change, shifting trade flows or growing demand in the developing world, we have strategically positioned our platform to offer customers the tools they need to manage risk effectively. In the U.K., for example, coal has been phased out of electricity generation. While across Asia, it remains a significant part of the mix to support rapid industrialization. At the same time, electricity prices are influenced by natural gas, whether active in oil, gas, carbon or a combination -- by providing access to these contracts through a single platform, we provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum to help customers manage increasingly interconnected pricing dynamics.\nThe value that our diverse, deep and liquid energy markets provides to customers contributed to another record volumes across our complex, driving our ninth consecutive quarter of record energy revenues. This strong performance is a testament to customers' continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice. With energy revenues up 24% in the first half and growing 13% on average over the past 5 years.\nIn our oil markets, Brent has become the world's most widely used benchmark, pricing roughly 3/4 of the world's internationally traded crude. Importantly, Brent stands as the cornerstone of a broader franchise that includes our Midland WTI, Platts Dubai and Middle East Murban grades of crude. These critical pricing relationships extend to refined oil products where ICE's low sulfur gas oil market similarly anchors price discovery for refined products globally. Together, these benchmarks form the foundation of a cohesive web of more than 800 related oil products developed by ICE, giving participants the ability to manage risk with precision across the oil value chain and around the world. These innovations have enabled us to continue to serve our global customers with record oil volumes in the first half, increasing 25% year-over-year, including records across Brent, WTI, Midland WTI and Platts Dubai, Murban and gas oil.\nIn our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook, establishing liquid markets in TTF, JKM, Henry Hub and North American basis markets. Offering a broad range of natural gas benchmarks with trading hubs across Europe, Asia and North America. As global LNG flows have increased and price relationships between regions have deepened, our TTF benchmark has emerged as the global reference point for gas pricing, much like Brent has for oil. This dynamic is illustrated by JKM execution patterns with roughly 60% of JKM volumes executed by the JKM TTF spread as participants draw assurance from TTF's deep liquidity to manage risk across an increasingly interconnected gas market.\nIn the second quarter, volumes in our global gas complex increased 14% versus the prior year, contributing to a record first half to deliver 27% revenue growth year-to-date, including 19% growth in the second quarter. The importance of the evolution of energy markets extends to our leading environmental markets, which work with our oil, natural gas, coal and power markets to provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum. Year-to-date, record volumes in our environmental portfolio are up 9% year-over-year, including 37% growth in our North American markets.\nIn summary, the guiding principle has been consistently to create a cohesive platform where customers can navigate complexity across markets. Our single platform model isn't just efficient it's essential for navigating an increasingly dynamic energy landscape. Participants can operate across markets with a broader view using tools that were developed not just in reaction trends but often in anticipation of them.\nTurning now to our fixed income and data services business on Slide 9. Driven by multiyear investments in both technology and data, our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, delivering another quarter of record revenues, which grew 5% year-over-year. Our high-quality evaluated prices provide mission-critical transparency for over 3 million global securities daily. Across our reference data business, we've improved the precision of our underlying data reduce the time to capture newly issued bonds and have continued to add to our coverage, thus providing a truly comprehensive offering. As a result, clients of our evaluated pricing business are increasingly drawn to the quality of our reference data. The quality of our pricing and reference data, combined with over 50 years of experience serves as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. Whether it's benchmark indices, analytics for unique solutions like our custom indices, ICE serve the entire ETF ecosystem.\nYear-to-date, revenue on our index business is up double digits, with passive ETF AUM benchmarked to ICE Indices growing to a record of $743 billion through the end of the second quarter. In our Data and Network Technology business, revenues were up 7% in the first half, driven by our ICE Global Network as well as continued demand for our Desktop and Feeds offerings. The ongoing investments in our ICE Global Network business and resulting growth reinforced its position as the gold standard for resiliency, latency and security. ICE Global Network securely connects participants to more than 750 data sources and more than 150 trading venues, including ICE and the NYSE exchanges.\nWithin our Desktops business, new clients are switching to ICE for the reliability of service, the quality of our data in the sheer range of data sources. Similarly, growth in our consolidated feeds business reflects investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering. Firms continue to seek more high-quality data from a range of different sources in a cost-effective manner. At the same time, they want access to new unique content and thus, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit. We've also added features to give latency sensitive clients additional confidence in the speed of our data. This with Data Services, together with its institutional customer connectivity is highly complementary to our ICE Bonds execution venues. These venues, which offer our customers choice of protocols, including auction, click-to-trade and request for quote, round out a broader fixed income offering.\nYear-to-date, revenues in our ICE Bonds business are up 12% versus the prior year and have grown 9% on average over the past 5 years. And [indiscernible], when we combine the long-tail secular trends such as the electronification of bond markets, workflow automation and the shift to passive investing, our comprehensive data offering is positioned to continue to deliver compounding growth well in the future. Shifting now to our Mortgage business on Slide 10.\nConsistent with our strategy to bring efficiencies to workflows, we are uniquely positioned to drive greater automation across the mortgage space. Such investments are critical not only to meet rising customer expectations for a digital-first experience, but also to have long-term operational efficiency and competitive positioning in an evolving mortgage landscape. For nearly a decade, ICE has been building an end-to-end digital mortgage platform that spans from customer acquisition all the way through to the secondary capital markets. This enables efficiency gains for our clients and bridges critical gaps between disparate systems. Our unified Mortgage Technology suite aims to simplify mortgage origination and refinancing into a single click process. streamlining processes for lenders while reducing costs, errors and time.\nThe opportunity for customers to acquire and retain more business starts with our industry-leading customer engagement suite. This end-to-end suite of sales, marketing and borrower engagement solutions unique to ICE and seamlessly integrated with our loan under writing platform provides mortgage lenders with an opportunity to scale their operations by efficiently identifying attracting and acquiring new customers while improving the ability to retain existing customers. By enabling lenders to target borrowers with the right products at the right time, it reduces the time and cost of acquisition.\nFlowing directly to the next phase of the mortgage workflow, our leading loan underwriting platform provides significant operational efficiencies. Here, we collect borrower data in any form. We digitized it, normalize it, and once harnessed enable lenders to leverage our AI tools to quickly and efficiently verify credit income and collateral as well as audit that the loan package meets underwriting requirements. This creates [indiscernible], uniformity and efficiency. We've also integrated our property tax, flood, closing fee and compliance-related information for borrowers and lenders. These various automation capabilities integrated into our loan underwriting platform are designed to provide customers with complete and automated underwriting process to help increase both frequency and velocity while reducing the cost of production. This is one of the many reasons we continue to add new clients to our platform. And as evidence to this, we have signed 43 new Encompass clients through the first half, 23 of which came from the second quarter alone.\nAs we move to the servicing stage of the loan, lenders have the opportunity to unlock additional value by utilizing ICE for their servicing technology needs. Our servicing platform has proven to be an industry standard and has a long history of dependability that servicers trust. Once originated, lenders can seamlessly transfer loans to our servicing technology or easily move loans acquired from other lenders that are on our technology, a functionality that has been enabled by the integration of our loan servicing technology with our underwriting system. Importantly, customers can trust the quality of the loan package through our automated quality control and audit capabilities, which enable servicers to quickly identify and remedy any critical information that may be missing from a long file as the data and documents progress through the process.\nBy integrating capabilities and data across mortgage origination and servicing, our platform creates opportunities for our lenders to provide more timely products to consumers. For example, lender servicers can now deliver a self-service home equity or refinance lending experience for their end consumer via an interconnected technology platform, effectively enabling them to quickly and efficiently compete for, recapture and retain clients, which should also improve the overall consumer experience while lowering their costs by matching the client to the right product at the right time. We also continue to find ways to leverage our industry-leading mortgage data to increase transparency in the secondary capital markets.\nFor example, in April, we launched a new RFQ protocol for mortgage-backed securities, taking another step to improve the MBS market. This new functionality sits along ICE bond's existing MBS click-to-trade marketplace. Later this year, ICE Bonds plans to integrate pricing and analytics from ICE Mortgage Technology to help traders make more informed trading decisions. Also, in the second half of this year, we plan to launch the first version of our secondary whole loan trading platform. This is designed to automate and provide significant efficiencies to what is today a very analog process.\nThe combination of [ IMT's ] data and community of customers provides us an opportunity to deliver unique innovations to our customers, such as our secondary whole loan trading and MBS execution on ICE Bonds.\nLastly, in June, we launched the ICE Average Prime Offer Rates Index, or ICE APOR, which represents the annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates points, fees and other terms on mortgages that are offered to consumers. For lenders, consumers and secondary market participants, the APOR is published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and must be used to determine whether the loan meets certain regulatory requirements, which can impact the terms of a mortgage and whether the loan qualifies for securitization.\nWith the CFPB's mandate and services under review, we launched the ICE APOR Index to provide another option for this service should the MBS market need an alternative.\nIn summary, on behalf of our clients, we've assembled an end-to-end platform that is operated by a neutral trusted third party in ICE, bringing together the key industry stakeholders from origination to final settlement in a single network ecosystem. We have a touchpoint to nearly every U.S. home mortgage connected to more than 3,000 lenders, 48,000 settlement agents and closing attorneys, 2,500 county governments the GSEs 80,000 notaries, 100 loan servicing companies, 1,000 mortgage-backed securities investment firms and thousands of third-party data and service providers who can now communicate with one another by a common data standard on a robust network operated under ICE's cyber overlay.\nOur comprehensive platform automates workflows throughout each stage of the mortgage life cycle, resulting in lower cost to originating service loans for our clients who can then pass those savings on to the end consumer, all while helping lenders and servicers better recapture and identify new business opportunities. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Please turn to Slide 11. In the second quarter, amidst the dynamic macro environment, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best quarter and the best first half in our company's history. Over the past 25 years, ICE has grown from a small Atlanta-based power exchange into a global data and technology company. The heart of our strategy has been to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. We do this by building and operating mission-critical digital networks that leverage our technology, data and expertise to connect our customers to opportunity around asset classes and around the globe. We connect these customers to our liquid energy markets to help manage risk, we connect entrepreneurs to capital at the New York Stock Exchange. We connect people to our Fixed Income Data to give them pre-trade and post-trade transparency. And we connect participants to one another in the mortgage space, to create more efficient transaction workflows.\nAs the world's leading energy marketplace, the breadth and diversity of our Global Commodity Platform drives an important network effect producing capital efficiencies for our customer base. In the second quarter, we saw record volumes and record revenues across our energy complex, contributing to an unsurpassed first half as market participants look to hedge exposures to geopolitical dynamics. Across our interest rate business, uncertainty on Central Bank policy, shifting trade policies and ongoing geopolitical tensions drove demand for our interest rate risk management.\nAs a result, in the first half, a record 462 million interest rate contracts traded on our platform, including records across our Euribor and [indiscernible] markets. This strong performance contributed to a 19% increase in revenues year-to-date, including 20% growth in the second quarter. At the New York Stock Exchange, our cash equity trading volumes increased 47% versus the prior year, while our equity options volume increased 5%. Similarly, in our credit default swap business Broad market volatility drove increased demand for credit protection with CDS notional cleared increasing 42% in the second quarter versus the prior year.\nIn summary, our record-setting first half results reflect the all-weather nature of our business model, where we've intentionally positioned the company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions, to facilitate all weather results. I'd like to end our prepared remarks today by thanking our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our best ever second quarter, following on the heels of our record first quarter, delivering an unsurpassed first half for the company.\nI'd now like to turn our call back to our moderator, Drew, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

My name is Lydia, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now hand you over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nInvestor Relations Analyst\n\nGood morning. ICE's first quarter 2025 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2024 Form 10-K 2025 first quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the prevailing GAAP terms in the earnings materials.\nWhen used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income & Data Services.\nI'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record first quarter results.\nFirst quarter earnings per share of $1.72 were up 16% year-over-year. These strong results were led by an 8% increase in net revenue to a record $2.5 billion. Importantly, against the backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, we saw growth across all 3 of our operating segments.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $964 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance range, driven in part by better-than-anticipated savings and synergies primarily related to technology spend. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted operating income increased by double digits, up 11% versus the prior year and reached a record $1.5 billion.\nThis strong business performance allowed us to return $519 million of capital to our shareholders during the quarter, including $241 million of share repurchases. And we did this while also investing in our business and reducing leverage, which ended the first quarter under 3.2x EBITDA.\nBefore I move to our segment results, I'll note a few guidance items. As we look to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $980 million to $990 million, with the increase versus the first quarter largely driven by a weaker dollar relative to the pound and euro, a dynamic that is more than offset by higher revenues, a full quarter of merit increases and an accrual for awards related to our strong year-to-date performance.\nSecond quarter nonoperating expense is expected to be between $175 million and $180 million, with slightly lower interest expense from reduced leverage, offset by the refinancing of our $1.25 billion maturity coming due in May.\nNow let's move to Slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of nearly $1 billion were up 16%, driven by an 18% increase in our interest rate business, 21% growth in NYSE cash equities and options revenues and another quarter of record energy revenues, which grew 23% year-over-year.\nIn addition, volumes accelerated in April, with energy ADV up 39%, interest rate ADV up nearly 60%, our cash equity ADV up 68% and our equity option ADV up 11%. And importantly, amidst rising volatility, open interest continues to build up 8% year-over-year, including 21% growth in global interest rates and 7% growth in our energy markets.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $368 million, up 3% year-over-year. Underpinning growth in our recurring revenues was our broader exchange data and connectivity services, which grew 5% as once again led by futures data services.\nIn our listings business, the NYSE helped to raise over $4 billion of new proceeds in the first quarter including Venture Global, the largest IPO year-to-date. It's worth noting that less than 40% of IPOs met the NYSE's listing standards in the first quarter, and these high standards remain a critical component of our 99%-plus retention rate. Additionally, the backlog for new IPOs remain strong with a variety of companies seeking to raise capital when volatility abates.\nTurning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $596 million, including transaction revenues of $125 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenue at ICE bonds increased by 16%, driven by 18% growth in our muni business and 30% growth in corporate bond trading.\nWithin our CDS business, revenues increased year-over-year with lower members' interest offset by clearing revenue, which increased 27% year-over-year amidst increasing macroeconomic uncertainty.\nRecurring revenues totaled a record $471 million and grew by 5% year-over-year. In our fixed income data and analytics business, revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in pricing and reference data and 14% growth in our index business, which reached a record $684 billion in ETF AUM as of the end of the first quarter. Data and network technology, which we previously referred to as other data and network services, increased by 7% in the first quarter, an acceleration from 5% growth in 2024. Growth was driven by the return on various data center investments we have recently made in our ICE Global Network as well as continued growth in our consolidated feeds business and strong performance across our desktop solutions, driven in part by cross-sell opportunities sourced from both our energy and NYSE customer bases.\nPlease flip to Slide 7 where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology results. First quarter revenues totaled $510 million, Recurring revenues totaled $397 million, up both sequentially and year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, the improvement was largely driven by our servicing business. And while we benefited from a $2 million of onetime revenue that we do not anticipate will repeat, growth was also driven by new customers implementing on MSP.\nTransaction revenues totaled $113 million, up slightly year-over-year, driven by revenue growth related to Encompass closed loans and applications, an increase in closing solution fees and higher default management revenues as foreclosure starts within our servicing business have begun to tick higher from historic lows.\nIn summary, we delivered record first quarter results including record revenues, operating income and adjusted EPS, building upon our record 2024. Amidst macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, we are uniquely positioned to invest across our business, meet the needs of our customers, and continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8.\nAmidst the dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data, and transparent and accessible markets to navigate uncertainty while managing risks.\nAcross our global futures markets, Total average daily volumes increased 23% to a record 10 million lots in the first quarter, including records across energy and interest rates. This strong performance drove record futures and options revenues, which grew 18% versus prior year. Building on the momentum of a strong first quarter, ADV into April was up 43% year-over-year, led by continued strength in our energy and interest rate franchise, up 39% and 59%, respectively. More importantly, open interest continues to trend higher, up 8% year-over-year. As we have consistently said, open interest is a helpful guide to gauging the health of our markets and proves to be a leading indicator of volume growth during volatile periods.\nFor over 2 decades, we've worked closely with our customers to develop a diverse, liquid and globally interconnected energy network. Today as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, our network provides the critical feedback loop required to address near-term supply and demand imbalances, as well as the long-term price signals needed to efficiently allocate the capital necessary to meet forward-looking demand.\nThis deliberate and long-term strategic direction contributed to our eighth consecutive quarter of record energy revenues, which increased 23% year-over-year, and that is on top of 32% growth achieved in last year's first quarter. This strong performance is a testament to customers' continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice.\nIn our oil markets, through constant innovation, Brent has firmly cemented itself as the global benchmark for crude oil, pricing roughly 3/4 of the world's internationally traded crude and from which prices are discovered in the U.S. Gulf Coast via ICE's WTI, and in the Middle East and in Asia via ICE's Murban and Dubai markets.\nIn the first quarter, record volume in our oil complex increased 18% year-over-year, including records across Brent, WTI, Midland PI, Murban and Platts Dubai. Collectively, this strong performance drove record oil revenues, which grew 17% year-over-year.\nIn addition, as a leading indicator of ongoing interest in our markets, open interest across the complex set a series of records in April. This growth signals that customers are managing more risk amid heightened volatility.\nIn our natural gas markets, we followed a similar playbook, building a platform that offers the broadest range of natural gas benchmarks across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia, underpinned by our liquid markets in Henry Hub and North American basis, TTF and JKM, a thoughtful approach that uniquely positions ICE to continue to benefit from both the near-term volatility and long-term growth trends occurring across these markets. Reflecting this dynamic, volumes and revenues in our global gas portfolio set records in the first quarter, both increasing 33% year-over-year.\nIn North America, we began preparing for the evolution of gas markets beyond the Henry Hub benchmark several years ago. Through close collaboration with our customers, we created our exclusive U.S. and Canadian basis markets, a suite of precise risk management tools that reflect the commercially relevant supply and demand dynamics of 70 distinct North American gas hubs.\nIn the first quarter, volumes in our Henry Hub contract grew 26% year-over-year, while record volumes in our basis markets increased 52%. The first quarter also included 9 of our top 10 all-time highest volume days. Collectively, the strong performance drove a 30% growth in our North American gas complex, including record options volumes.\nSimilarly, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends we began investing in more than a decade ago through our acquisition of Endex, an investment that positions us as a leader in European trading via our TTF contract. In more recent years, geopolitical shifts and a tight LNG market have intensified market globalization and increased the need for risk management. As a result, our TTF benchmark has asserted itself as -- its position as the Brent of natural gas markets and continues to be relied on by an increasing number of market participants.\nAt the same time, our TTF contract delivered another record-setting quarter across volume, revenues and open interest, with each growing double digits versus prior year. This record performance underscores TTF's deep liquidity and the critical role it plays in providing daily global natural gas price signals.\nAt the same time, the global transition to less carbon-intensive fuels supports demand growth for natural gas, particularly for developing economies which prioritize reliable, affordable fuel. For example, in Asia, where coal still accounts for roughly half of the region's energy supply, our JKM contract serves as the price benchmark for Asian natural gas and continues to reach important milestones with record volumes increasing 28%.\nAs policy discussions regarding sustainability objectives continue to evolve, our leading environmental markets work with our oil, natural gas, coal and power markets to provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum, transparency that is critical in navigating this multilayered and nonlinear progression. In the first quarter, our North American environmental markets traded again at record levels, contributing to a 15% volume growth in our environmental portfolio.\nIn summary, as the confluence of increasing energy demand, evolving supply chains and the energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility in the energy markets, we believe the markets we operate will prove instrumental as the long tail and complex evolution of global energy unfolds.\nTurning now to our Fixed Income & Data Services business on Slide 9. As fixed income markets automate and passive investing grows, our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, delivering another quarter of record revenues, which grew 5% year-over-year. Our decades-long position as a leading provider of price and reference data has served as the foundation for ICE to become one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. Here, growth continues to be fueled by growing demand for ETFs in their expanded role in markets with assets under management benchmarked to ICE indices growing to a record of $684 billion through the end of the first quarter. This strength once again drove double-digit revenue growth in our index business.\nWe also signed 2 additional licensing deals in the quarter with large global asset managers. One we'll move existing AUM to our index family and the other we'll launch a completely new ETF against our index solution.\nIn our data and network technology business, revenues increased 7% year-over-year, driven by continued demand of our desktop as well as our ICE global network and feeds offerings, as customers continue to modernize workflows and as past investments we've made continue to pay dividends.\nWithin our desktop business, revenues grew double digits in the quarter, including robust growth in our ICE Chat offering. Here, we continue to innovate to reduce friction across the workflow. A recent example of this innovation is the launch of ICE Voice, a cloud-based audio solution integrated directly with ICE Chat, providing market participants with real-time voice communication capabilities alongside chat functionality.\nSimilarly, growth in our ICE Global Network reflects ongoing data and technology investments we've made in that business, cementing its position as the gold standard for an ultra-secure, highly-resilient network.\nAcross ICE Bonds, which provide state-of-the-art execution technologies and rounds out a broader fixed income offering, providing solutions across the pre-trade, trade and post-trade workflow, revenues increased 16% versus prior year. Along with macroeconomic factors, this growth was also driven by past investments we've made to expand the number of participants accessing our trading platforms, driving liquidity to our markets.\nSimilarly, in our credit default swap clearing business, broad market volatility drove increased demand for credit protection, with CDS notional cleared increasing nearly 40% in the first quarter versus prior year. As we move forward, we will continue to expand and evolve the products and services that are the foundation of our Fixed Income & Data Services segment, another all-weather part of our business.\nShifting now to our mortgage business on Slide 10. For nearly a decade, we've been building a life-of-loan platform, an end-to-end network built and operated by a trusted neutral third party in ICE, that spans from customer acquisition all the way through to the secondary capital markets, including enhancing transparency for the over $12 trillion mortgage-backed securities market.\nOur neutral platform continues to attract the trust of significant customers across the mortgage landscape. And as evidence to this, 20 new Encompass clients were signed in Q1 alone and a significant new MSP client was signed in United Wholesale Mortgage.\nThis end-to-end mortgage journey begins with our industry-leading customer engagement suite, which helps lenders identify new customers while also reducing customer acquisition costs. Seamlessly integrated within our industry-leading loan underwriting platform, our comprehensive suite of sales, marketing and borrower engagement solutions leverages data and artificial intelligence to create effective marketing campaigns. These campaigns enable mortgage lenders to target borrowers with the right products at the right time and to educate and inform their customers throughout the origination process, reducing the time and cost to originate.\nThe process then moves into our leading loan underwriting platform, which provides significant operational efficiencies, collecting borrower data in any form, such as a portal, mobile phone, e-mail or scan, and then digitizing and normalizing the raw data. Once these raw data sets have been harnessed, it enables lenders to leverage our AI tools to quickly and efficiently verify credit, income and collateral as well as manage critical disclosures and underwriting requirements.\nHere we've also integrated our leading property tax flood closing fee and compliance-related information for borrowers and lenders, providing customers with a complete and automated underwriting experience.\nAt the same time, our robust and automated quality control and audit capabilities improves both the quality of the loan package, and as a result, its value.\nOnce originated, lenders can seamlessly transfer loans to our servicing technology, a functionality that has been enabled by the complete integration of our loan servicing technology with our underwriting system. Our quality control and audit capabilities assist customers in the rapid identification and remedy of critical information that may be missing from a loan file for servicing, reducing costs while continuing to produce a higher quality asset, and as loans mature or interest rates fluctuate, transmit near real-time data to the lender that owns the mortgage servicing right, enabling them to quickly and efficiently compete or recapture business.\nLastly, by combining these rich data sets with ICE's technology and data services expertise, we have developed tools that increase transparency for lenders, servicers in the capital markets. Here we're improving data quality and centralizing access with the goal of providing better pricing and prepayment modeling in the MBS market.\nCentral to this vision is a deep and broad footprint in mortgage data to support representative modeling. Our McDash loan-level data, for example, is driven by contributions from roughly 2/3 of all mortgage servicing firms. Over time, access to high-quality mortgage data should bolster confidence in investment decision-making, increasing sector participation, boosting liquidity and ultimately leading to lower cost for borrowers.\nIn this vein, we're pleased to have signed on a large global asset manager onto our McDash data offering in the first quarter, and our data is being implemented to drive their risk models.\nOn behalf of our clients, we're assembling, integrating and expanding a customer engagement suite, underwriting tools, pricing systems, closing tools, registration tools, servicing systems and the resulting data all within a single end-to-end platform. By using ICE's technology, mortgage lenders can lower mortgage origination costs while also relieving pain points across the workflow, all while helping lenders and servicers better recapture and identify new business opportunities.\nAnd we are seamlessly connecting our customers in these services so that they can now communicate with one another via a common data standard on a robust network operated by a neutral trusted third party in ICE.\nIn summary, as ICE continues to enhance our leading technology, we do so with both the client and end-consumer in mind. We are delivering on solutions that help automate workflows throughout each stage of the mortgage life cycle. This results in lower cost to originate and service loans for our clients who can then pass those savings on to the end consumer.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Please turn to Slide 11.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, marking the very best quarter in ICE's history. Our record results underscore the quality of our all-weather business model and the value of our products, leading technology and mission-critical data.\nWe've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues, to give revenue upside exposure to investors while hedging our downside risk. We placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing analog-to-digital conversions. We've mixed our footprint between financial markets, which react to central bank acts of man and physical markets, which react to disrupted supply chain acts of God. We've diversified our global footprint because at all times, somewhere in the world, there are risks that our customers and our potential customers need to manage.\nWe believe the combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.\nAcross our futures and options markets, first quarter volume and revenue represented the highest quarter in ICE's history, with volume increasing 23% to deliver 18% revenue growth over the prior year. This record performance is strong evidence of the ever-growing need for global risk management as our customers continue to turn to ICE to manage risk across the thousands of contracts offered on our platform. Our open interest is up 8% year-over-year.\nThese results illustrate that during recent high levels of market volatility, market participants are managing risk by adding to their positions and not leaving.\nAs the world's leading energy marketplace, the breadth and the diversity of our global platform drives an important network effect producing capital efficiencies for our customer base. Our record first quarter operating results underscore the significance of our energy offering, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of record energy revenues, which increased 23% versus the prior year.\nWe continue to see strong energy trading volumes to start the second quarter as market participants look to hedge exposures to geopolitical dynamics. This includes the single highest energy trading day ever experienced on ICE with nearly 10 million energy contracts traded on April 4, yielding records across our total oil business and our Brent benchmark contract.\nAt the same time, total energy open interest is up 7% year-over-year, with our oil complex setting a series of records in April. We see strong open interest trends in our Brent benchmark contract, highlighting its deep liquidity and diverse global participant base, which becomes particularly important in times of market stress.\nGoing forward, the new U.S. administration has pledged to increase energy production, which could further reorder the global energy supply chain and, thereby, the global risk that may need to be managed on our platform.\nAcross ICE's interest rate markets, a mixed inflation picture, ongoing political tensions and shifting trade policies are driving demand for interest rate risk management. As a result, we captured the highest quarterly volume in our company's history, which increased 31% versus the prior year and included records across our Euribor and SONIA markets, the most liquid benchmarks for European and U.K. interest rates, respectively.\nIn addition, across our Gilts market, which is the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve, volume increased 8% in the first quarter, including 12% growth in March. Our Gilts open interest is up 62% year-over-year. Collectively, these results highlight the strength of our multicurrency interest rate franchise with overall open interest building to a 21% year-over-year increase.\nAt the New York Stock Exchange, our cash equity trading volumes increased 20% year-over-year, and our equity options volumes increased 8% year-over-year. Collectively, this strength provided 21% growth in our equity trading revenues.\nImportantly, and against the backdrop of economic volatility, our state-of-the-art technology provided investors with efficient venues to digest global events, make investment decisions and execute trades with unrivaled speed and accuracy. We saw equity and equity option trades execute more efficiently in this period than during the volatile COVID outbreak, handling all-time high volumes and messaging rates. Our technology systems rose to the occasion, twice processing more than 1 trillion messages in a single day, with a median processing time of roughly 30 microseconds.\nThe New York Stock Exchange's opening and closing auctions grew more than 20%. They handle over $37 billion in trading activity per day. When combined with our designated market maker model, we provide a differentiated execution experience for our issuers that reduces volatility, provides tighter bid offer spreads and offers an all-in cost of capital that is significantly lower than average. This flexibility, which is unique to our model, has fostered great engagement from the market participants, and it further solidifies the New York Stock Exchange as the trusted risk management source during times of market volatility.\nAnd we're pleased to extend our footprint to the State of Texas with our newly launched Texas Exchange, which has been incredibly well received by our issuer community.\nAs we move through the balance of the year and beyond, we remain focused on continuing to enhance the scale, resiliency and reliability of the ecosystem surrounding our market-leading platforms and risk management products. I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their continued trust in this company. And I wish to thank my colleagues at ICE for their remarkable efforts in contributing to the very best quarter in our company's history, and importantly, for supporting our customers who now more than ever place trust in our people and technology to manage risk across asset classes around the world.\nI'd like to now turn the call back to our moderator, Lydia, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, which will go until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time."

My name is Lydia, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now hand you over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nInvestor Relations Analyst\n\nGood morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2024 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the prevailing GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income & Data Services.\nI'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record 2024 results.\nFull year adjusted earnings per share totaled $6.07, an increase of 8% year-over-year, marking the best year in our company's history. For the full year, net revenues totaled a record $9.3 billion. And pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased by 6% versus last year.\nFull year adjusted operating expenses totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of roughly 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. It's worth noting that in just 16 months following the close of Black Knight, we have achieved run rate expense synergies of $175 million and now expect to reach our full synergy target of $200 million by the end of 2025. In addition, we are also raising our Black Knight expense synergy target to $230 million. This strong performance drove record full year adjusted operating income of $5.5 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year.\nMoving to cash generation. This record operating performance contributed to full year free cash flow of $3.6 billion, of which we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends while also reducing our leverage to under 3.3x EBITDA versus 4.3x upon the close of Black Knight in late 2023. As a result of the significant progress we have made on levered, we now expect to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter. Recall that we expect -- recall that we still expect and are on track to achieve leverage levels of approximately 3x EBITDA. And we will balance share repurchases with continued deleveraging until we reach this target, which we expect will occur later this year.\nMoving to Slide 5, I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.52, up 14% versus last year. Fourth quarter net revenues of $2.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year, driven by transaction revenues of $1.1 billion and recurring revenues of $1.2 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $973 million, $4 million below the low end of our guidance range driven by reduced marketing and legal spend as well as lower customer acquisition costs at the NYSE.\nNow let's move to Slide 6, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $1.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $883 million were up 13%, in part driven by record revenues across interest rates in our global energy business, which grew 38% and 16% year-over-year, respectively.\nRevenues within our global oil complex increased 11% year-over-year, while natural gas and environmental products, which represent nearly half of our energy revenues, increased by 22% in the quarter and were up 31% for the full year.\nIn addition, 2025 is off to a strong start with January volumes increasing 21% year-over-year and total open interest up 11% year-over-year, including 13% growth in global energy and 17% growth in our interest rate business.\nRecurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, totaled $353 million. The sequential decline in exchange data services was largely driven by a onetime full year true-up to our tape revenues at the NYSE, which we do not anticipate will repeat in 2025. As a result, we expect that exchange data and connectivity services revenues will rebound to $240 million to $245 million range in the first quarter.\nIn our listings business, while less than half of global IPOs met the standards to list on our exchange in 2024, the NYSE helped to raise $17 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 53 new operating companies, including 7 of the top 10 IPOs and 9 of the top 10 best-performing IPOs.\nLooking to 2025, we expect that recurring revenues in our Exchange segment will grow in the low single-digit range, largely driven by continued growth in our futures data services.\nTurning now to Slide 7, I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $579 million, including transaction revenues of $108 million. Within ICE Bonds, lower tax loss harvesting activity relative to 2023 within our muni business offset growth in institutional corporates, while strong CDS clearing activity was offset by lower levels of member interest following 2 Fed cuts towards the end of 2024.\nRecurring revenues totaled a record $471 million and grew by 5% year-over-year. In our fixed income data and analytics business, record fourth quarter revenues of $301 million increased by 5% driven by growth in pricing and reference data and another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business.\nOther data and network services revenues also increased by 5% in the fourth quarter driven by continued growth for both ICE Global Network and our consolidated feeds offering as well as continued strength in our desktop solutions.\nLooking to 2025 and supported by an [ ASV ] that exits the fourth quarter up 5% year-over-year, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in our Fixed Income & Data Services recurring revenues.\nPlease flip to Slide 8 where I'll discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $508 million, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recurring revenues totaled $391 million. While down on a year-over-year basis, revenues improved relative to the third quarter, driven by growth in both our servicing solutions and our data and analytics business.\nSimilar to prior quarters, while the majority of Encompass customers renewed at higher minimums, the improvement in recurring revenues was somewhat offset by customers that reduced minimums at renewal.\nTransaction revenues totaled $117 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis, but, as anticipated, were down slightly relative to the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. a dynamic that typically impacts both the fourth and first quarter of each year. It's worth noting that according to ICE Mortgage Technology, we continue to see signs of market stabilization as housing inventory continues to rise, up 20% in 2024, and annual home price appreciation slowed to the lowest levels since 2011.\nMoving to guidance for 2025. We anticipate that total IMT revenues will grow in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range. The high end of the range is underpinned in part by low teens growth in industry origination volumes, which is similar to expectations set by the MBA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, where the low end of the range assumes a more conservative origination backdrop that is flat with 2024 levels. At both ends of the range, we anticipate growth in recurring revenues due in part to a portion of the $55 million in total revenue synergies we have achieved beginning to come online.\nPlease flip to Slide 9 where I'll provide some additional full year guidance. We expect 2025 adjusted operating expenses to be between $3.915 billion and $3.965 billion, an increase of roughly 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Similar to prior years, we expect to invest in our people, our technology and growth initiatives across our business, with these investments somewhat offset by synergies related to Black Knight.\nMoving below the line. Similar to last year, we currently expect the full year tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 26%. And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $730 million to $780 million. As is typical in the case in the years following an acquisition, CapEx is expected to be slightly elevated as we invest and reposition the acquired asset. In addition to these IMT-related investments, we will also make revenue-related investments in our datacenter footprint to meet growing customer demand for additional capacity.\nIn summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year of revenues, operating income and free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. We invested across our business while also significantly reducing our leverage. As we kick off 2025, we're focused on, once again, delivering growth and creating shareholder value.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A., but for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 10.\nAcross our futures markets, we've worked for over 2 decades to build out the scope and depth of our multi-asset and multi-geography offering to allow for both flexibility and precision trading from wherever in the world customers choose to trade on ICE. As a result, a record of over 2 billion futures and options contracts traded on ICE in 2024, marking the highest volume year in ICE's history, including a record $1.2 billion commodity contracts and a record $753 million interest rate contracts. This strong performance contributed to the 12th consecutive year of record futures revenue in 2024, which grew 20%, including 15% in the fourth quarter.\nAcross our energy markets, we saw the importance of investing in a diverse and globally interconnected energy platform that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. By working closely with our customers, we have built and continued to enhance our leading global energy network that delivers comprehensive risk management solutions, provides capital efficiencies and is positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets. All this while providing the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to navigate the energy transition and to meet forward-looking demand.\nOver the last 5 years, revenue growth across our energy markets has averaged 14% growth annually, with 2024 revenues reaching a record $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by record energy volumes and is a testament to customers' continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice.\nIn our oil business, we offer key benchmark contracts such as Brent. As the global benchmark for crude oil, Brent prices roughly 3/4 of the world's internationally traded crude and serves as the cornerstone of our global oil complex which today includes over 800 locational and product spreads relied on by commercial customers. This innovation and evolution have enabled us to continue serving our global customers and to drive growth across the business, delivering record oil revenues in 2024, which grew 21% year-over-year. This strong performance was underpinned by the highest volume year for total oil contracts traded on ICE, including records across our Brent and gas oil benchmark contracts.\nIn addition, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers not only are seeking liquidity in the major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide greater hedging precision. This dynamic is illustrated by record trading activity in our other crude and refined products in 2024 with volumes up 34% year-over-year, including records across our Platts Dubai and Murban contracts.\nOur global oil offering sits alongside our global natural gas markets where the globalization of this commodity is underpinned by the rise of liquefied natural gas or LNG. The ongoing liberalization of the LNG market has put more natural gas in motion over longer distances with a greater number of touch points along the value chain from production to consumption.\nAt the same time, demand for natural gas continues to grow and likely sustainably for the foreseeable future. Trends that support this are the undeniable secular growth in overall energy demand, increased demand for datacenters and the associated power that goes with it and the move to gas as a cleaner fossil fuel source versus coal. In essence, this evolution creates opportunities for new trading relationships to develop and adds an extra layer of complexity that fuels adoption to our global gas product suite. This was illustrated by record market participation in our global gas complex in 2024, which has increased nearly 30% since 2019.\nAs supply chains evolve and globalize, the quality of our expansive range of benchmarks is evident, with our natural gas business delivering another year of record revenues in 2024, increasing 30% versus last year. This strong performance was led by record revenues in our Title Transfer Facility benchmark, or TTF, which we have positioned as the Brent of natural gas, and plays a critical role in providing global natural gas price signals. As a result, TTF continues to be relied upon by an increasing number of market participants with market participation and volumes both setting new highs in 2024 and each growing double digits on average over the past 5 years.\nIn Asia, where coal still accounts for nearly half of the region's energy supply, our Japan-Korea Marker, JKM, has seen market participation grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, reaching a record in 2024 and increasing 27% year-over-year. As a cleaner alternative to coal, natural gas has accelerated the global risk management needs related to the commodity and caused the markets across North America, Europe and Asia to become increasingly interconnected. This dynamic was once again highlighted by JKM volume execution trends in the fourth quarter with 2/3 of JKM volume executed via the JKM-TTF spread.\nIn North America, as market participants continue to gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for the liquidity ICE offers in longer-dated tenors, along with the linkage to our exclusive regional basis markets, volumes in our complex grew 30% year-over-year, including record volumes across our basis markets, which spans 70 hubs across North America, allowing customers to manage regional supply and demand dynamics.\nTrading alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, our leading environmental markets, which were first launched nearly 2 decades ago, provide customers price transparency across the energy spectrum that is critical in navigating the clean energy transition. Here we've seen market participation grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in 2024, up 13% versus prior year. At the same time, record volumes across the complex were up 39% year-over-year, led by another record-setting year in our North American environmental markets. These record volumes represent the equivalent of over $1 trillion in notional value for the fourth consecutive year and contributed to a 40% increase in environmental revenues in 2024 versus the prior year.\nIn summary, the evolution of our energy markets is one example of how we continuously invest and develop customer-driven solutions across asset classes to drive value creation. Our record performance is a product of these investments, some that we've made more than a decade ago.\nTurning now to our Fixed Income & Data Services business on Slide 11. Driven by multiyear investments in both technology and data, our comprehensive fixed income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth. Our position as a leading provider of price and reference data has served as the foundation for many innovative solutions such as our rapidly-growing index franchise, a business we built through both organic and inorganic investments, including our acquisitions of IDC and the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Index platform.\nIn 2024, revenues in our index business increased double digits year-over-year. A key driver was growth in ETF assets under management benchmarked to ICE indices, up 13% year-over-year. Collectively, the strong performance across our PRD and index business drove 5% growth in our fixed income data and analytics business in 2024.\nIn addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business, which grew 5% in 2024 versus prior year. As an example, within our consolidated fees business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering, including commodity and energy data, now available on our feeds, has led to accelerating adoption by large financial institutions, including displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents. This was a key contributor to the high single-digit revenue growth in this area in 2024. With content from over 600 data sources as firms seek more high-quality data from a range of different sources in a cost-effective manner and access to new unique content, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit.\nFinally, as we move forward, we remain focused on continuing to leverage our deep expertise in gathering and cleansing unstructured data to develop actionable insights and add transparency not only to the fixed income markets but across asset classes. For example, in 2024, we announced the integration of our property and loan level mortgage datasets with our property level climate risk metrics, covering more than 100 million U.S. homes. This solution improves transparency and facilitates risk management throughout the housing finance and property insurance sector, allowing customers to apply ICE's climate metrics to individual loans, properties and entire portfolios, improving the visibility to the inherent climate risks in each.\nWe also went live with our MBS Mortality Indicator, which leverages datasets across ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology to produce daily trading signals for more than 900,000 agency and residential MBS pools.\nShifting now to our mortgage business on Slide 12. Like our exchanges and fixed income businesses, ICE Mortgage Technology's products and network excel by offering a value proposition that enables efficiency gains for our customers. We target asset classes that are in the early stages of an analog-to-digital conversion because we believe these asset classes will benefit from greater automation and create strong network effects.\nThis is no different in mortgage where we've constructed an unparalleled network that seamlessly connects key industry stakeholders within a single end-to-end digital ecosystem. That kind of connectivity in network is a hallmark of the ICE business model and one that, combined with our leading solutions, gives us confidence that we can grow a business that, at $2 billion today, is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of an analog-to-digital conversion.\nIn 2024, we continued to make progress on the successful integration of Black Knight and executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies across the mortgage workflow. Starting with Encompass. We closed on 38 client wins in the fourth quarter as customers focused on modernizing their infrastructure and our workflow efficiencies. And to kick off the year, we're pleased to announce that Flagstar and Howard Hanna have signed on as Encompass clients.\nIn parallel, we delivered on several enhancements to Encompass during last year, including the launch of multichannel support for web-based loan manufacturing, and are pleased to see clients are adopting this innovation. We also unified our industry-leading marketing and sales automation solutions into one complete customer acquisition and retention suite. We also added a borrower-facing mobile application to support lenders on our platform. Then we embedded these into Encompass workflows directly, enabling our lender clients to efficiently identify customers to target with the right products at the right time and manage their leads through to closing. This helped to drive over 200 cross-sells of our customer acquisition suite into Encompass customers in 2024. Along the same lines, we integrated datasets from Black Knight into Encompass, including property tax, flood and closing fees, providing customers with more choice of service providers on our platform, and are pleased by the early traction across these offerings, executing on over 400 data cross-sells to Encompass clients in 2024.\nAlong the same lines and consistent with our approach of investing ahead of secular growth, throughout 2024, we dramatically enhanced our ICE Product and Pricing Engine, or PPE, and look forward to showcasing this enhanced offering at our upcoming ICE Experience event, an annual gathering of thousands of customers where each year we launch our new and enhanced innovations for our clients.\nFor MSP, roughly 80% of new client wins during the year were cross-sells to Encompass clients. We also continued to make significant strides in enhancing functionality designed to elevate customer interactions and experiences, including the rollout of our MSP digital experience or MSP DX. At the same time, we enhanced and integrated our loss mitigation, customer service and collections capabilities. These embedded tools within MSP not only streamline operations, but help clients prepare for the eventual increase in defaults and foreclosures.\nOur customer service enhancements improved the customer experience. And as an example, our call prediction functionality uses artificial intelligence to analyze the account and provide a prediction of why the customer is calling, allowing the customer service agent to reach a resolution in decreased timeframe and reduce friction to the homeowner.\nLastly, our Actionable Intelligence Platform, or AIP, which is in the process of being rebranded as ICE Business Intelligence, provides robust analytical and reporting capabilities based on configurable suites for originators and servicers. Originators will be able to view dashboards to manage all aspects of production, including marketing, sales, pipelines and closing through all channels, including retail, wholesale and correspondent. Servicers will have sophisticated risk management, compliance and capacity planning tools that will help them better manage portfolios and coordinate activities across the enterprise.\nBy delivering timely and actionable insights, our Business Intelligence platform will help enable financial institutions to stay agile and competitive in a continually evolving market, all while seamlessly integrating with existing systems for ease of adoption. In that regard, we are pleased to announce that we signed a top 5 depository onto this service in 2024, and we continue to see other clients engaged in this solution suite based on the efficiencies and revenue opportunities it can help uncover.\nIn summary, we are pleased to see the value of our comprehensive platform is resonating in the marketplace, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 13.\nOver 2 decades ago, we launched Intercontinental Exchange, a name we chose to reflect our vision of better serving global markets, with a mission to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. The pursuit and execution of this vision first led us to energy markets, where at the time of our 2005 IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, we were purely an energy exchange, offering only a handful of products and on track to generate what would ultimately be $156 million in total revenue.\nOur goal then, as it remains today, was to build a platform that operated on a global scale and which had the asset class breadth to enable us to quickly and efficiently chase growth opportunities as they emerge around the world. In the years since, our focus on leading technology, customer-driven product innovation and operating efficiency has remained core to our strategy. We've built new technology from scratch, acquired old technology and refurbished it, and innovated all along the way, developing countless new products and content that seamlessly flow through a global distribution platform, enabling us to build on the success of our core businesses while looking ahead to new opportunities.\nIn many ways, this is how we built what I often refer to as our all-weather business model, one that drives growth on top of growth through an array of economic, political and regulatory environments, with 2024 marking our 19th consecutive year of record revenues, increasing 16% year-over-year to $9 billion. Through deliberate organic and inorganic investments that we've made, some more than a decade ago and others in more recent years, such as our Midland HOU contract, our leading global energy network today spans more than 2,000 contracts. It's a business that, as you've just heard, continues to flourish more than 20 years later, with revenues tripling since 2010 to a record $1.9 billion in 2024, an increase of 25% year-over-year on top of 28% prior annual growth.\nBuilding on our energy business as the foundation, we targeted an interrelated collection of markets to create a global risk management powerhouse that helps our customers manage risks associated to both acts of nature, such as issues that affect commodity supply chain flows, and acts of man, such as central bank and cross-border trade policies.\nIn 2013, through the acquisition of the London International Financial Futures Exchange, known as LIFFE, and subsequently combining it with our own local commodity exchange and clearing house, we broadened our offering to manage the risk resulting from both types of forces. And in 2024, our commodity markets as well as our interest rate derivatives complex all traded at record levels. highlighting the key role that these contracts continue to play for global market participants.\nAcross our interest rate contract portfolio, diverging rate paths by central banks was a consistent theme throughout 2024, contributing to record revenues, which increased 30% versus 2023, including 38% growth in the fourth quarter. These results highlight the strength of our multicurrency European, U.K. and Swiss interest rate markets, including the key benchmarks Euribor, SONYA, SARON and Gilts.\nIn 2015, our acquisition of IDC proved to be instrumental and laid the foundation for our move into fixed income markets and the development of a comprehensive platform that has since evolved into nearly 500 unique institutional-grade data products, one that continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and as passive investing grows.\nIn our index business, ETF AUM benchmarked to our indices has grown to $648 billion at the end of 2024 from less than $100 billion in 2017, a key driver of the double-digit average annual revenue growth over that timeframe.\nFixed income and its related data is an area where we continue to make strategic decisions to position ourselves for success. For example, in 2024, we announced our intention to launch a clearing service for all U.S. treasury securities and repurchase agreements, leveraging our infrastructure and expertise in centralized clearing. And in early January, we announced our acquisition of the American Financial Exchange, or AFX, an electronic exchange for direct lending and borrowing for American banks and financial institutions. AFX has focused on regional, midsized and community bank customers, covering many of the same customers that we serve through our Mortgage Technology network, making AFX a natural fit at ICE and complementing both our mortgage network and ICE's growing index business.\nAcross our mortgage business, much like our strategy in other asset classes, we're leveraging our data, technology and collective expertise to bring efficiencies to the entire mortgage manufacturing workflow. And as Ben pointed out, we continue to make strides executing against this strategy, digitizing the workflow from homebuyer identification all the way through to the capital markets. In 2024, we added many new clients to the mortgage network while also deepening relationships with our long-standing customers.\nAs we look to 2025 and beyond, the new U.S. administration has pledged to increase U.S. energy production, which could change the supply chain dynamics of the world's energy supply, and, resultingly, the global risk that will need to be managed. We believe that energy demand growth, particularly in Asia, the power deregulation trends in Japan, increases in U.S. energy exports and the multi-decade nonlinear energy transition, all point to the growing use of market-based commodity pricing and risk management tools.\nAnd with new governments in the U.K. and EU Commission, as well as in the U.S., we expect novel policy decisions that will impact inflation and employment, which could drive continued demand for interest rate risk management in 2025.\nAlso when thinking about the current robust AI investment environment, particularly in the U.S., coupled with uncertain central bank interest rate policies and the potential demands for energy by this sector, these trends could further the need for commodity risk management while continuing to stimulate trading in equity markets.\nFrom helping our customers navigate the long-tail evolution of commodity markets to the digitization of fixed income workflows and automating mortgage placement, it's our operating expertise, leading technology infrastructure and forward thinking that underpin the quality of the network that we operate, proving to be our competitive advantage and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across customers and our own business units.\nWe believe that we're better positioned than ever to capitalize on these secular and cyclical trends across asset classes, and we remain focused on investing and executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us.\nIn summary, for more than 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. In that vein, 2024 marked our 19th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. This consistent record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest industries undergoing analog-to-digital conversions, a strategy that has created an all-weather business model that is well positioned to continue to drive growth as it has for every year since we've been a public company.\nI'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2024, and I want to thank my colleagues for the efforts that contributed to yet another record year at ICE.\nI'll now turn our call back to our moderator, Lydia, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time."

My name is Drew, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nInvestor Relations Analyst\n\nGood morning. ICE's second quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K, 2024 second quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent governments in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis.

I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record results. Second quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first half of 2024. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $947 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 11% versus the prior year, reaching a record $1.4 billion, with record adjusted earnings per share totaling $1.52.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Adjusted leverage ended the second quarter at approximately 3.7x pro forma EBITDA, a reduction from 3.9x at the end of the first quarter and 4.3 upon the completion of Black Knight in the third quarter of 2023. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few third quarter guidance items. We expect third quarter adjusted expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million or, at the midpoint, an increase of roughly 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with growth across our Exchange and FID segments, largely offset by dissynergies, which we now anticipate will exit 2024 at an annualized run rate of over $150 million, up from prior expectations of $135 million.\nRelative to the second quarter, we expect the sequential increase to be driven by higher occupancy costs, slightly higher compensation, including an accrual for our strong performance year-to-date, and higher depreciation expense as revenue-related data center investments continue to come online. Moving below the line, adjusted nonoperating expense is expected to be between $190 million to $195 million, driven by lower interest expense, as we continue to direct free cash flow to reducing debt outstanding. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchanges segment.\nSecond quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $884 million were up 20%, driven by a 40% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 33% year-over-year. This strong energy performance included a 30% increase in our rural complex, 32% growth in global natural gas revenues and 64% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of July, open interest is up 20% year-over-year, including 21% growth in global interest rates and 25% growth in our energy markets.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $362 million in the second quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in our broader Exchange data services was underpinned by high single-digit growth in futures data, in part driven by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network.\nIn our listings business, SPAC delistings rolling off from 2021 admission fees offset a solid quarter for new listings. Through the first half and despite only half of IPOs eligible to list, the NYSC has helped raise $12 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 30 new operating companies, including 7 of the top 10 IPOs. Absent a sharp recovery in IPOs in the second half, we would expect listings revenues to trend around current levels through the balance of this year.\nTurning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $565 million. Transaction revenues totaled $108 million. Transaction revenue growth at ICE bonds was once again driven by strong [indiscernible] across both corporates and munis, particularly our institutional channel, which grew double digits year-over-year.\nRecord recurring revenues totaled $457 million and grew by 5% year-over-year, slightly ahead of expectations. In our Fixed Income Data & Analytics business, record second quarter revenues of $293 million increased by 6% year-over-year and was driven by growth in pricing and reference data, another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business and higher-than-anticipated onetime revenue.\nOther data and network services grew 5% in the second quarter, driven by our consolidated feeds business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which are products that we have invested in organically, enhancing both content and functionality. Total ASV or annual subscription value exited the quarter up 4% year-over-year. Coupled with visibility into our sales pipeline for the balance of this year and assuming flat markets, we are on track to grow total Fixed Income & Data Services recurring revenue around the middle of our mid-single-digit guidance range, an improvement from 3% growth in 2023.\nPlease flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss the results of our Mortgage Technology segment. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $506 million in the second quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. Relative to the first quarter, revenue from new customers coming online was offset by attrition within our data and document automation product, or DDA, and was primarily related to non-encompass customer on our legacy platform who was not utilizing DDA's full capabilities.\nDespite this attrition, quarterly sales of DDA were the strongest since early 2022, including the signing of JPMorgan, a current owner of DDA on the origination side, to utilize the platform for their servicing business. A win that is a testament to past investments in synergies in MSP. In addition, while the majority of customers continue to renew at higher minimums, similar to the last [ few ] quarters, we also sell customers for new lower. It's important to note that lower minimums are paired with a higher transaction fee or price per closed loan. And net total contract, assuming normal market conditions continues to increase upon renewal.\nTransaction revenues totaled $119 million in the second quarter. While revenues related to Encompass closed loans, applications and MERS registrations increased in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis, and increased well into the double digits sequentially, growth was offset by transaction revenues related to the aforementioned D&A attrition as well as lower default management revenues within our servicing business.\nWhile the mortgage origination market is trending below historical levels and refinance can be difficult to predict, we are seeing encouraging signs that fundamentals are stabilizing. According to [indiscernible] mortgage technology data, while still below pre-COVID levels, the number of homes on the market continues to grow, up nearly 40% versus this time last year. In addition, stable home equities hit record levels at the end of June, reaching $11.5 trillion, with over 30 million homeowners with at least $100,000 to drop that upon.\nAnd we estimate that the number of borrowers with an incentive to refinance the current rate is at its highest level in 2 years, driven by slightly lower interest rates and a building backlog of higher rate purchase loans. And so we continue to invest in product development enhancement, and we continue to expand our existing network, all which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when conditions normalize.\nIn summary, we delivered a record first half. We once again delivered revenue growth, operating income growth and free cash flow growth. We continue to invest across our business to meet the needs of our customers, and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. In the more than 20 years ICE has been building its global energy platform, we have strategically positioned our energy business for the globalization of natural gas and the societal demand for a transition to clean energy. Our long-term strategic direction and the value of our diverse, deep and liquid markets contributed to record trading volumes across our energy complex in the second quarter. This was a key driver to another quarter of record energy revenues up 33% year-over-year and growing double digits on average over the past 5 years.\nThis strong performance is a testament to customers' continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice. And with open interest continuing to set records into July, up [ 25% ] year-over-year, our energy complex appears poised for continued strength. As the world evolves, market participants are constantly adjusting and weighing the price impact of an array of macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory forces, as well as externalities, such as climate risk and the emergence of new renewable fuel sources. In essence, the price portion process is increasingly becoming more complex, and that additional complexity is driving customer demand for more precise risk management tools.\nIt is also driving demand for customers to come to a single place to manage risk across oil, gas, power and environmentals because of the efficiency and deep liquid markets that we provide. On natural gas, the evolution of a global market is accelerating. This acceleration is underpinned by the rise of liquefied natural gas, market-based pricing and, more recently, Europe's renewed openness to gas imports after the elimination of Russia as a key supplier and the emergence of North America as a leading natural gas exporter.\nAlongside this, as an important partner fuel, emitting about half as much carbon dioxide as coal to produce, natural gas continues the benefit of demand for cleaner fuels as countries move to reduce their carbon emissions. Additionally, the natural gas markets were historically regional-oriented, each characterized by distinct pricing and supply dynamics. All these factors underpin the emergence of 3 key benchmarks for natural gas across North America, Europe and Asia, with these becoming increasingly interconnected.\nIn Europe, our Title Transfer Facility contract, or TTF, is essential trading point for natural gas, just as Brent is the global benchmark for oil pricing. As a result, TTF is increasingly being used by global commercial participants, traders and investors, with a record number of market participants in the second quarter that had doubled since 2019. This has been accompanied by volumes and open interest increasing, with both setting new highs in the second quarter and each are growing double digits on average over the past 5 years.\nIn Asia, our Japan Korea Marker, or JKM, reflects the spot market value of cargoes delivered into the region that represents a key demand center for LNG, underpinned by surging economic growth and increasing focus on environmental concerns. In 2023, global coal consumption reached its highest level in history, driven by continued growth in Asia. While coal continues to be replaced by natural gas and other cleaner energy sources in Europe and North America, it still accounts for 47% of primary energy consumption in Asia. In absolute terms, the coal-switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources.\nICE's JKM volumes have shifted from being roughly 50% composed of the JKM TTF spread, [indiscernible] and relying on TTF as a benchmark for global gas and LNG prices as participants draw assurance from its deep liquidity, rather than relying on the Asian marker in isolation.\nIn North America, we began preparing for the liberalization of natural gas and its evolution beyond the Henry Hub benchmark more than a decade ago. Through close collaboration with our customers, we created ICE's electronic regional basis markets, a suite of precise risk management tools, reflecting the commercially relevant supply and demand dynamics of 70 hubs across North America. These hubs are priced at a differential to Henry Hub to reflect U.S. regional market conditions, transportation costs and transmission capacity between locations.\nAlongside this, many market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas price dynamics gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for liquidity and the linkage to our exclusive thesis markets. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shifts to cleaner energy sources all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics underpinning the strong momentum for this business. and we see these trends continuing to favor our global gas complex well into the future.\nThe importance of the evolving energy markets extends to our global environmental markets, where the number of market participants has nearly doubled since 2019, setting an all-time high in the second quarter and increasing 18% year-over-year. At the same time, volumes increased 6% in the quarter, including growth across our regional greenhouse gas initiative allowances, California carbon allowances, as well as our EU and U.K. allowances. This strong performance has contributed to a 43% increase in environmental revenues year-to-date, including 64% growth in the second quarter.\nIn parallel, across our power markets, volumes increased 32% in the first half, including 51% growth in the second quarter. With AI and data center build-outs expected to drive meaningful power demand into the next decade, our platform is uniquely positioned to capture this tailwind and help market participants manage this potentially volatile growth story given that ICE is the most comprehensive platform that offers U.S. regional gas markets, alongside deep and liquid power and environmental markets.\nIn summary, for market participants seeking to manage their risk, ICE's global energy platform offers over 1,000 futures and options contracts across natural gas, power, environmental and oil markets, supporting the growing complexity of energy markets and uniquely positioning us to benefit from both near-term volatility and secular growth trends occurring across these markets.\nMoving to our Fixed Income & Data Services business. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with over 40 years of price history serve as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. Year-to-date, revenue in our index business is up double digits, with passive ETF assets under management benchmarked to our industry and doubling since 2020. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made to enhance content and functionality of our other data and network services business.\nAs an example, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have directly contributed to the double-digit revenue growth in this area year-to-date. With content from 600 data sources, our offering gives customers access to a broad universe of low-latency financial information with full depth of market data. As firms seek more high-quality data from a range of different sources in a cost-efficient manner, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit.\nWhile our consolidated feeds and index businesses are smaller components of our comprehensive data platform today, they're both well positioned to continue to grow and capture market share, while also serving an important role in our broader enterprise sales strategy.\nTurning now to our mortgage business. The secular shift towards the adoption of an electronic workflow continues, with a life of loan offering that spans from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market, our platform is uniquely positioned to play a fundamental role. In the second quarter, we closed on 29 new Encompass clients as customers focus on modernizing their infrastructure and on workflow issuances.\nBuilding on win announced last quarter such as Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, we are pleased to announce that mortgage solutions at [indiscernible] has signed on to Encompass, expanding the MSP win we announced late last year. We have also just signed another top 15 homebuilder in the U.S. to encompass and our DDA platform, making them the ninth homebuilder of the top 15 to join our community.\nIn addition, as mentioned last quarter, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees data into Encompass, providing customers with more choice of service providers on our platform. In that regard, we're encouraged by the early traction in our cross-sell efforts across these offerings, executing on 200 data cross-sells to Encompass clients in the first half. While these offerings are small components of our business today, these wins give us confidence in our ability to execute on the synergy targets that we laid out at the time of the Black Knight transaction.\nAlong the same lines, following the first integration of Encompass to MSP by leveraging our data and document automation platform for loan onboarding, straight from origination through to servicing, we are pleased to announce that we signed JPMorgan Chase onto this service. For our traditional DDA business, we also had 12 new wins to new and existing Encompass clients in the second quarter alone.\nIn summary, we are pleased to see the value of our platform and solutions are providing, by our comprehensive technology platform that is resonating in the marketplace. With a touch point to nearly every participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. As these new customers come on to our network, we have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect gives us confidence that we can grow a business that, today, is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. At ICE, our mission for more than 20 years, has been to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. We do this by building an operating mission-critical digital networks that leverage our technology, data and operating expertise.\nAt the time of our IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, we were purely an energy exchange, offering only a handful of products to a narrow customer base. Since then, our focus has been building a global platform that has the asset class breadth to enable us to pursue growth opportunities quickly and efficiently as they emerge around the world, and deliver all weather results. While we're known for some of our larger scale acquisitions, we have also completed a wide range of smaller bolt-on transactions. We reimagine these businesses by leveraging technology and crafting significant product development to drive organic growth, further bolstering the content on our networks and accelerating our broadening into new asset classes.\nOperating marketplaces with strong network FX is a core expertise at ICE. And today, we do so across an array of asset classes, GSPs and customer, types. Optimizing the operation of financial services databases helps drive market transparency, and this transparency attracts additional participants, which in turn improves market liquidity. It's a virtuous cycle that continuously expands the network, while strengthening the market.\nStarting with our commodities business in 2001, we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange, which brought us both proprietary content in the form of the Brent Crude Index as well as connectivity to a broad network of energy traders and commercial customers. Building on that foundation, we organically developed and grew hundreds of precise hedging instruments to serve the evolving needs of this commercial customer base. Today, the original Brent crude contract trades alongside our Midland WTI, Cushing WTI, Platts Dubai and Middle East Murban grades of crude to additionally support over 800 related commodity products developed by ICE, giving participants the ability to manage the price of energy at the point of consumption or production around the world.\nIn 2007, we broadened our commodity footprint with the acquisition of the New York Board of Trade adding globally relevant benchmarks such as sugar, cocoa, cotton and coffee. The NYBOT also brought us a clearinghouse, which today we call ICE Clear US. We were able to leverage NYBOT's clearing expertise,and its web-based clearing technology to create ICE Clear Europe, the U.K.'s first new clearing house approved in over a century. Starting from a simple idea, we have grown it into one of the largest clearing houses in the world.\nOur experience in building trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure highlighted for us the importance of analytics, indices and trade valuation services. And in 2015, we broadened our addressable market, moving into fixed income with the acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation. IDC's pricing and reference data businesses are key to transparent price formation in the fixed income markets. They laid the foundation for our expansion into the Asian Index business and the development of a comprehensive platform that, today, we've grown to nearly 500 unique institutional grade data products.\nAnother example of ICE leveraging our technology and infrastructure is our June 24 announcement to apply our proven track record, our expertise in central clearing and our connectivity to the fixed income markets to launch a clearing service for U.S. treasury securities and repurchase agreements. The U.S. Treasury and repo markets are critical to the global collateral management infrastructure, and we are significant users of these treasury products across our 6 clearinghouses. A new SEC rule beginning in 2025 sheds light on the fact that no existing clearing offering is compliant with the rule, opening an opportunity for ICE. We look forward to working with our clients and the entire treasury ecosystem to deliver on this innovation.\nFollowing the proven playbook, we look across futures and fixed income markets and by leveraging our expertise in building new technology, we've banded into the U.S. consumer interest rate markets by developing a digital financing infrastructure for home mortgages. In 2016, we acquired a majority position in the mortgage electronic registry system. We applied ICE's technology expertise to rebuild and modernize its platform and database, allowing us to buy the remaining business stake in 2018. We've since bought and built our way into further market exposure that culminated with the completion of our acquisition of Black Knight last year.\nToday, these assets are part of our broader ICE Mortgage Technology business that we believe is uniquely positioned at the center of an asset class that is moving from analog to digital. The breadth and depth of what we have assembled touches nearly every home mortgage in the United States and includes the largest network of partners that every day ensure that our thousands of customers can efficiently engage, originate, close, finance, value and sell consumer home loans.\nOur approach to overlaying organic growth on our strategic acquisitions is [indiscernible] and comprehensive, allowing us to construct a platform that not only generates strong returns and healthy cash flows but is also positioned to continue to leverage our strengths to generate future growth.\nOur first results are another example of strong execution of this proven strategy. We delivered record revenue, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. These record-setting results reflect the strength of our network and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set. And our expertise has grown, yielding new markets to grow into and new ways to deliver innovative solutions to our customers.\nOur evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues, with a goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. Looking to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers, while driving compounding, all-weather growth for our stockholders.\nBefore I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best single quarter and the best first half in our company's history.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to our moderator, Drew, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time."

First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $930 million, at the low end of our guidance range, driven by an acceleration of planned expense synergies and a few onetime benefits within compensation costs.\nMoving to the balance of the year. we expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $945 million to $955 million, with a sequential increase driven in part by a full quarter of merit increases across the organization, planned investments and the modernization of MSP and higher D&A as recent revenue-related data center investments go live.\nIn addition and in part due to synergies being realized sooner than previously expected, we are lowering our full year expense guidance to $3.79 billion to $3.82 billion. This strong first quarter performance helped to drive record adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and a record earnings per share of $1.48. First quarter free cash flow totaled $877 million, enabling us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $600 million in the first quarter. Since we completed our acquisition of Black Knight in September, we've reduced debt by roughly $2 billion. And as a result, adjusted leverage ended the first quarter approximately 3.9x pro forma EBITDA, with first quarter interest expense down $10 million from the fourth quarter.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segments. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $866 million were up 16%, in part driven by a 12% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 32% year-over-year. This strong performance included a 28% increase in our oil complex, 42% growth in global natural gas revenues driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF, and 26% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of April, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 22% growth in our global commodities and 25% growth in our energy markets.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYC Listings business, revenue totaled $357 million in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021 and lower exchange data revenue at the NYSE. It's worth noting that the IPO market has shown signs of improvement so far in 2024, with the NYSE capturing nearly 70% of total proceeds raised and welcoming 6 of the top 7 IPOs year-to-date, despite more than 50% of new listings not meeting our gold standard of qualification criteria.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $568 million. Transaction revenues of $119 million were driven by growth in corporate bond trading, which was in part driven by strong growth within our institutional channel, this is offset by lower treasury and CD volumes as well as lower levels of CDS clearing activity. Record recurring revenues totaled $449 million and grew by 4% year-over-year.\nIn our fixed income and data analytics business, record first quarter revenues of $288 million increased by 4%. Growth was once again driven by improving trends in our PRD business and another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business. Importantly, fixed income data and analytics ASV, or annual subscription value, improved from the 2% range experienced through much of 2023 to 4% exiting the first quarter as we continue to see customer reengagement and investment across the fixed income ecosystem.\nOther Data & Network Services grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by our feeds business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which grew double digits year-over-year. Importantly, demand for our connectivity solutions remains strong with the backlog of signatures related to our ICE Global Network offering expected to come online and into both ASV and revenue in early July following the build-out of additional data center capacity.\nAs a result, we expect second quarter year-over-year growth in overall recurring revenue to be similar to the first quarter, with year-over-year growth improving in the second half, driven by continued strong trends across fixed income data and analytics, and an acceleration in growth in our other data and network services businesses.\nPlease flip to Slide 7, where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $499 million in the first quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $390 billion. As we noted last quarter, recurring revenues were impacted by both industry consolidation and continued pressure on renewals within our origination technology business. It's worth noting that while current macro conditions are putting pressure on minimums at renewal, and thus, our recurring revenues, customers are overwhelmingly remaining on our platform.\nAnd while yet to manifest in our results, lower minimums upon renewal are paired with a higher price per transaction, a dynamic that will provide an incremental tailwind when industry volumes normalize. Said differently, total contract value in a normal market is on average increasing upon renewal. Transaction revenues totaled $109 million in the first quarter. While closed loans increased slightly, this was offset by lower professional services fees and lower default management revenues within our servicing business. Importantly, as I previously indicated, we have realized expense synergies faster than originally anticipated, which, when coupled with a relatively stable top line on a year-over-year basis, has helped to drive an 8% increase in segment operating income.\nLooking to the full year and after factoring in the dramatic shift in interest rate expectations for 2024 relative to just 3 months ago, we now expect total revenue growth in our Mortgage Technology business to be flat to down in the low single-digit range, with revenues unlikely to improve materially from the first quarter levels until the second half. The high end of the range is underpinned by a flat-to-modest improvement in industry origination volumes or the lower end of the range anticipates a more conservative decline in the mid- to high single-digit range relative to 2023.\nDespite these macro pressures, we continue to invest in product development and enhancement. We continue to expand our existing network and we are executing on our synergy targets, all of which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize.\nIn summary, we delivered another very strong start to the year. We once again delivered strong revenue, operating income, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth. And we continue to invest across our business to meet both the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our customers continue to rely on our leading technology mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate uncertainty while managing risk.\nAcross our global Futures and Options business, total average daily volumes increased 16% to a record 8.1 million lots in the first quarter, including records across commodities, energy and total options. This strong performance drove record futures and options revenues, with energy revenues nearly tripling since the same period in 2010 and growing double digits on average over that time frame. And through April, open interest across our global commodities and energy markets remains at all-time highs, up 22% and 25%, respectively, versus last year, a direct benefit from the long tail of secular growth trends unfolding across global oil, natural gas and environmental markets.\nA number of years ago, we recognized the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any single product or limited to any one region. Instead, we have built a diversified energy network, delivering comprehensive risk management solutions, providing capital efficiencies and positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets.\nIn our oil markets, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers seek not only liquidity in the global -- major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging precision. Reflecting this dynamic, our other crude and refined products continue to set records, with ADV growing double digits on average over the past 5 years. This portfolio increased 47% year-over-year in the first quarter alone, while open interest is up 27% through the end of April.\nIn the more than 20 years that ICE has been building its global energy platform, we have created hundreds of precise hedging instruments, driven by collaboration with our customers. All of these instruments are underpinned by the deep liquidity in our benchmarks such as Brent. In March 2021, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and 9 of the world's largest energy traders as founding partners, we launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD. This new exchange enabled for the first time market participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of a new innovation, the Murban Futures contract, an important benchmark for oil flowing to Asia.\nIn the first quarter, as IFAD marked its third anniversary, our Murban Futures reached new highs, surpassing over 1 million contracts traded along with a series of open interest records in April. Similarly, our Platts Dubai contract had another quarter of record volumes, increasing 58% year-over-year. Another innovation that we launched 2 years ago, the Midland BTI contract known as HOU, is a deliverable crude grade of Midland oil based in Houston. This contract is fast becoming the most accurate representation of the Houston oil market as evidenced by HOU reaching record volumes during the quarter. Further supporting the growth of this new risk management innovation is that this oil has been added into the ICE Brent basket, which creates new opportunities for clients to manage risk by hedging with this contract. Collectively, this strong performance drove another quarter of record oil revenues, up 28% year-over-year.\nIn our natural gas markets, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends we began investing in over a decade ago, beginning with our Endex investment, an investment that has established us as a leader in European gas trading. Today, with Asia as the largest buyer of global LNG, the relationship between our European TTF and Asian JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. In the first quarter, the number of market participants in each market grew double digits versus last year, with both reaching record volumes.\nThis strong performance drove record natural gas revenues, up 42% year-over-year in the first quarter. Importantly, open interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through April, up 90% and 50% year-over-year, respectively. The globalization of natural gas alongside a global focus on decarbonization is critical to environmental markets. Built off of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange more than a decade ago, we operate the world's largest and most liquid environmental markets. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the first quarter.\nAt the same time, ADV across our environmental portfolio increased 22% year-over-year, with open interest up 27% through the end of April. Price transparency across the energy spectrum is critical as [indiscernible] look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. By combining the network and liquidity of our global energy platform with our leading environmental portfolio, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this transition across global energy markets.\nIn summary, the evolution of our energy markets is one example of how we continuously invest and develop customer-driven solutions across asset classes, as well as the creative approach we've taken to leverage our infrastructure, technology and expertise to drive value creation. Our record performance is a product of these investments, some that we've made more than a decade ago, and our commitment to staying close to our customers, an approach that permeates this organization helping to drive effective and efficient product innovation.\nThis approach is also important to our data business, where we are uniquely positioned to leverage our distribution and our infrastructure to create new content and to expand the breadth of our offering. Our position as a leading provider of price and reference data have served as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offering, and the flexibility of our approach to index construction, has contributed to the double-digit average annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017.\nA key driver of this growth is the increase in the passive ETF assets under management benchmarked to our indices, growing to a record of $593 billion through the end of the first quarter from less than $100 billion in 2017. While critical, our pricing data and index businesses are only components of what we offer to this growing industry. As a leading provider of such proprietary data services, we have developed deep expertise in gathering and cleansing unstructured data, skills in building the database that serves as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities not only in the fixed income markets, but across many other asset classes.\nThis is an expertise we're starting to leverage across a number of mortgage data initiatives. For example, in April, we announced the integration of our property and loan-level mortgage data sets with our property level climate risk metrics covering more than 100 million U.S. homes. This integration improves transparency and facilitates risk management throughout the housing finance and property insurance sector, allowing customers to apply ICE's climate metrics to individual loans, properties and entire portfolios, improving the visibility to the inherent climate risks in each.\nIn addition, we are leveraging these insights to enhance asset level climate risk modeling for existing municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities products. As we move forward, there is significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income & Data Services business.\nTurning now to our mortgage business. Following the proven playbook, we've applied across our global energy and fixed income businesses. In mortgages, we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide.\nIn this regard, we're pleased to share that we closed 20 new Encompass clients in the first quarter. Building on the wins we announced last year with banks such as M&T and JPMorgan Chase and the announcement earlier this year of adding Fifth Third Bank to Encompass on top of their move to MSP announced late last year, we are pleased to now announce that Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, both existing MSP clients, are moving to Encompass. Just like many of the other recent wins that we are implementing, these clients see the significant value that we can provide through our complete front-to-back offering.\nFor MSP, building on the capital mortgage solutions of Texas and CapEd credit union wins mentioned on the last call, we closed Lennar, a long time Encompass clients. Our growing customer relationships serve as a validation of our vision, bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for our customers and their clients through one trusted platform. Our clients seek a solution provider that supports digital workflows throughout the home ownership life cycle, starting with matching a consumer to the right lending product at the right time on the loan origination, closing, servicing in the capital markets. This is directly in line with our long-term vision and the journey we have been on.\nImportantly, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the mortgage workflow, and remain committed to investing behind secular growth while enhancing the value proposition of our network. For example, we have completed the evolution of Encompass to a new web user experience, with new automation tools and more ways to partner and extend the platform to serve our customers' business needs. In parallel, we're executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading MSP servicing platform.\nA perfect example of this execution is the recently announced rollout of our MSP Digital Experience, or MSP DX. This service is an intuitive and conversational new interface, leveraging natural language processing for our servicing system designed to streamline workflows, increase efficiencies and expedite training of new servicing personnel. Along the same lines, we've completed our first integration of Encompass to MSP.\nThis integration leverages our data and document automation platform, and our neural network large language model for the classification and extraction of data from documents to automate loan onboarding from Encompass straight to MSP, reducing errors and providing significant efficiencies to clients that have our front-to-back solution set. Simultaneously, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees into Encompass, providing lenders more choice in service providers for these important underwriting data assets.\nIn summary, as we move through 2024 and beyond, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. We are increasingly being asked how ICE is incorporating artificial intelligence into our business. So while I'm not here to discuss the financial impact, I thought I'd touch on some of the AI investments across ICE.\nLike many large corporations, we have developers working on how to integrate AI models into our products, on how we better contract for and monetize our proprietary data sets and on how we improve our own productivity. Along those lines, we created an internal R&D group that we're calling our AI Center of Excellence, where we're testing novel use cases and working to build appropriate governance card guardrails to reduce or eliminate the risks inherent to AI. We are focused on getting it right, while working towards a goal of bringing AI-enabled enhancements and new products to our customers.\nBen just spoke about investing in our mortgage data and document automation product, which is an extension of the product formerly called AIQ that we acquired with Ellie Mae. We've also mentioned investing in our commodity chat platform called, ICE Chat, to improve upon actionable insights and market data. And we've commented on our work using artificial intelligence models for pattern recognition in our regulatory compliance activities. Today, I'd like to further speak to some of the lesser-known, second order impacts of the market's current energetic focus on AI that we see feeding growth to ICE.\nIf you think back to the start of ICE, the prevalent financial exchanges were largely open outcry venues, and both listed and over-the-counter trading involve significant involvement of human intermediaries. Our thesis of using digital networks to connect people and broaden access to risk management pushed us to create and manage our own data centers and network channels. Today, we operate from 14 global data centers, and we've built out the ICE Cloud, a managed network, connecting our data centers to many third-party trading and data venues, and interconnecting major players across the global financial services industry.\nWe've made the determination that managing our own IT infrastructure and making it available to our customers directly and through an ICE-managed cloud offers us a competitive advantage while providing for better intellectual property protection and creating an avenue for our connectivity and data revenue growth. One service that we offer our customers is the ability to utilize their code and equipment within the ICE global network and transmit the digital output across the ICE managed cloud. This ICE strategy has resulted in requests from customers to incorporate their AI models inside our network, and it's driving increasing demand for ICE Data Center and ICE cloud access.\nWe've already received customer deposits for much of our planned year 2025 and year 2026 network build-outs, and we've been working with our vendors to plan for its continued expansion. This customer interest in artificial intelligence modeling should provide a multiyear tailwind to revenue growth in our data and connectivity business. Another second order revenue impact from the current interest in AI is the attention that our listed emissions offset markets and our listed renewable energy markets are receiving from power companies and third-party data center developers as they plan for their future growth, given that ICE is a major host of the world's tradable emission and renewable energy markets.\nOur subsidiary, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers regulated benchmarks, manages our carbon market data service that provides validated data to companies seeking information about the voluntary markets for carbon credits. Interest in these markets is surging as evidenced by corporate involvement more than doubling over the past 6 months to more than 250 firms. And last month, the United Nations Science-based Target Initiative, the world's main verifier of emissions targets, said that it will permit the use of emission offset credits to count towards reducing emissions against Scope 3 targets.\nCoupled with the European Commission's aim to increase its emissions reductions beginning in 2024, plus the EU's inclusion of new industrial sectors that will be subject to these targets, we believe the backdrop for revenue growth in ICE's environmental and renewable markets attributable to AI model demand remains bright.\nShifting now to our strong results. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, yet again delivering the best quarter in our company's history. Our consistent results are a testament to the value of our mission-critical data, leading market technology and the strength of our strategic business model. ICE is a company that has deliberately grown through curated acquisition and entrepreneurship. We have targeted an interrelated collection of markets to help our customers manage risk due to both acts of nature and acts of man.\nTypically, we think of our global commodity-oriented businesses is being levered to act of nature, such as issues that affect supply chain flows. And we think of our global financially oriented risk management businesses as being levered to acts of man, such as Central Bank and cross-border trade policies. We purposely have targeted providing a mix of these businesses to find growth somewhere in the world in varying underlying conditions. And we have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions to facilitate all weather results, such as those we are reporting for this record quarter.\nI'd like to end my prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best-ever quarterly results. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Emily, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time."

I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong fourth quarter and some key highlights from our record 2023 results.\nFourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.2 billion and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased 7% versus last year. For the full year, revenues totaled a record $8 billion, and on a pro forma basis, increased by 4% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $952 million, $3 million below the low end of our original guidance range, driven by lower compensation expense and acceleration of expense synergies. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33, up 6% year-over-year and record full year adjusted EPS of $5.62, also up 6% versus 2022.\n2023 free cash flow totaled a record $3.2 billion, enabling us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends while also continuing to make strategic investments such as our September acquisition of Black Knight. These strong cash flows as well as the full divestment of Black Knight stake in Dun & Bradstreet enabled us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and by $1.4 billion since we closed on our acquisition in early September. As a result, adjusted leverage ended the year at approximately 4.1x pro forma EBITDA.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $781 million were up 22%, in part driven by a 31% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 46% year-over-year. This strong performance included a 41% increase in our oil complex, 66% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by another record setter for TTF and 23% growth in our environmental business.\nIn addition, January sets the tone for what we expect will be another strong year, evidenced by robust levels of total open interest in January, up 20% year-over-year, including 22% growth in global energy and 23% growth in ags as well as record average daily volumes across commodities, energy and total options.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $355 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs across the globe, the NYSE led the industry in transfers for a second straight year, including a total of 32 transfers from other exchanges.\nLooking to 2024, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to grow in the low single digits, driven by continued strong growth in futures exchange data, somewhat offset by growth in our listings business with pressure on initial listing fees abating in the second quarter.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 4% versus a year ago, including transaction revenue of $116 million. For the full year, transaction revenues increased 19% in part driven by 23% growth at ICE bonds, which, since our acquisition of BondPoint and TMC has grown at a CAGR of 11%, driven by growing institutional adoption and higher interest rates.\nRecurring revenues totaled a record $447 million and grew by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, record fourth quarter revenues of $286 million increased by 4%, an acceleration from 2% growth in the third quarter, driven by pricing in reference data and a return to double-digit growth in our index business.\nOther data and network services grew 7% in the fourth quarter driven by continued growth across our desktop, feeds and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktop business, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers as well as continued robust growth in our ICE chat offering. In our consolidated feeds business, we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platform with a record 2023 contributing to a high single-digit revenue CAGR over the last 3 years.\nLooking to 2024, we expect that recurring revenues in our Fixed Income and Data Services business will grow in the mid-single-digit range as we expect the aforementioned trends across fixed income, data and analytics as well as desktops and feeds to continue.\nPlease flip to Slide 7, where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenue totaled $502 million in the fourth quarter, slightly above the high end of our guidance range, with recurring revenues of $397 million accounting for roughly 80% of total segment revenues. In addition, on a pro forma basis, operating income increased 7% year-over-year.\nWe had a strong finish to 2023, registering one of the best quarters for new product sales, including 37 new Encompass clients and 4 new MSP clients. This strong finish capped off what was the best year since 2018 for Encompass and MSP sales. And while these sales will take time to implement and thus recognize the related revenue, there is clear momentum across the industry as customers seek technology and data solutions that drive greater transparency and workflow efficiencies.\nShifting to 2024 guidance. Consistent with the near-term outlook provided in our Black Knight closing call in September, we expect total Mortgage Technology revenue growth on a pro forma basis to be in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range for the full year. The low end of our range assumes only a modest improvement in application and origination volumes, while the high end underwrites a more substantial improvement in the double-digit growth range. It is worth noting that seasonality tends to benefit both the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth.\nRecurring revenues for the year is expected to be roughly flat, including a decline of roughly $5 million to $10 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenues to improve sequentially thereafter as sales implement with the year-over-year growth reemerging in the second half. The sequential pressure on attrition we expect in the first quarter is largely driven by two customers that were acquired, one of which was completed back in 2021.\nMoving to Black Knight synergies. Through the first months -- 5 months post close, we have signed annualized revenue synergies of roughly $30 million or nearly 1/4 of our $125 million 5-year target. It is worth noting that these signings are not expected to have a material impact on our 2024 recurring revenues and will largely begin to be recognized in [ 2025 ] and thereafter. Synergies have largely been driven by cross-sell success across our flagship Encompass and MSP platform as well as in data and analytics.\nTurning to expense synergies. We expect to realize approximately $135 million in annualized savings by the end of 2024, ahead of our original expectations of roughly $100 million by year-end.\nI'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses to be between $3.81 billion and $3.86 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to continue to invest in our people, our technology, including the enhancement of MSP and various growth initiatives across our business. These investments are somewhat offset by expense synergies, which I noted are expected to reach approximately $135 million in run rate annualized savings by the year-end 2024.\nMoving below the line, we expect nonoperating expense to be between $215 million and $220 million in the first quarter. And depending on the future path of short-term interest rates, these expenses should decline slightly in subsequent quarters as we continue to pay down outstanding commercial paper and term loan related to our Black Knight acquisition.\nWe anticipate the full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, up slightly from 2023 through the impact of a full year of higher U.K. taxes. And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million, including approximately $100 million relating to Black Knight, with the vast majority expected to be delivered directed to various technology investments that Ben will detail shortly, and $100 million related to the new office space and expansion and improvement across New York, London and Jacksonville.\nIn summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend, returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders while, at the same time, continue to invest across the business to meet the needs of our customers and expand our Mortgage Technology network through the acquisition of Black Knight. As we kick off 2024, we're focused on, once again, delivering growth and creating shareholder value.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong 2023 results were in part driven by a dynamic macroeconomic environment. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in a variety of macroeconomic environments.\nAcross our energy markets, the depth and breadth of our global platform not only drove records across volumes and revenues in 2023, but opens us well to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition.\nIn our oil markets, we've invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will help enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition. Most recently, ICE's Brent benchmark underwent its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket. This latest evolution contributed to record Brent volumes in 2023, surpassing the record last set in 2021 and demonstrating that the market depends on its ability to reflect global fundamentals.\nAt the same time, our WTI contract reached record volumes and continues to gain share. In addition, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide greater hedging precision. This trend is illustrated by the record trading activity in our other crude and refined products in 2023 with volumes up 35% year-over-year. This strong performance has carried into 2024 with January ADV surpassing the record last set in March of 2020, and at the same time, open interest is up 36%.\nIn our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook, building a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. As energy supply chains evolve and globalize, the quality of our expansive range of benchmarks is evident with our global gas business delivering record revenues in 2023, increasing 44% year-over-year. This strong performance was led by record volumes and participation in our TTF benchmark contract, which we have positioned as the Brent of natural gas and plays a critical role in providing global natural gas price signals.\nA similar dynamic is playing out in our Asian JKM complex with volumes up 17% in 2023 and continued participation growth, including our highest fourth quarter ever. In addition, we continue to see robust open interest trends through January, including record total gas open interest of nearly 38 million lots on January 25, surpassing the record set in 2012. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas.\nWe were also early to diversify into environmentals recognizing the importance of carbon price transparency over a decade ago. As we look out over the longer term, governments, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities, such as placing a price on pollution, carbon-free electricity as well as carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up double digits in the fourth quarter.\nAt the same time, 2023 marked another record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 7% year-over-year. Importantly, because ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, this is a growth trend that we are uniquely positioned to capture.\nIn summary, the globalization of natural gas and the energy transition are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 17% on average over the past 5 years. The strong performance has contributed to an average annual revenue growth rate of 9% in our energy platform over that period, including 28% growth in 2023.\nWith our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we've expanded the range of content that we offer to our customers. We have built and continue to enhance our global energy network that delivers comprehensive risk management solutions, provides capital efficiencies and is positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets while providing the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to navigate the energy transition.\nThis large suite of energy management tools, combined with our ags portfolio, which saw record volumes in 2023 and has hit consistent open interest records through January, makes up our global commodity network of more than 1,000 products and services to help our customers manage risks around evolving supply chain issues, acts of nature and acts of men.\nMoving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Market volatility, higher interest rates and secular trends such as the need for increased automation, demand for flexible delivery solutions and growth in passive investing contributed to another year of record segment revenues in 2023, up 6% versus a year ago. This strength was once again driven by both transaction and recurring revenue growth, highlighting the strength of our all-weather business model.\nHigher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform drove another year of record revenues in our ICE Bonds business, up 23% in 2023 and that performance was on top of a nearly 100% increase in 2022. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments we've made in our other data and network services business where revenues grew 7% in 2023.\nWithin desktops, investments we've made to reduce friction across the workflow directly contributed to double-digit revenue growth in 2023. In our consolidated feeds business, past investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering led to a number of wins driven by displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents, a key driver of the high single-digit revenue growth in this area in 2023.\nFinally, as we move forward, our enthusiasm is focused on continuing to expand and evolve the products and services, which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks that make up our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as part of their overall investing and risk management processes.\nTurning now to our mortgage business. Similar to the playbook we operate across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages, we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that drive workflow efficiencies. Our mortgage network spans from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market providing a true life of loan offering that positions us to lead the transformation of an industry that is moving analog to digital.\nIn this regard, we're pleased to share that we closed 37 new Encompass clients in the fourth quarter and 4 new MSP clients, contributing to a record for new sales on Encompass and the highest in the last 5 years for MSP and Encompass combined.\nBuilding on the Encompass wins mentioned on the last call, such as M&T Bank, we added Raymond James Bank, for their retail and correspondent channels. We also brought back Carrington, a significant nonbank lender and servicer onto the Encompass platform from a third party.\nFor MSP, building on the four wins we had in the fourth quarter, such as Fifth Third that was mentioned on the last call, we closed Capital Mortgage Solutions of Texas and an existing Encompass client, CapEd Credit Union, to start 2024.\nAs we enter 2024, we remain focused on the successful integration of Black Knight and executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the mortgage workflow.\nImportantly, our approach remains consistent with the blueprint we've applied across our other networks, one of investing behind secular growth while enhancing the value proposition of our network. A near-term opportunity to drive greater transparency and efficiency includes integrating Black Knight datasets, such as our closing fee data, tax, flood and valuation models into our Encompass and MSP systems.\nAnother near-term example is integrating our data and document automation platform into MSP, building a digital bridge from origination straight through to servicing, reducing cost, time and errors to onboard loans to the MSP system.\nA third example builds upon our lead providing compliance solutions fully integrated into every aspect of the mortgage origination process and moving towards servicing as well. At the same time, a near-term opportunity is our continued investment in our product -- engine, further strengthening the mortgage ecosystem by providing additional options and greater efficiencies to lenders, servicers and partners.\nIn parallel to these near-term opportunities just mentioned, we are executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading SaaS-based MSP servicing platform following a similar successful process that we have executed against with other companies that we have acquired. Simultaneously, we see an opportunity to advance our digital document vault service that is offered for documents such as e-notes and to extend this as the golden record for other origination and servicing documents to help reduce duplication, improve quality and reduce costs for our customers.\nIn summary, we are pleased to see that the value of our solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform is resonating in the marketplace. The demand we are seeing across our platform gives us confidence that we can grow the business and the $2.1 billion in revenue today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. 2023 was a unique year for the energy markets. The year kicked off with a European ban on the import of Russian crude oil and a $60 Russian oil price cap imposed by the U.S., Japan, Canada and Australia, all driven by the Ukrainian conflict and a forced realignment of the global energy supply chain.\nIn October, a painful conflict with Israel erupted that is testing relationships within the energy-producing Middle East and which caused the U.S. House of Representatives to send a bill to the U.S. Senate imposing further sanctions on Iranian oil.\nIn November, terrorists began attacking ships navigating the Red Sea, causing the world's largest operators of crude oil tankers to modify their supply chain operations out of that region.\nAnd throughout 2023, OPEC+ met to set quotas to cut oil production, attempting to drive oil prices higher for the benefit of Russia and Middle East producers.\nWith this complex geopolitical backdrop, it would be reasonable to assume that we ended 2023 with oil prices pushing towards record highs. Well, that's not the case. Brent crude oil actually end the year with prices lower than where the year started, marking the first annual price decline since the COVID collapse. Even the recent supply shocks and oil shipped from the Red Sea delay oil prices for more than a day or 2.\nWhen we acquired the former International -- Exchange of London in the early 2000s, its flagship product was a -- futures contract on a then not well-known grade of oil called Brent. The Brent oil field consisted of four deepwater oil platforms built in the 1970s in the middle of the North Sea between Scotland and Norway. The waters there are deep and the working environment is hostile. So pipelines were built to move the oil to the remote Shetland Islands, where Brent was loaded directly onto seaborne oil tankers.\nOne of the early challenges that ICE faced trying to grow the trading volumes of this Brent futures contract on our newly acquired exchange was the substantial underlying issue that the Brent oil fields were drying up and oil production was deteriorating. We began working with the oil industry and drove a consensus to allow other grades of oil from locations away from the Brent oilfield to make their way into a newly reconstituted ICE index, which we continue to call Brent.\nOver time, we've evolved the index, and we've added oil from fields called Fortis, Oseberg, Ekofisk, Pearl. And most recently, we added U.S. oil drilled in the Midland basis of West Texas. The pipeline, rail and trucking infrastructure serving the Midland Basin drives a large portion of this U.S. oil towards the Gulf of Mexico, where it becomes available for seaborne export. And the U.S. oil drillers in this region have been very sensitive to global supply and demand price signals.\nTheir market-based responses have caused their U.S. oil exports to set the marginal price of the ICE Brent Index roughly half the time since its latest reconstitution with other global oil grades setting the marginal price for the balance.\nThe Brent oil field began decommissioning in 2006 and its first drilling platform ceased production in 2011 followed by the second and third platform stopping in 2014 and 2021. The fourth and final Brent platform has been repurposed to tap into another oilfield. So today, it's safe to say that there is no longer any Brent in ICE's Brent index.\nDuring our index evolution, ICE marketed the value of the Brent index to the energy industry as the preferred way to hedge global energy prices. U.S. oil exporters are now leveling out the prices for global crude oil, and that's reflected in the Brent index, making the difficult geopolitical shocks that I just highlighted less impactful on global oil prices. The record volume that ICE sees in our Brent oil futures trading complex is a direct result of this focused evolution of our ICE Brent index.\nI tell this story as an example of how we think about the industries in which we operate. We invest in and constantly work with market participants to transform industries to reflect changing environments. We're following a similar road map with our entire energy complex given the analogous macro backdrop of industrialized economies that are attempting to move away from carbon-emitting fuels causing us to list over 1,000 commodity contracts versus just four contracts when we acquired the IPE.\nYou may have seen our recent announcement that ICE is working with the U.S. Department of Energy to develop regional markets for hydrogen fuels as we continue to focus on medium- to long-term cyclical trends and the next energy frontier. Similarly, by creating our ICE Data Services division nearly 9 years ago, we spotted the trend that the single most important asset associated with automation was trusted mission-critical data and digitized information. We've invested in information acquisition, data dissemination and index construction, and you are witnessing our data services division, extending the same playbook that we ran on Brent to transform global benchmarks for financial products in areas such as credit and interest rates.\nAnd these are increasingly making their way on to platforms around the globe, including our own in the form of valuations, reference data, cash markets, derivative markets, ETFs, options and equities. Importantly, we're leaning into this blueprint to drive ICE's most recent expansion with a goal to expand participation, facilitate information transparency and spawn index creation in the U.S. consumer interest rate markets as we move the industry toward a SaaS model on a widely distributed network, a blueprint that captures proprietary data and information that we can organize and disseminate to help our customers make better financial decisions in a world where automation and generative models are key to enabling future efficient workflows.\nIn that vein, and shifting to our strong results, 2023 marked our 18th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, a record every year that we've been a public company. This record of growth reflects the quality of our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest industries undergoing analog to digital conversions, a strategy that's made ICE an all-weather name, which through an array of macroeconomic environments continues to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders.\nAs we look to 2024 and beyond, we're better positioned than ever to capitalize on secular and cyclical trends that occur across asset classes, and we remain focused on investing and executing on many growth opportunities in front of us.\nI'd like to conclude these prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2023. And I want to thank my colleagues for their contribution to the best year in our company's history. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our operator, Charlie, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

My name is Lauren, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nInvestor Relations Analyst\n\nGood morning. ICE's third quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nThroughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call are -- today, are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per share was a record, totaling $1.46, up 11% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $2 billion and on a pro forma basis, increased 4% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in our Exchange segment which was led by 22% growth in our futures platform. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $812 million, including $56 million related to Black Knight and $756 million related to legacy ICE, which was $4 million below the -- of our original guidance range, largely driven by lower technology spend, including reduced cloud exposure as we continue to optimize and drive efficiency through our data center footprint.\nAs we move into the fourth quarter, we expected adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter, driven by additional rent, D&A and seasonality and capitalized labor as well as a full quarter of expense related to Black Knight.\nMoving below the line. Adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $114 million, including $41 million of incremental interest expense related to our acquisition of Black Knight. We expect adjusted nonoperating expense in the fourth quarter to between $225 million and $230 million, largely driven by the full core impact of acquisition-related interest expense. It is also worth noting that we have reduced our term loan and CP outstanding by around $700 million since transaction closed in early September.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $754 million were up 13%, driven by 42% growth in our energy revenues. This strong performance included 48% growth in global natural gas driven by a record quarter of TTF volumes. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global [ oil ] business with ADV up 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and open interest at the end of October, up 26% year-over-year.\nAs we look to the fourth quarter, it's worth noting that we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million, with the third quarter benefiting from a few items that we don't anticipate will repeat. In addition, and in light of the strong performance in our equity options business, where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we've elected to a regulatory fee holiday, which will temporarily reduce OTC and other revenues by $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter.\nShifting away from transaction revenues. Recurring revenues increased by 4% year-over-year, including 8% growth in Exchange data services. which is once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data as well as a benefit of a few million dollars related to audit recoveries, which we don't expect will repeat in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by our listings business where growth in annual listings fees was offset by the rolling off of initial listings fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021.\nTurning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $559 million, up 4% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 6%, including 9% growth in ICE bonds and 5% growth in our CDS clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our desktop, feeds and derivative analytics offerings.\nWithin our desktop business, revenues once again grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers as well as the continued robust growth in our ICE chat offering in part driven by growing adoption of large language models.\nIn our consolidated feeds business, we once again grew high single digits and expect to exceed $100 million of revenue for the full year as we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platform.\nIn our fixed income, data and analytics business, we generated a record $279 million in the third quarter with sequential growth in revenue driven by our North American pricing and reference data business or PRD. While PRD growth may continue to be below trend in the near term, we're seeing signs of an improved sales cycle alongside strong retention.\nLet's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Third quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $330 million, including $87 million related to Black Knight. Recurring revenues totaled $235 million and on a pro forma basis, $396 million, representing nearly 80% of total pro forma segment revenues. Despite the headwinds facing the mortgage industry and the related near-term pressure on our recurring revenues, sales continued to be robust as customers look to reshape and modernize how they do business.\nThrough October, we have already surpassed our prior full year record for new Encompass sales, which was set in 2020. In our servicing solutions business, the closing of the Black Knight transaction has unlocked the pipeline with four new MSP customers signed October alone, including a top 25 servicer, [ Fifth Bank ]. This compares to a total of five signings through the first 9 months of the year and has quickly put 2023 on track to be the second best year for MSP sales since 2017. In addition, as we look to 2024 and continuing the momentum, we have seen post close, the current pipeline for MSP is at its highest level in 5 years.\nWhile we expect the secular trend of customers seeking greater efficiency across their workflows to continue, it's important to note that these strong sales results will take time to implement. And looking to the fourth quarter, we anticipate near-term cyclical headwinds will persist, coupled with typical seasonal pressures on origination volumes in the first and fourth quarters of each year, we expect the total fourth quarter IMT revenues will be in the range of $490 million to $500 million, bringing full year pro forma -- revenues to approximately $2.06 billion and in the middle of the guidance range we provided on our Black Knight closing call in late September.\nIn summary, at a consolidated ICE level, we once again grew revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. And as we look to the end of the year and into 2024, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and to create value for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. For now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I would like to first welcome the Black Knight team to their first ICE earnings call. While it has been less than 2 months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, we've been very impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time, a testament to the talent of our respective employee populations and our shared entrepreneurial cultures.\nSimilar to our exchanges and fixed income [ businesses ], Black Knight integrated into our ICE Mortgage Technology network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with efficiency gains that we bring to our customers.\nAs we have seen across our network in futures and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create mission-critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinning are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels an analog to digital conversion of an industry, and it is a blueprint we've applied across all our businesses.\nA number of years ago, we saw the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major gold benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging pursuit.\nOur global oil complex spans over 700 products, including locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These products are built off of our benchmark contracts, such as Brent crude oil and gas oil.\nDriven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex up 26% year-over-year through the end of October, including a 28% increase in our other crude and refined products.\nIn our natural gas markets, we began investing in the globalization of these markets over a decade ago. Today, our European TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes continue to grow and reach important milestones as they evolve into global gas benchmarks.\nIn the third quarter, the number of participants in each market grew double digits year-over-year and TTF reached another quarter of record volumes. This strong performance helped drive record revenues across our natural gas complex through the first 9 months of 2023, up 37% year-over-year. In addition -- interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through October, up 58% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas.\nWe are well positioned to both benefit from the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia.\nIn our environmental markets, we recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago by acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business.\nAs we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year.\nImportantly, because we offer one of the broadest suites of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows.\nIn summary, these cleaner energy sources combined, including global natural gas and environmental make up over 40% of our energy revenues today and have grown 17% on average over the past 5 years, including a 30% growth year-to-date.\nAs the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmentals, alongside our gas and oil complexes, will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks.\nMoving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. As fixed income markets electronify and passive investing grows, our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 7% year-to-date. Investments we've made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business continue to pay dividends. Year-to-date, this part of our business is up 7%, driven by strength across our desktop, derivatives analytics and feed offerings as customers continue to modernize workflows.\nWithin our desktops business, the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow have contributed to double-digit revenue growth year-to-date, along with double-digit growth in the number of users that connect to our ICE Chat platform.\nSimilarly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have led to accelerating adoption by large financial institutions. This has directly contributed to high single-digit growth in this area year-to-date.\nIn addition, we continue to see strength in our index business driven by double-digit growth in ETF assets under management as of the end of the third quarter, with now over $0.5 trillion in assets selecting ICE indices as the passive benchmark.\nAs we move forward, we will continue to build on our track record of adding efficiencies and bringing transparency to opaque asset classes, leveraging our mission-critical data assets and market-leading technology.\nTurning now to our mortgage business. Like what we saw in the commodity markets 20 years ago, there's an analog to digital conversion occurring in the U.S. residential mortgage industry. Critical to our ability to execute on this opportunity is our network, one that in combination with Black Knight, spans from consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market.\nIn the third quarter, our mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry that experienced a nearly 20% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry.\nPart of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the third quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, roughly 60% increase their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per closed loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction revenues when the market returns.\nIn addition, part of our thesis has been at clients that have origination businesses, combined with servicing businesses, we want to bring together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. As mentioned last quarter, JPMorgan Chase has selected Encompass for their loan origination system across all channels and has implemented or is implementing our data and document automation platform. These wins are on top of a long-standing, great relationship with MSP for servicing, which now positions us to provide a platform to help facilitate their front-to-back experience for their clients.\nAnd since we closed on Black Knight, I am pleased to share two new wins along the same lines. First, M&T Bank has now selected Encompass to replace their existing loan origination platform and has added our data and document automation platform on top of the existing MSP relationship for servicing, again, positioning us to provide our platform to support the front-to-back experience for their clients.\nThe second new win is with [ Fifth Third Bank ]. We have cross-sold MSP and several data and analytics products to Fifth Third Bank, an existing IMT customer, our consumer engagement solutions and all regs [ product ].\nIn summary, these are major wins for us and serve as a validation of our vision with large clients bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. The relationships with these great customers are models we plan to replicate with many more.\nIncreased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow the business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please now turn to Slide 9. The idea to start ICE came in the late 1990s, an idea to take advantage of the move of commerce to the Internet and an idea to capitalize on changing government regulations regarding energy procurement.\nThe subsequent dot-com crash and the collapse of [ Enron ] created a very difficult business environment, particularly the trading of energy. But it was in this challenging environment where ICE was able to gain a toehold into the market and build the foundation for a growing business in commodity trading, a business that, as you've just heard, continues to flourish more than 20 years later.\nSometime around 2006, we came across a newspaper article about credit default swaps and the difficulty that this market was having settling such contracts. We became convinced that ICE could build a clearinghouse infrastructure that could solve these delivery problems. Our colleagues took up the challenge and we acquired targeted platforms and talent.\nTwo years later, when the financial crisis of 2008 froze the CDS markets, we were in a position to offer a sustainable solution. And when the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the European Market Infrastructure Act of 2012 required the use of clearinghouses in the over-the-counter swaps markets, ICE was able to expand what has now become another significant business for us.\nI tell you these stories not as some kind of victory lap, but to remind you of our repeated experience that the best time to lay the groundwork for a strong future is when your target customers are experiencing stress and are open to new vendors and new platforms to alleviate their problems.\nI also remind you that evolutions in regulation in the financial services industry typically follow periods of economic change and that standardized, open and transparent platforms, such as those that ICE operates, can benefit.\nAnd ultimately, I call your attention to our history to answer a question that we've been asked, why is ICE investing in a consumer finance technology platform via the mortgage market? And why do it now? We spoke on our recent call following the closing of our acquisition of Black Knight about our aim to build financial market infrastructure across the company that can offer earnings and dividend growth in variable market conditions, all weather growth that will allow our shareholders to have confidence that they won't have to time their investments into -- an episodic earnings stream.\nThere are currently many stress points across large portions of the U.S. mortgage industry and ICE is experiencing an openness from market participants and its regulators to consider new solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform. This is why Warren and Ben were able to tell you in specifics about the encouraging reception that we're receiving for our vision to rewire the mortgage market. And why Ben shared our success with platform clients like JPMorgan Chase, M&T Bank and Fifth Third Bank, all of whom are significant sophisticated drivers of the market.\nThe same economic stress that exists in the current U.S. mortgage market is, in converse, fueling growth on our commodity hedging and credit protection platforms, which benefited ICE's record third quarter earnings. We're positioning ourselves to transform the U.S. mortgage market while it is under stress with a goal to create opportunities to spring-load our future growth and contribute to our all-weather earnings and dividend growth road map.\nAnother topic that we're being asked about a lot is our adoption of large language models and learning algorithms. ICE has long been investing in adaptive learning tools beginning more than a decade ago when we incorporated learning tools into our growing ICE chat system as a way of automating workflows based on unstructured trader and back-office conversations. We're also -- we've been deploying learning models in our compliance effort to recognize trading and use patterns that deviate from norms.\nBen mentioned our ICE Mortgage Technology product, now called Data and Document Automation, which is an extension of the learning model that we acquired within Ellie Mae. This product recognizes a wide variety of documents that end up in a consumer file when underwriting a loan, documents such as pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements and alike, which the algorithm automatically identifies and places in appropriate digital folders.\nThe model extracts key structured and unstructured data elements from these folders for further validation by a credit team via a workflow that detects exception cases for the compliance team. Our model is based on a transparent rules engine, which we believe will assist our customers and their regulators to comply with the President's recent private letter ruling on model fairness, integrity. And our model is being further extended by us across our expanding mortgage platform.\nOur experience in building and deploying these learning models also facilitates our research into the cost of computation that is associated with model queries, and it permits us to have a thoughtful understanding of the cost benefit analysis of their deployment and the model's extension.\nWhen we acquired the New York Stock Exchange, it was built on a technology stack that was overly complicated, hard to manage and unreliable. So we set off to completely rebuild the underlying architecture with modern technology.\nGiven the importance of the New York Stock Exchange to the global economy, we had to rebuild the exchange while it was in daily use. And its extensive connectivity to the global financial services industry demanded that we not ask our customers to invest in making changes on their side of the firewall.\nSo we wrap the old technology with a modern front end and methodically rebuilt and replaced all of the back-end hardware and software. This process took us years to execute with our successful final software rollout just a few days ago, deprecating the last of its seven unique legacy matching engines.\nOur upgrade blueprint worked. And today, the New York Stock Exchange sits atop one of the most powerful, deterministic performance and resilient tech stacks in the world.\nThis same plan to build a new bridge while the cars continue to drive across it was deployed by us when we acquired Interactive Data Corporation. There, we inherited over 100 legacy servers, many of which literally could not be shut down for fear of not being able to properly restart them. We, again, replaced this mess with a modern data superstore over a period of 6 years and without sacrifice from our customer base.\nWhen we made our initial investment in MERS, its technology was outsourced, and was not able to keep up with the demands placed on it during the financial crisis. Our business deal with MERS ownership consortium was to rebuild the platform within 2 years. If successful, we had an option to buy and run the company. We did just that. And MERS is now a cornerstone to our broad U.S. mortgage industry platform.\nWith our acquisition of Black Knight, we've again undertaken a blueprint to wrap its legacy technologies, tie it to our mortgage platform for near seamless integration with our customer base and rebuild its tech stack with a modern architecture over the coming years.\nAs I've mentioned on past calls, ICE is agnostic to cloud providers, but we also operate our own proprietary cloud with ICE data centers having connectivity to a vast portion of the global financial services industry. This allows us to oversee our costs and stand behind our performance, a cloud strategy that Warren mentioned was a contributor to our record earnings in the quarter.\nIn summary, my comments today highlight three backdrops that ICE follows to evolve our all-weather business model. We invest in environments that may have fallen out of favor and at times when customers need us the most. We embrace regulatory shifts and the workflow alterations that inevitably follow periods of economic change. And we embraced an experiment with new technologies, while enhancing technology assets that we may acquire to drive platform efficiencies and better serve our customers.\nShifting now to ICE's strong results. Please turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we delivered the best quarter in our company's history with record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. We have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all weather results. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year are another example of strong execution across our platform.\nAnd I'd like to end our prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best ever quarterly results following up on our unsurpassed results of the first half.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn our call back to our moderator, Lauren, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

My name is Bailey, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations. Katia, please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nInvestor Relations Analyst\n\nGood morning. ICE's second quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is still pending regulatory approval, and we expect to close in the second half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filings for additional information regarding the transaction.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials.\nWhen used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 8% year-over-year driven by total net revenues of $1.9 billion. This marked the best second quarter in our company's history and was on top of 14% adjusted EPS growth in the second quarter of 2022.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $756 million, $7 million below the low end of our guidance range and up 2% versus the prior year. Higher SG&A, including an increase in spend related to an uptick in IPO activity late in the second quarter as well as higher [ D&A ] and rent, both of which were driven by a handful of lease write-offs as we consolidate our real estate footprint, was offset by higher capitalized labor and lower professional fees. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 60% and a 5% increase in adjusted operating income to $1.1 billion, which was on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of 2022.\nLooking to the third quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $760 million to $770 million with the year-over-year increase driven by additional compensation and technology expense as well as roughly $10 million of FX. As a result, we're now -- we now expect that full year adjusted operating expenses will be between $3.04 billion and $3.06 billion and towards the [ low ] end of our guidance range.\nMoving below the line, adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $84 million in the quarter, improving sequentially due to higher cash balances that we build consideration for our acquisition of Black Knight as well as higher interest rates on those cash balances.\nShifting to the tax rate. As the increase in the U.K. tax rate became effective in April of this year, we confirmed our ability to make certain U.S. tax elections, which primarily led to a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 22%. As a result, we now expect to be around the low end of our 24% to 26% guidance range for both the second half and full year.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $736 million were up 12% driven by 33% growth in energy revenues. This strong performance included 52% growth in global natural gas revenues driven by a record quarter for both TTF volumes and participation as well as 9% growth in our [ environmental ].\nIn addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business, particularly our crude oil benchmarks, Brent, Murban, Dubai, WTI and Midland WTI with ADV up 26% year-over-year in the second quarter and open interest as of the end of July up 21% year-over-year. Importantly, this is helping to drive strong open interest trends across our global commodity futures and options complex, including 15% growth in global energy and 21% growth in ags.\nRecurring revenues increased by 2% year-over-year, including 6% growth in exchange data services, which was once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data. This was partially offset by our listings business, where capital markets activity through much of the first half was relatively muted. However, the IPO market started to open up towards the end of the quarter with the NYSE acting as the backdrop for 91% of total capital raised in the second quarter.\nIn addition, the NYSE continues to lead the industry with a total of 12 operating companies transferring from other exchanges so far this year, representing a combined market cap of roughly $100 billion.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $546 million, up 6% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 23%, including 17% growth in ICE bonds and 25% growth in our CDS clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASP grew by 4% driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings.\nWithin desktop, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers as well as continued robust growth in our ICE chat offering where the number of users has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last 5 years to nearly 120,000 as the end of [indiscernible]. This growth has been driven by the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow, including the development and refinement of a proprietary large language model within ICE chat. And as a result of these enhancements, through the first half of this year, we have seen a nearly 60% increase in energy volume executed through our ICE chat platform.\nLastly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we have made to elevate and enhance our offering continues to pay dividends, evidenced by double-digit revenue growth and a number of wins, both in the quarter and first half driven by displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents. This collective performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business, which increased by 7% in the second quarter and 9% including -- excluding the impact of Euronext.\nIn our fixed income data and analytics business, similar to the last few quarters, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our end-of-day pricing business. Somewhat offsetting was a return to year-over-year growth in our index business, driven by growth in ETF assets under management to a record $526 billion as of the end of 2Q.\nLet's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Second quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues, which account for nearly 70% of segment revenues, totaled $164 million and helped to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 40% decline in origination volumes.\nWhile data and analytics recurring revenue grew double digits year-over-year and nearly 2/3 of our Encompass customers up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimums, growth was offset by those electing to renew at lower levels as well as reduced spend on ancillary products such as our CRM and marketing solutions, which tend to be utilized by customers that are more refi-focused. Importantly, the vast majority of these customers not only remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform but have also signed multiyear contract renewals.\nWhile macro conditions appear to be stabilizing and year-over-year pressure on forward-looking application volumes appears to be moderating, evidenced by a mid-teen decline in July applications compared to a nearly 30% decline in 2Q and nearly 50% decline in the first quarter, current cyclical pressures are now likely to drive our recurring revenue growth into the low single-digit range for the full year. However, these same cyclical conditions and the need to reexamine legacy cost structures continues to attract customers that have not traditionally utilized the ICE Mortgage Technology platform.\nAs an example, the top 5 bank that elected to replace their in-house solution with Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has now also signed on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. In addition, Cross Country Mortgage, a top 15 lender and Encompass user, signed on to utilize our analyzers in what was one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history, following JPMorgan's adoption of our analyzer suite last year.\nWhile these wins will take time to implement and are therefore not expected to impact our 2023 recurring revenues, it's a clear example of the increasing need for workflow efficiencies. And we expect there to be continued momentum through the balance of this year and into 2024.\nMoving to Slide 8. In summary, it was a record first half. We delivered revenue, operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business and future profitable growth opportunities. And we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers and create value for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. Amidst the dynamic macro environment we've witnessed in the first half of 2023, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to manage their risk.\nAcross our commodities markets, average daily volumes increased 17% in the quarter and were up 7% when compared with the first half of 2022, including a 16% growth in energy and a 27% growth in our agricultural portfolio in the second quarter as customers respond to changing weather patterns given the El Nino conditions and its impact on commodity supplies.\nIn energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution towards cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown double digits on average over the past 5 years.\nThis strong performance has contributed to an average annual growth rate of 8% in our energy platform over that period, growth that is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understanding their evolving risk management needs and expanding the breadth of the content that we offer across our energy network.\nIn our oil markets, ICE's Brent benchmark, the largest crude oil futures and options market in the world, has undergone its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket, creating a new Midland exposure for the oil market to manage. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE Midland WTI reached record volumes during the quarter, along with a series of open interest records in July.\nIn addition, commercial customers continue to demand more additional, more precise hedging tools and that we're in a unique position to provide, given their correlation to our benchmark contracts such as Brent. This trend is best illustrated by the continued growth of our other crude and refined products line, up 17% in the first half and up 33% in the second quarter.\nIn our natural gas markets, driven by a record-setting quarter in our TTF gas benchmark, revenues were up 32% in the first half, including 52% growth in the second quarter. In addition, open interest trends in our global gas complex remained strong through July, up 16% year-over-year, including a 34% increase in our TTF complex and a 15% increase in our North American gas business.\nImportantly, because we have built a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. In our environmental markets, as we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year.\nImportantly, because we offer one of the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Some recent examples of customer-led innovation include the launch of futures on Washington State carbon program, along with soon-to-be launched futures on Alberta's carbon program, which is expected to go live in the third quarter.\nIn summary, as the energy evolution continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental markets alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.\nMoving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 9% in the first half. This growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.\nInterest rate volatility as well as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform contributed to a 51% increase in our ICE bonds business in the first half versus last year. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made in our other data and network services business, which is up 7% in the first half driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings.\nTurning now to our Mortgage business. In the second quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed a broader industry that experienced a nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry.\nPart of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the second quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, over 60% increased base subscriptions.\nImportantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per closed loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction volumes when the market returns. In addition, we continue to have constructive conversations with customers as they seek greater workflow efficiencies.\nFor example, the top 5 bank that elected to implement Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has expanded their relationship with us, signing on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. And during the quarter, we had one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history with the signing of Cross Country Mortgage to implement our analyzer offering.\nImportantly, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.\nOur ability to capture this secular trend is illustrated on Slide 22 of the appendix. While origination volumes on the Encompass platform in the first half were comparable if not slightly below those seen in the first half of 2018, pro forma IMT revenues have increased over 50% with recurring revenues growing at a 14% compounded annual growth rate.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. The I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. While we're unable to answer any questions on this call relating to the pending litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, I'll briefly discuss our announcement to divest of Optimal Blue.\nOn July 17, we announced that we entered into an agreement whereby contingent on the close of our acquisition of Black Knight, Constellation Software will acquire Optimal Blue for total consideration of $700 million. This consideration includes $200 million of upfront cash and $500 million in the form of a seller finance note, which we have committed to place into the market within 6 months following the transaction close.\nWe intend to provide additional performance details upon the closing of Black Knight, but it's worth noting that we continue to target revenue synergies of $125 million and expense synergies of $200 million by year 5. As a result of our agreeing to sell Optimal Blue, our federal trial was rescheduled to August 14. And we are in a dialogue with the FTC about potential resolution.\nThe transaction with Constellation Software will keep Optimal Blue and the Empower loan origination system together under a single, highly credible owner. A related agreement will continue and expand our commercial relationship to facilitate Optimal Blue being made fully available to ICE's customers on our open network.\nAs the largest distributor of Optimal Blue via our network, we remain very excited about the value and efficiencies that the combined ICE and Black Knight entities will bring to the end consumer as well as to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.\nShifting to ICE's strong results, please turn to Slide 11. In the second quarter, we grew revenues. We grew adjusted operating income, and we grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history.\nThese record-setting first half results reflect on the quality of our strategy and more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues, giving investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk.\nWe've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. We believe that the combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.\nLooking to the second half of the year and beyond, we are positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth.\nBefore I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Bailey. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 was driven by net revenues of $1.9 billion, including record exchange revenues and record fixed income and data service revenues, which increased 12% year-over-year. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, $5 million below the low end of our guidance range, driven by timing of professional services fees and technology spend. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 61% and a record adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion.\nLooking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $763 million to $773 million, with a sequential increase driven by the full quarter impact of 2023 merit increases as well as strategic investments in technology and growth initiatives across our business.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion. Transaction revenues of $739 million were driven in part by 15% growth in agricultural commodities and a 16% increase in our global natural gas business. Importantly, open interest trends remain strong across futures and options as of the end of April, including 6% growth in global energy and 17% growth in ags.\nIt's worth noting that on May 1, we implemented select price increases within our energy business, capturing a portion of the substantial value we have brought to the asset class over the last decade through both continuous product innovation and technology enhancements. Depending on the mix of volumes, we would expect a benefit to our energy RPC beginning with the second quarter.\nRecurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYC listings business, increased by 5% year-over-year, including 8% growth in Exchange data services, which was in part driven by double-digit growth and a number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data. This was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business, where industry-wide capital markets activity continued to be relatively muted.\nIt's worth noting that despite the current environment, the IPL backlog continues to grow, and another 8 companies elected to transfer to the NYSE through April, building on a record year for transfers in 2022.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 54%, including 106% growth in ICE bonds and 42% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility and higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, recurring revenues grew by 4%, driven by additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as strong growth across our analytics and desktop offerings, with strong demand from energy- and environmental-focused customers.\nThis performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business, which increased by 8% in the first quarter and 10%, excluding the impact of Euronext. Similar to last quarter, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our end-of-day pricing business as well as pressure in asset-based revenues in our Index business, which declined year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets in 2022, such as equities and corporate bonds, and into munis [indiscernible] ETFs.\nLet's go to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. First quarter mortgage technology revenues totaled $236 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 70% of segment revenues, totaled $165 million and grew 6% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continued to help drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes.\nWhile nearly 2/3 of our Encompass customers that came up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimums, helping to drive year-over-year and sequential growth in recurring revenues, it was somewhat offset by increased pressure from customers electing to renew at lower levels. Importantly, the vast majority of these customers remain on the Encompass and ICE mortgage technology platform.\nWhile we expect to continue to outperform the industry, if current cyclical conditions persist, we would expect recurring revenues to be towards the lower end of our mid- to high single-digit guidance range for the year. These same cyclical conditions and cost pressures are also increasingly attracting customers that have not traditionally been on the Encompass platform. This is best evidenced by our first signing of a top 5 global bank during the quarter, electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology. While not expected to impact 2023 recurring revenues, that's helped to drive the best quarter for new sales of Encompass in the product's history and is a clear testament to the increasing need for workflow efficiencies and another example of the synergy opportunities that exist for ICE across the mortgage industry.\nIn summary, we delivered another quarter of revenue, operating income and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business and future profitable growth opportunities, and we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers and create value for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Amidst a very dynamic macro environment, including a shock to the banking sector, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions. This contributed to our all-time highest single-volume day of 14.5 million contracts across our markets on March 13. Along with this, we also achieved record options volumes across our commodities in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. As seen historically, options contracts are an efficient and valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions.\nIn our interest rate markets, central bank activity and banking concerns led to increased hedging activity driving 18% volume growth in the first quarter. This growth was underpinned by a 25% volume increase in our Euribor contract, including record futures volumes. We also had a record volumes in our SONIA contract, up 12% year-over-year. This strong performance is a testament to the strength of our multicurrency multi-benchmark offering across interest rates.\nAcross our global energy markets, how energy is produced and consumed has evolved rapidly. Importantly, we have continuously invested alongside this evolution, building a global platform that today is one of the most diverse and liquid energy marketplaces in the world. This platform has established benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy. And with record energy options in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year and energy open interest up 6% through the end of April, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid market to manage their risk.\nIn our oil markets, we've invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition. Today, the resilience and liquidity of ICE's Brent benchmark has surpassed other oil benchmarks in both volume and open interest and, at the same time, reached an all-time high in options market share. This demonstrates that the market depends on the Brent benchmark's ability to reflect global fundamentals.\nImportantly, Brent stands as the cornerstone of a franchise spanning key price benchmarks across gas oil; WTI; Platts Dubai; and more recently, Murban. Together, these benchmarks form the foundation of a cohesive web of more than 700 related oil products, such as locational, product and refining spreads.\nIn the last few years, we've also invested in biofuels and renewable oil products such as RINs, RVOs, biofuels and low-carbon fuel standard products. And while small today, we see positive signs that these will become meaningful contributors in the future. Importantly, driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products, with open interest in our oil complex up 5% year-over-year through the end of April.\nIn our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook, building a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, a thoughtful approach that positions us well to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. This has also helped us drive a 10% increase in global gas volumes in the first quarter. This includes a 14% growth in our North American gas business, which not only benefited from continued commercial engagement in our Henry Hub contract, but also our North American basis markets.\nIn our environmental markets, we recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010. As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions, as illustrated by a record number of market participants in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.\nIn summary, as the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, provide the critical price transparency that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.\nMoving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive platform continued to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another quarter of record revenues, up 12% year-over-year. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Rising market uncertainty and interest rates as well as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms provided significant tailwinds for ICE bonds, which was up over 100% year-over-year.\nWe're also beginning to see return on the investments we've made in both enhanced content and functionality across our other data and network services business. This part of our business increased 8% in the first quarter, driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE global network, our private cloud as well as strong growth across our analytics and desktop offerings. As we move forward, there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income and Data Services business. From the digitization of fixed income workflow to the innovations we bring to connectivity and market data, ICE is well positioned for long-term success and growth.\nTurning now to our Mortgage business. In the first quarter, we once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues, up 6% year-over-year. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry.\nPart of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While still in the early days of this transition, we continue to see strong client adoption.\nImportantly, as customers increasingly seek efficiencies across a very manual process, our leading origination technology, known as Encompass, provides valuable digital solutions that can reduce both the time and cost required to originate a loan. We are pleased to see the value of our offering continues to resonate with lenders, and this is highlighted by the fact that we had record new sales in our Encompass offering in the first quarter, and the sale success included, for the first time, a top 5 global bank, electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology for their retail business. This is a testament to the trust and strong relationships ICE has established with our customers since our founding.\nAdditionally, the recent exit of the largest correspondent lender in the country that was not on Encompass presents opportunities for lenders that are on Encompass. This focus on automation and efficiencies also contributed to a 10% growth in our data and analytics business. Through our AIQ offering, customers can leverage our analytics such as our credit and income analyzers as well as leverage our automated document recognition and data extraction technology to reduce the manual stare-and-compare work that exists across the mortgage workflow today. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.\nThe continued growth in our recurring revenues is a testament to the demand we're seeing for these digital solutions. As these new customers come on to our network, we benefit from new subscription revenues and have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect is what we believe will drive compounding growth in our recurring revenues and gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog-to-digital conversion.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. Since the initial announcement in May of 2022, ICE has remained unwavering in its belief and commitment to the combination of our companies. In March, we announced revised terms of our merger agreement to acquire Black Knight at $75 per share or a market value of $11.7 billion from our previous terms of $85 per share. Black Knight's shareholders approved this revised deal last week.\nIn addition, and although I strongly believe that acquiring Black Knight is entirely pro-competitive, we also announced an agreement to sell Black Knight's Empower loan origination system, plus certain related businesses to Constellation Software Inc. We did this in order to remove a perceived horizontal competition concern. The divestiture transaction is subject to the closing of ICE's acquisition of Black Knight and other customary closing conditions. Ice and Black Knight intend to defend the pro-consumer merits of our revised merger in Federal District Court. A scheduling hearing is scheduled to take place on May 12 to establish the timetable for this process. After which time, we'll have a better ability to discuss the calendar for deal completion. We're unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight. We remain fully confident in our position, and we look forward to presenting it in Court. Importantly, we're very excited about the value and the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer as well as other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.\nShifting to our strong results. The first quarter was highlighted by record adjusted operating results. That include continued compounding recurring revenue growth across all 3 business segments, along with record revenues in our Exchange and Fixed Income and Data Services businesses. Remarkably, we did this against last year's exceptional first quarter with its unprecedented volatility, driven largely by the onset of conflict in the Ukraine. These strong first quarter results are a testament to the value of our data and technology and the strength of our strategic business model.\nOver the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers, resulting in value for our stockholders. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues. The compounding growth of our subscription-based services, combined with our diverse transaction-based businesses, means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle, to one geography or to one asset class. This provides upside exposure while hedging our downside risk.\nLooking to the balance of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.\nBefore I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to say, thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to another good quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call now back to our moderator, Lauren, and we'll conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI'll now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Investor Relations and Senior Analyst. Katia, please go ahead.\n\nKatia Gonzalez\n\nIR Analyst, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nGood morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2022 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is pending customary regulatory approval, and we expect to close in the first half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filings for additional information regarding the transaction.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of our earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE.\nI'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Net revenues of $1.8 billion were driven by transaction revenues of $828 million and recurring revenues of $940 million, up 4% year-over-year. For the full year, revenues totaled $7.3 billion, also up 4% versus last year.\nFourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were within our guidance range, including approximately $5 million of additional severance. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 and full year adjusted EPS of $5.30, an increase of 5% versus 2021.\n2022 free cash flow totaled a record $2.9 billion, which enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders while also continuing to make strategic investments across our business. In addition, we have received Board authorization to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2023, extending our 10-year track record of double-digit dividend growth.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $982 million. Transaction revenues of over $600 million were driven in part by 11% growth in agricultural commodities and 13% growth in our equity derivatives business. Importantly, open interest trends remain strong across our Futures & Options in January, including 14% growth in global natural gas and 24% growth in Euribor.\nRecurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business increased by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Customer growth, particularly within our energy exchange data, was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business where industry-wide capital markets activity was relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs across the globe, we had a record year for listing transfers with 34, including more operating companies in the last 3 years combined. For the full year, Exchange segment revenues increased by 8%, including a 33% increase in our interest rate business, a 20% increase in equity derivatives and an 8% increase in our global natural gas revenues.\nTurning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $537 million, up 13% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 89%, including 182% growth in ICE bonds and 66% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenue growth of 3% was driven by demand for additional capacity on ICE Global Network as well as strong growth across our desktop, feeds and analytics offerings. We're beginning to see a return on the investments we have made in both enhanced content and functionality.\nThis performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business, which increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and 10% excluding the impact of the Euronext migration. Somewhat offsetting was slower growth in our end-of-day pricing business, where we're experiencing a slower sales cycle and pressure from asset-based revenues in our index business, which declined double digits year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets, such as equities and corporate bonds and into munis and treasury ETFs.\nFor the full year, total segment revenues totaled a record $2.1 billion, up 13%, while adjusted operating margins expanded by 500 basis points. As anticipated, recurring revenue grew 4% for the year and was up 5% after adjusting for Euronext.\nLet's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for 2/3 of segment revenues, totaled $164 million and grew 10% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes.\nImportantly, data and analytics revenues increased by over 30% year-over-year. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.1 billion, including a 16% increase in our recurring revenues and a 24% increase in our data and analytics revenues. And while industry volumes were actually below those seen 3 years ago in 2019, pro forma 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues are higher by nearly 50%, representing a CAGR of roughly 14%.\nI'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. Recurring revenues in 2023 will once again be led by our Mortgage Technology segment, where we are expecting mid- to high single-digit growth, a testament to the continued adoption of automation across the mortgage workflow. In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we expect recurring revenue growth, excluding headwinds, of approximately $15 million related to FX and the Euronext data center migration to once again be in the mid-single digits.\nAnd lastly, in our Exchange segment, we expect recurring revenue growth, excluding a $20 million headwind from the cessation of LIBOR, to be in the low single digits as continued growth in our energy exchange data services is offset by fewer IPOs and the tapering of 2021 initial listing fees.\nMoving to expenses. We expect 2023 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.04 billion to $3.09 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results and, therefore, expect cash compensation expense to increase by approximately $20 million to $40 million. Strategic investments in technology, operations and revenue-related initiatives are expected to increase by $40 million to $50 million, driven by higher license fees as well as investments across all 3 of our segments. In addition, we expect roughly $45 million to $55 million of incremental noncash expense, including $25 million of D&A related to the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. And lastly, we expect an FX benefit to our adjusted expenses by approximately $5 million to $15 million when compared to 2022.\nIn summary, we delivered another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. Across our business, we made strategic investments in future growth and as we enter 2023, we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, once again deliver profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take questions during Q&A but for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. 2022 was a year marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amidst this dynamic macroeconomic environment, we once again grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share, record results that are a testament to the resiliency and durability of our strategically diversified business model.\nIn our financial futures markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across the globe presented an interest rate environment that has not been seen in generation, helping us drive 20% volume growth in our interest rate complex and 15% growth in our equity derivatives business. Across our global energy markets, the events unfolding across North America, Europe, Russia and Asia have triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants to navigate.\nIn our global natural gas markets, an evolving energy supply chain in Europe has led to increased demand for global liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and has helped us drive a 17% increase in global gas volumes in 2022. This includes 24% growth in our North American gas business, which has benefited not only from increased commercial engagement with our Henry Hub contract, but also our North American basis markets. These trends have continued into January with global natural gas open interest up 14% year-over-year, including 21% growth in North America.\nAlthough our European carbon markets experienced headwinds in 2022 due to the aforementioned factors, the secular trend towards cleaner energy continues and is a growth trend we are uniquely positioned to capture, as evidenced by the record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 5% year-over-year in 2022. As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and as one of the largest providers of environmental products, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, renewable energy certificates as well as the wealth of climate data and related end-of-season analytics, we are excited about the many future growth opportunities that lie ahead.\nMoving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues in 2022. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, again a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Rising market uncertainty and interest rates are driving an increase in demand for credit protection, and we have seen this lead to increasing trading activity in our bonds business. These factors, coupled with our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms, continued to record full year revenues -- to record revenues in our ICE Bonds business in 2022, up nearly 100% year-over-year.\nTurning now to our Mortgage business, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues, which increased 16% in 2022. This continued strength is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate this analog to digital conversion.\nAs mortgage origination volumes have normalized, customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation. In the fourth quarter, we had our strongest quarter of last year in terms of sales to new customers of our loan origination system with wins across each major segment we service. In addition, there continues to be increased interest in our data and analytics products, which increased 31% in the quarter and 24% for the full year in 2022.\nThrough our AIQ solution and analyzer tools, customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our data and analytics tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I want to begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. As communicated, when making the announcement, we continue to believe that this transaction will close during the first half of this year. Out of respect for the Federal Trade Commission's work on this matter, and as we cooperate with them to gain regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain excited about the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.\nIn that vein, and shifting to what was yet another successful year, 2022 marked our 17th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy and more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies so that we're not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to provide upside exposure while hedging our downside risk.\nWe've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. The combination of these factors is what has made ICE an all-weather name and a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and, importantly, a business model that generates growth on top of growth.\nFor example, in 2022, inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity benefited our European and U.K. interest rate business, driving a 33% increase in revenues for the full year. These conditions also contributed to record full year revenues in our credit default swap clearing business, up 61% year-over-year, as rate volatility drove increased demand for risk management and credit protection.\nAcross our mortgage business, even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our business outperformed the broader market, driven by strong recurring revenue growth, up 16% for the full year. Again, this is a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we're positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes, and we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth.\nI'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2022, and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator, Alex, who will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nI'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.31, which is on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of 2021 and marked the best third quarter in our company's history. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues were flat on a year-over-year basis, our recurring revenues, which accounted for over half of our business, increased by 6% with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.\nThird quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $727 million and were $16 million below the low end of our guidance. These better-than-expected results were driven by favorable FX trends, continued operating efficiencies and a handful of nonrecurring items within professional services, SG&A and technology.\nShifting to the fourth quarter. We now expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $730 million to $740 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter largely reflecting the reversal of onetime items. As you begin to think about 2023 expenses, the midpoint of our current full year guidance or roughly $2.948 billion is a reasonable base to build upon. Despite the dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, the diversity and importantly, durability of our business has enabled us to invest through cycles. And while taking the current inflationary backdrop into consideration, we expect to once again invest in our people and the many medium- and long-term growth opportunities that exist across our expanded business.\nThird quarter adjusted operating income totaled $1.1 billion, up over 6% year-over-year and is on top of 13% pro forma growth in 2021, while adjusted operating margin expanded by nearly 180 basis points to approximately 60%. Through the first 3 quarters of 2022, adjusted free cash flow has totaled over $2.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter Exchange net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. In addition to higher levels of collateral at our clearinghouses and thus higher member interest revenues, this strong performance was driven by a 54% increase in our interest rate futures, a 23% increase in our equity derivatives and a 13% increase in cash equities and options revenues.\nImportantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of longer-term growth, ended October up 11% versus the end of last year, including 7% growth in energy and 18% growth across our financial futures and options complex.\nRecurring revenues increased by 5% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand for our energy exchange data and a continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance. While recent market volatility has led to a pause in new Listings business, both the backlog and our conversations with potential partners remains robust. And through the end of October, a record 19 corporations, representing a combined market cap of nearly $40 billion, have chosen to transfer to the NYSE.\nTurning now to Slide 6. In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, third quarter revenues totaled a record $534 million, a 14% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 84%, including 122% growth in ICE bonds and 75% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility and rising interest rates, customers allocating additional capital to CDS trading and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms.\nRecurring revenues, excluding the Euronext migration, grew by 4% in the quarter driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as double-digit growth in both our consolidated feeds business and our derivative analytics. Somewhat offsetting the strength were asset-based revenues in our index business, which declined by double digits year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets such as equities, munis and corporate bonds and into treasury ETFs.\nIn addition, extended fixed income market volatility is also impacting growth in a portion of our end-of-day fixed income pricing business as reduced new issuance has driven slower growth in the number of outstanding bonds available to be priced. Absent a sharp reversal of these macro trends, we'd expect fourth quarter growth to be similar to our third quarter performance.\nShifting to Mortgage Technology on Slide 7. Third quarter revenues totaled $276 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 60% of segment revenues and totaled a record $163 million in the quarter, increased 14% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes.\nImportantly, data and analytics revenue increased 22% year-over-year with underlying recurring revenue increasing by over 40%. Similar to last quarter, it's worth noting that industry unit origination volumes were similar to those in the first quarter of 2019. However, our third quarter 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues were over $100 million greater, growing at a CAGR of approximately 17% when compared to the pro forma revenues in 1Q '19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow.\nI'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8. Year-to-date, we've grown ICE revenue by 6%, adjusted operating income by 10% and our adjusted earnings per share by 9%, representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. Despite dramatically different macroeconomic environments, over a 3-year period, you will see a similar story of compounding growth with ICE revenues increasing at a CAGR of 8%, operating income at 11% and EPS of 12%, again, a testament to the resilience and durability of our platform and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to the balance of this year -- of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us and remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. In our financial markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. continued to drive increased hedging activity with interest rate average daily volumes increasing 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, including record Euribor futures.\nIn our equity derivatives complex, ADV in our MSCI complex was up 17% in the third quarter as volatility levels continue to be elevated versus the prior year. In our energy markets, the third quarter was marked with the confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that, when combined with high price volatility, made for a difficult trading environment. Despite these uncertain conditions, we have seen strength in areas like our options markets, our North American gas business and our North American environmental complex.\nOptions contracts are a valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions due to the ability to manage geopolitical tail risk and the lower associated capital requirements as we've seen historically. With open interest up 29% versus the end of last year, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid options markets to manage their risk.\nThe evolving energy supply chain in Europe is increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas sourced from the United States, driving price volatility in our North American gas markets. Our commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, contributing to a 23% volume growth in our North American gas business year-to-date and an all-time record in North American gas open interest as we have gained 500 basis points of market share over the past year versus our peers.\nFinally, although our European carbon markets are seeing headwinds due to the aforementioned factors, we continue to see growth in active participants in this market with participation up 7% year-over-year. At the same time, the secular trend towards cleaner energy is also driving growth in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. And because we offer the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows.\nImportantly, as we look out over the longer term, we believe that the 3 secular drivers across our energy markets remain intact: First, increasing energy demand; second, an evolving energy supply chain; and third, the clean energy transition. And because we operate deep liquid markets across the globe with benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy, we feel very well positioned to benefit from these factors.\nMoving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. We delivered record revenues, which grew 14% year-over-year. Our comprehensive fixed income and data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth underpinned by both our recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.\nTurning now to our Mortgage business. In the third quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues. The strength and resiliency that we've seen in recurring revenues has been driven by our new customers continuing to adopt our digital solutions, increased demand for our data and analytics tools and continued strong retention.\nOur customers remain focused on automation and efficiencies. This focus has led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, contributing to a 22% growth year-to-date in our data and analytics business. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools, customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process.\nWe are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to leverage our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. I want to start my prepared remarks by highlighting our vision of how ICE is contributing to both the U.S. home mortgage and U.S. equity markets to bring increased efficiencies to consumers in these 2 asset classes.\nTo take you back, ICE was initially founded to build and operate digital commodity exchanges. Modern digital exchanges provide an essential service, efficiently matching buyers and sellers with operational neutrality. Our modern exchanges are regulated. But more importantly, their growth and efficacy depend on the industry's trust of our neutrality. ICE does not take a position on the price of any commodity or security. We simply provide the software and network that efficiently facilitates a buyer and seller finding one another and allows them to determine their transaction price.\nToday, millions of traders, investors, brokers and regulators around the world are attached to our exchange networks. And they all benefit from the transparency and standardization that we enable. We followed up our launch into the exchange business by building digital data networks to disperse information separate from our exchanges, networks that thrive on the neutrality and confidentiality of our data management. It is likely obvious to you that our data networks would contain financial information generated by our own exchanges, but it may be less obvious that our growth has been accelerated by opening these networks to third parties, including most of our global exchange competitors who also access our customer base. Today, hundreds of third-party exchanges, brokers and market data generators publish their data to users across our networks.\nOur growth in the U.S. mortgage industry builds on the same management tenets: trust, transparency and neutrality. Our mortgage software and network are open and impartial. ICE has been at the forefront of building a mortgage platform so that industry participants can better communicate with one another, reduce their costs, pass these savings on to consumers in the form of better prices and appropriately implement the government's homeownership policies. And it is in this vein that we have agreed to acquire Black Knight to connect their market participants to ours, open up its platform, reduce cost per mortgage origination, overlay the safety and soundness practices that we've developed for businesses like the systemically important New York Stock Exchange and create new products and services for lenders to increase homeownership, including in underserved communities.\nAs a part of the budget that we previously guided you to, ICE plans a significant financial outlay to open and upgrade the Black Knight technology stack, a commitment that we believe would have been hard for Black Knight's other potential acquirers to make potentially in a contracting mortgage environment. This is the same strategy and commitment that we made when taking over the Mortgage Electronic Registrations System, which today has durable and scalable operations and technology built by ICE, systems that are prepared to manage the difficult risk environments in the U.S. housing market.\nAnd as shown on Slide 10, these MERS processes can identify and deregister failed lending firms who become zombies to borrowers and regulators.\nYou may have recently heard Sandra Thompson, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Director, lamenting how stakeholders in the mortgage manufacturing process seemingly lack the will to adopt technology that changes their entrenched methods. This is precisely the challenge that ICE is laser-focused on solving.\nGillian Tett pointed out in her book, The Silo Effect, that the U.S. mortgage industry is so siloed that the federal government's past attempts to help troubled homeowners stay in their homes by reducing mortgage payments actually exacerbated the foreclosure problem because lenders lowered monthly payments and servicers mistook this as consumers falling behind and initiated foreclosure proceedings. As Austin Gulsby once said, the silos were so strong, they did the exact opposite of what everyone expected.\nWith the explosive growth of the fintech industry over the last decade, the U.S. has seen a dramatic upsurge in the number of alternative home lenders and mortgage technology providers who, like ICE, are building solutions to benefit lenders and borrowers.\nSlide 10 also shows the number of new lending firms that just this year have registered to do business with MERS. And surprisingly, the number of lending firms have increased in a year where consumer demand for mortgages has decreased. This increased lender competition presents opportunities for ICE to take costs out of the mortgage manufacturing process so that these lenders can compete more effectively, passing no savings on to borrowers. The high cost of manufacturing and funding a home mortgage that we target are particularly acute for the most marginalized borrowers, which further exacerbates the wealth divide in the United States.\nOur acquisition of Black Knight remains subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission. ICE has provided the FTC with extensive information and certified its completeness. And as is often customary, we agreed to extend the FTC's statutory review period and intend to continue ICE's cooperation with the FTC staff. Our estimate is that the Black Knight merger will close in the first half of next year.\nWhile we'll be unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight, please note that our participation in this FTC review, coupled with the comprehensive conversations that we've been having with our customer base, has further convinced us that our merger will afford significant benefits to U.S. homeowners and industry stakeholders.\nAnd while on the subject of regulators, I'd like to comment on the recent remarks from the Securities and Exchange Commission focused on the structure of the U.S. equities market. In his June 8 speech, Chair Gensler noted the key elements of the national market system rules haven't been updated since year 2005. And since that time, the U.S. equity markets have become increasingly opaque. Today, most retail order flow is executed through off-exchange bilateral trading relationships with a small number of wholesalers. These wholesalers are able to trade against customers without exposing those orders to competition.\nIn some cases, wholesalers pay retail brokers for the privilege of this first look at their clients' order flow. This practice is known as price improvement, and it refers to occasions where trade is made at prices better than the national best bid and offer ticker displayed by the public exchanges, trades that often contain fractions less than 1 whole penny per share.\nWhat's often left out of this price improvement narrative, however, is the fact that public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange under current SEC rules are actually prohibited from displaying orders at price increments less than 1 whole penny. As a result, public investors are, in fact, prevented from narrowing the national best bid and offer ticker to sub-penny price increments.\nBut ask yourself this. Is the national best bid and offer ticker really the best market price that we should all be relying upon if investors can routinely buy a share of stock cheaper than what's displayed? We measure the opportunity for investor price improvement savings to the tune of $1.8 billion a year if there were a simple harmonization of the quote and trade increments across the entire market. We hope that this opportunity will be considered by the SEC.\nICE has been consistent in its strategy of promoting standardization, fair, transparent markets and networks using state-of-the-art technology. We embrace opportunities to transform businesses to create efficiencies and lower customer costs, not only in home mortgage, but even in a 230-year-old business like the New York Stock Exchange.\nI'll conclude my remarks on Slide 11. The third quarter of this year has been marked by rising inflation, fluctuating interest rates and central bank activity, concerns over energy and food security and global political uncertainty. And I can't think of any firm that has been better positioned to help manage these risks than ICE. Our customers rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to navigate through this environment.\nIn the third quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year reflect the all-weather nature of our business model. We have intentionally positioned the company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all-weather results.\nI'd like to end by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to this record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Charlie. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

My name is Victoria, and I will be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI'll now pass it over to Mary Caroline O'Neal, Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nMary Caroline O'Neal\n\nHead of IR, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nGood morning. ICE's second quarter 2022 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.\nToday's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2021 Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, as we announced in May, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is pending customary regulatory approval, and we expect to close in the first half of 2023.\nPlease note, this call does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.\nIn connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. When finalized, the definitive proxy statement prospectus will be sent to the stockholders of Black Knight, seeking their approval of the transaction and other related matters.\nBefore making any voting or investment decisions, investors and security holders of ICE and Black Knight are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement prospectus as well as any amendments or supplements to these documents because they contain important information about the proposed transaction.\nIn our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nThroughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.\nWith us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE.\nI'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nI'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32, a 14% increase year-over-year, marking the best second quarter in our company's history and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% versus last year, driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues, which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range. Versus the midpoint of our guide, second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX, various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs, particularly customer acquisition costs in our Listings business.\nMoving to the full year. We are lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion. Midpoint to midpoint, this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and, similar to our second quarter results, is driven by expense efficiencies, lower variable costs and favorable FX. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion, with our adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May, we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new senior notes. We used $3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and, along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear, reduced our commercial paper balances to zero. With no maturities until the middle of 2025, we entered the second half with a balance sheet that is well positioned amidst an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment.\nThe remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight. Based on the favorable rates that we secured on these long-term notes and the current forward of rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan, we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May, we maintained our A- and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter Exchange net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures and a 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, ended July up 11% versus the end of last year, including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex.\nSecond quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year. In July -- and in July, we successfully migrated the NYSE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume, a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise. Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data, continued benefit from our record 2021 Listings performance and a onetime accrual in our Listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half.\nTurning now to Slide 6. In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million, a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%, including 85% growth in ICE bonds and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers reengaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms, where we are seeing market share gains in our municipal bond business.\nRecurring revenue growth, which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues, grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated feeds business as well as continued growth in the ICE Global Network. Looking to the second half, we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue, supported by an ASP that enters the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And that second half, as reported recurring revenues, will be flat to slightly up versus our first half results, driven by Euronext data center migration, which was included in our original guidance, and $10 million of additional FX headwinds.\nShifting to Mortgage Technology on Slide 7. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for over half of segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter, increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers, this also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow.\nIt's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However, second quarter 2022 revenues in our Mortgage Technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q '19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth in customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow.\nI'll conclude on Slide 8. Through the first half of the year, we've grown total ICE revenue by 7%; adjusted operating income by 11%, including 200 basis points of margin expansion; and adjusted earnings per share by 12%, representing the best first half in our history. In addition, we positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us, and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile, the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly, we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.\nIn our interest rate markets, we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our Euribor contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and Central Bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex, driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date.\nAcross our global energy markets, customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer-term clean energy transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities.\nGlobalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past 5 years, driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark. Through the first half of this year, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, global gas markets have tightened significantly, increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes to increase 31% year-to-date, including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter.\nCommercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract, surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets.\nDespite these global energy concerns, governments, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities, such as placing a price on pollution, carbon-free electricity and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions and renewable energy certificates.\nThe breadth of our complex, coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency, has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past 5 years. As the Clean Energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmentals, alongside our gas and oil complexes, will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks.\nTurning now to our Mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said, when we made our announcement back then, we continue to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement and in accordance with our initial expected time line, we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction. Out of respect for the FTC's important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain very excited about the efficiencies the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.\nAs interest rates rise and mortgage origination volumes softened from recent record levels, our customers continue to turn to our mission-critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter, we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry. Our focus during these evolving market conditions is, first and foremost, our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation, and we continue to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network.\nFor example, we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eClose solution included in an Encompass subscription, making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies of an electronic closing. The focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products. Leveraging machine learning technology, our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process and can save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.\nYear-to-date, our data and analytics business, which is made up largely of recurring revenues, has grown 21% year-over-year. We continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming on to the platform with a host of new clients added this year alone, represented by the likes of Chase, a number of leading independent mortgage bankers and a top 3 homebuilder. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continue to rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to manage these risks.\nIn the second quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These record-setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all-weather nature of our business model. Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets, whether it was moving energy trading to the screen, clearing OTC swaps, modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets or building data sets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown, providing new markets to grow into and importantly, new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers.\nWe've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently, we combined our expertise in futures contract construction with our index capabilities and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE Mortgage Rate Lock Index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology, data sets and expertise.\nOur evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that, today, generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend, which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter.\nLooking now to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders. I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, following on the heels of our best first quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Victoria, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time."

Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 of the earnings supplement with some quick highlights from our first quarter results, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss the exciting transaction we announced yesterday afternoon.\nFirst quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 7% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.9 billion and increased 6% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 4%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 9%. Importantly, this is on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of 2021.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $746 million, in the middle of our guidance range. Had it not been for a few million dollars of severance, adjusted operating expenses would have been towards the low end of the range. Looking to the second quarter. We expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $740 million to $750 million. First quarter adjusted operating income increased by 9% to a record $1.2 billion, while free cash flow totaled $660 million, which we largely deployed in the form of share repurchases of $475 million.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide a quick overview of the performance of each of our segments. First quarter Exchange net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 36% increase in our interest rate futures and a 16% increase in our energy revenues. Revenues within our global natural gas and environmental products, which represent approximately 40% of energy revenues, increased by 30% in the quarter. Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE listings business, increased by 7% year-over-year, including 13% growth in listings.\nTurning now to Slide 6. In our fixed income and data services segment, first quarter revenues totaled a record $509 million, a 9% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 28%, including 9% revenue growth in ICE bonds and 33% growth in our CDS business, driven by rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 85% of segment revenues, grew by 6% in the quarter, once again, driven by double-digit growth in our index and consolidated feeds businesses and strong performance from our ICE Global Network and other data services businesses. And importantly, annual subscription value, or ASV, enters the second quarter up over 6% year-over-year.\nShifting to Mortgage Technology on Slide 7. First quarter revenues totaled $307 million. While total Mortgage Technology revenues declined year-over-year in the first quarter, we once again outperformed an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes, including an 80% decline in term refi volume. Recurring revenues, which accounted for over half of segment revenues, totaled $156 million and grew 24% year-over-year. As the mortgage origination backdrop continues to normalize, customers are in search of both automation and greater efficiency, a trend that contributed to one of the strongest sales quarters for our data and analytics product suite, including the implementation of our analyzers by JPMorgan Chase.\nIn addition, based on the strong performance through the first quarter of 2022 and the visibility we have into the current sales pipeline, we believe recurring revenue growth in our mortgage business is trending towards the high end of our low to mid-teens guidance range.\nIn summary, while a rapid rise in interest rates may have weighed on mortgage transaction volumes during the quarter, that same macroeconomic factor also provided a tailwind to our interest rate, commodity and fixed income businesses. And once again, alongside strong growth across our recurring revenue base, helped us deliver another record quarter for revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the all-weather nature of our business model.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're here to discuss the financial results of the best quarter in ICE's history, along with our plan to continue our track record of growth with our agreement to acquire the public company, Black Knight.\nBlack Knight is an important piece of financial market infrastructure that we believe will allow us to continue to reduce the cost of home borrowing when coupled to the other U.S. mortgage industry assets that we've built and acquired. This proposed acquisition is another step in a journey that ICE has embarked on since its founding.\nAs an early entrepreneur, I studied the exchange space. And I discovered that the largest exchanges all had one asset class in common, interest rates. And what became abundantly clear during the financial crisis was that hedgers who thought they had effectively managed risk using legacy interest rate products were doing so very imperfectly. Couple that with the analog-to-digital conversion that's been happening to markets more broadly, and we saw a powerful opportunity to redefine our Exchange business. And we've been diligently working on this thesis for more than 15 years.\nTo compete with hedging products in the corporate borrowing area, we acquired Creditex in 2008, married it with the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation in 2009, and launched a clear credit default swap market that this quarter generated $72 million of revenue and grew 33% year-over-year. We acquired the LIFFE Exchange in 2013, and revenue from its interest rate products, grew 36% in the quarter.\nWe acquired Interactive Data Corporation in 2015 and married it to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch credit and bond index business in 2017 to build tools and launch a powerful suite of corporate borrowing indices and reference data. We doubled the revenue growth in those businesses to an average annual rate of 6%.\nIn the consumer lending area, because the largest amounts of consumer borrowing are tied to home mortgages, we pursued opportunities in the U.S. mortgage space, acquiring the Mortgage Electronic Registry Service in 2018, Simplifile in 2019 and Ellie Mae in 2020. When coupled together, these technologies can offer lenders the potential to shorten the time that it holds interest rate risk market exposure from the time of the consumer rate lock until the time of wholesale funding, fundamentally changing the risk profile for lenders.\nAnd by leveraging our data expertise across the company, we recently created the ICE Rate Lock Index and have announced that we're launching a futures contract on it in the coming weeks, creating an even more precise interest rate risk management tool. Now by adding Black Knight to our solution set, we have the potential to further improve the capital markets ecosystem that surrounds the funding of U.S. home mortgages. Derisking these markets for participants by shortening the duration when interest rate risks are held, making data more transparent to the risk holders and creating more efficient hedging markets for those involved should ultimately lower the cost for the entire market.\nThere is no question that our thesis of producing better interest rate products and tools has been proven out as we've transformed the way risk is managed in the markets we serve. And our thesis continues to compound on growth as we innovate new interest rate hedging tools.\nSo let me now ask you to turn to Slide 6 of the ICE and Black Knight transaction deck. Yesterday afternoon, we announced that ICE has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or a market value of $13 billion. Consideration is expected to be in the form of a mix of 80% cash and 20% stock. And the transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year following its completion. Warren will discuss the financials in more detail, but first, I'll discuss the strategic rationale of this very exciting transaction.\nBlack Knight is a premier provider of integrated mission-critical software solutions and data and analytics that serve the U.S. mortgage and real estate markets. Black Knight's suite of solutions span across the mortgage workflow and are highly complementary to ICE's existing businesses. By expanding our solution set beyond originations, we will be able to deliver a life-of-loan platform that reduces friction and drives transparency across the workflow. The integration of our solutions will strengthen the overall mortgage ecosystem, bringing more choice and delivering efficiencies for lenders, servicers, partners and ultimately, the end consumer.\nThis combination will also expand the addressable market in our mortgage business to $14 billion and better positions us to penetrate our existing $10 billion TAM. Black Knight will complement our all-weather business model with a high growth and highly recurring revenue base.\nAnd finally, we will leverage ICE's technology expertise to modernize Black Knight's technology stack while tightly integrating our offerings to enable the many opportunities that are in front of us.\nTurning to Slide 7. Much like the history and culture at ICE, Black Knight's mission focuses on customer service and product excellence. The expansive product suite and compelling value proposition Black Knight brings to its customer base has enabled consistent revenue and EBITDA growth, a trend that we believe will only continue as a part of ICE.\nMoving now to Slide 8, you'll find a summary overview of our strategic rationale, which I'll discuss in more detail with the subsequent slides, beginning now on Slide 9. The opportunity we see in the mortgage space is much like the opportunities that we're executing against other interest rate markets and asset classes, by integrating data and technology across the entire workflow to bring greater transparency and efficiencies to the broader ecosystem.\nThe very manual loan origination process and its extensive regulatory oversight has driven the cost to originate a U.S. home mortgage to nearly $9,000 with approximately 1/4 of that amount being related to customer acquisition costs. As a result, more lenders are beginning to retain the servicing rights of the mortgages that they originate to recapture previous customers and reduce their acquisition costs. By connecting Black Knight's servicing system to the underwriting automation and consumer engagement solutions at ICE, we have an opportunity to create a life-of-loan platform that will enable lenders to realize a customer for life. This connection will lower the acquisition cost for lenders, enabling those savings to be passed on to the consumer.\nTurning now to Slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE. From our earliest days, we recognize the value of leveraging data to drive transparency. And we continue to build on that expertise by broadening our data sets, connecting data across asset classes and innovating for our customers. The data sets that exist across the complementary businesses of ICE and Black Knight present an untapped opportunity to apply that same playbook within home mortgage. With access to solutions such as Black Knight's MLS listing services and real estate data, we'll have a presence in the home search process.\nIn addition, there's an opportunity to leverage Black Knight's tax data and property valuation analytics to further enhance the underwriting process and provide our customers additional insights into rapidly changing market dynamics. We'll also have the opportunity to expand our existing ICE mortgage technology solution set into secondary markets, increasing the transparency for servicers and investors by enabling them to better understand their portfolio valuations, performance and risk. And by combining this rich data with ICE's expertise in fixed income and capital markets, we'll be able to provide even greater transparency to the fixed income markets through transaction-based data for more accurate pricing and prepayment modeling.\nTurning now to Slide 11. As we've demonstrated in our other asset classes, the integration of data and technology across the mortgage workflow should enable greater automation and, in turn, reduce friction to help lower the cost to originate a home mortgage for all parties, ultimately making a loan more affordable and accessible for the American home buyer.\nBy adding content to our consumer engagement solutions, we plan to provide consumers and investors greater clarity and insight into unique loan products and the key metrics that impact homeownership such as interest rate levels and lending policies, ultimately improving the overall home buying experience for the consumer. Lenders will also be able to proactively underwrite current customers for future home lending opportunities by helping consumers lower their housing payments by refinancing out of additional interest rate overlays or reducing their risk adjustments to the original mortgage.\nAnd leveraging common data sets across the entire mortgage cycle could reduce data entry errors and erroneous fees that today impact consumers directly. We also see an opportunity to develop innovative analytics, helping lenders connect with potential buyers in historically underserved markets and identify minority bias in the home valuation process. These are just a few of the many examples of the many opportunities that we see to leverage our data and technology to support potential homeowners and make the dream of home ownership a reality.\nMoving to Slide 12. The workflow efficiencies this combination will deliver underpin an expanded addressable market of $14 billion, including $2 billion from servicing solutions and an additional $2 billion within data and analytics. Our combined businesses will bolster our point-of-sale and consumer engagement solutions, enabling us to better serve that portion of our existing TAM. In order to provide you with additional transparency into this opportunity, we've separated this $2 billion addressable market from the application processing and underwriting segment, which here is largely made up of our loan origination technology.\nBlack Knight also brings capabilities that will allow us to access part of our existing TAM that we don't have a solution for today such as their hedging and trading platform. These capabilities, combined with our deep expertise in trading and clearing, unlock a longer-term opportunity to improve transparency for the secondary market participants in the form of a loan exchange. And finally, we'll be better positioned to monetize our current $10 billion TAM through opportunities to promote existing products across an expanded customer base.\nMoving to Slide 13. Black Knight's highly recurring, more predictable revenues will complement ICE's existing revenue streams and increase our mix of high-growth recurring revenues. Within ICE Mortgage Technology, our mix of recurring revenues will increase from roughly 50% to approximately 70%. And total ICE revenues will now be over 50% recurring on a pro forma basis. Importantly, these high-growth recurring revenues are underpinned by mission-critical data and technology that's embedded in our customers' workflows. And by adding more stable revenue streams to our current Mortgage Technology revenues, we will improve the visibility and durability of our earnings and cash flow, further complementing our all-weather business model.\nLet me now turn the call back over to Warren, and he'll discuss the financial details of today's transaction.\n\nA. Warren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Please turn to Slide 14. As Jeff noted, yesterday, we announced we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or a market value of $13 billion. The share price is in line with Black Knight's 52-week high just achieved on December 30, 2021, and represents a fully synergized EV-to-EBITDA multiple of approximately 15x forward.\nWe anticipate the transaction will be accretive to ICE's adjusted earnings per share in the first year post close with adjusted earnings accretion accelerating thereafter. Embedded within our purchase value are cost synergies of approximately $200 million with 1/3 realized in year 1, 2/3 by year 3 and 100% by year 5. These cost synergies are expected to be driven by the integration of corporate functions, real estate optimization and a more efficient use of shared services across the combined platform.\nWhen combined with the remaining Ellie Mae synergies, total expected cost synergies represent approximately 15% of the pro forma IMT Black Knight expense base.\nShifting to revenues. We have underwritten approximately $125 million of net revenue synergies by year 5, representing roughly 1% of our expanded $14 billion addressable market. These synergies will largely be driven by cross-sell of existing products across our expanded customer base. Transaction consideration will come in the form of 80% cash and 20% stock. We plan to finance the cash component through a combination of commercial paper, newly issued debt and cash on hand at the time of close, which we currently anticipate will be in the first half of 2023.\nGross leverage at close is expected to temporarily peak at approximately 4.1x pro forma EBITDA, which is below the 4.25 peak leverage we reached with Ellie Mae. We believe this financing structure demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. And as of this week, we've elected to suspend share repurchases until our leverage falls below 3.25x, which we anticipate will be towards the end of 2024. You will note on Appendix Slide 24 our strong track record of deleveraging post acquisition. As with Ellie Mae, we are targeting normalized leverage levels in the 2.75 to 3 range. We believe our enhanced cash flow generation will allow us to achieve this deleveraging path even as we continue to invest in our business and our people while also continuing to grow our dividend.\nMoving to Slide 15. Based on first quarter results and pro forma for Black Knight, we expect that our mortgage segment will represent approximately 30% of total ICE revenues compared to 16% previously. Recurring revenues within our mortgage segment are expected to account for nearly 40% of total ICE recurring revenues, while mortgage transaction revenues will represent only 10% of total ICE revenues.\nIn addition, upon close, we anticipate providing additional metrics to help investors better understand the progress we are making as a combined platform and the secular growth opportunities that underpin the analog-to-digital conversion occurring within the mortgage space.\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions in Q&A, but I'll first turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 16. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets. And we seek to do this smartly in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic and interest rate conditions so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story, something that does not exist in a single market or asset class alone.\nThis vision is one that we continue to organically build out ourselves. But one only has to look at our acquisition history, including my original acquisition of the founding company to ICE, to see that if valuable assets become available to us at prices that meet our disciplined M&A criteria, then we'll accelerate our build-out plans via acquisition. And through thoughtful integration, leveraging the infrastructure and expertise of the acquired company, we advance our vision and accelerate our goals to fundamentally transform the markets in which we operate. Our proposed acquisition of Black Knight is another important piece of this vision.\nI'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Betsy, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O'Neal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMary Caroline O'Neal\n\nHead of IR, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nGood morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com.

I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nWarren Gardiner\n\nCFO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.34, up 17% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and increased 10% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 11%, while total recurring revenues, which account for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%.\nFourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $749 million, slightly higher than expected, driven by additional severance as well as higher performance-based compensation due to the strong results to finish the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 14%, totaling a record $1.1 billion. This strong operating performance contributed to a record full year free cash flow of over $2.8 billion, of which we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while also reducing our gross leverage to 3x EBITDA, nearly a full year ahead of schedule.\nNow let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 71% increase in our interest rate business and a 29% increase in our energy revenues, both driven in part by rising inflation expectations. Revenues within our global oil complex increased 29% year-over-year, while natural gas and environmental products, which represent approximately 40% of our energy revenues, increased by 36% in the quarter and were up 20% for the full year.\nRecurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, increased by 8% year-over-year, including 10% growth in listings.\nTurning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $480 million, a 7% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 7% in the quarter.\nWithin recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 6% year-over-year, including another quarter of double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 7% driven by continued demand for our ICE Global Network and consolidated fees offering. For the full year, data services revenue increased by 6%. And importantly, annual subscription value, or ASV, enters the first quarter up 5.5%, setting us up for yet another strong year of compounding revenue growth.\nLet's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $346 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for over 40% of segment revenues, totaled $149 million and grew 26% year-over-year. While total Mortgage Technology revenues declined slightly, down 1% in the fourth quarter, we outperformed an industry that experienced a roughly 30% decline in origination volumes.\nFor the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues grew 17% on a pro forma basis, reaching $1.4 billion well ahead of our initial expectations and on track to achieve our target of more than doubling revenues over a 10-year period.\nI'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect full year total recurring revenues to be between $3.68 billion and $3.75 billion. This includes approximately $30 million of headwinds related to FX, the planned phaseout of sterling LIBOR and Euronext post-Brexit decision to migrate certain connectivity services away from our U.K. data center and on to the continent.\nIt is worth noting that the majority of Euronext connectivity revenues are expected to be offset by a related reduction in costs. Adjusting for these items, we expect core growth in our recurring revenues, which again account for half of our business, to be approximately 6% to 8% for the full year.\nThis strong growth, which is on top of 10% growth last year, is expected to once again be led by our Mortgage Technology business, which we expect will grow in the low to mid-teens and importantly, is on top of an exceptional 30% growth in 2021. In addition, and supported by an ASV that exits the fourth quarter up 5.5%, we anticipate another year of 5% to 6% growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenues.\nMoving to expenses. We expect 2022 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.04 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results and therefore, expect compensation expense, net of synergies and the resetting of 2021 performance awards, to increase by $25 million to $35 million.\nExpenses tied to revenues are also expected to increase by $25 million to $35 million driven by higher license fees as well as investments in business and product development across all 3 of our segments. In addition, we expect an incremental $40 million to $60 million in support of productivity and efficiency initiatives across our technology and operations groups, a portion of which we are electing to fund through the net operating savings we realized following the IPO of Bakkt.\nLastly, and similar to last year, we expect roughly $30 million of incremental D&A expense related to purchase accounting and the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. Please see Slide 12 in the appendix for a bridge reconciling our expense guidance to 2021.\nMoving next to capital allocation and consistent with our track record of growing our dividend as we grow, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 15% year-over-year from $0.33 per share to $0.38 per share. In addition, and now that we are within our targeted leverage range, we expect to deploy approximately $475 million towards share repurchases in the first quarter, representing a nearly 20% increase versus the second quarter of 2020, the last full quarter of buybacks prior to our acquisition of Ellie Mae.\nIn summary, we delivered a record finish to another record year. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also invested in an array of future growth initiatives, increased our dividend double digits and achieved our leverage target a year earlier than originally planned.\nAs we kick off 2022, we're focused on, once again, delivering growth and creating shareholder value against what is an ever evolving macro backdrop. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin R. Jackson\n\nPresident, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong financial results reflect the tremendous efforts of my colleagues across the organization, the trust and expanding relationship we have with our customers and the ability of our business model to drive growth across a variety of macroeconomic environments.\nI'd like to focus on the secular trends that are driving growth across our mortgage and energy markets. And we'll turn it over to Lynn to discuss our position across fixed income, data and analytics and some highlights from our great year at the NYSE.\nOur data, technology and network expertise position us well to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. As mortgage origination costs continue to increase, electronification is a trend we believe will continue in a variety of interest rate environments and regardless of mortgage origination volumes.\nOur ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues. Part of that growth is driven by our strategy to intentionally shift more business to recurring revenue. We also continue to see strong sales and new customers coming on to the platform.\nAnd with connectivity to nearly every participant in the mortgage industry, we have the opportunity to cross-sell new products like eClose and AIQ to a captive customer base seeking efficiencies. This flywheel effect and the secular trend of electronification give us confidence in our ability to grow this business and capture the $10 billion addressable market.\nAcross our energy markets, we achieved record volumes in 2021, including in Brent, TTF and environmentals. The breadth and depth of our platform not only drove strong volumes and revenues, but more importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex, including the globalization of natural gas in the clean energy transition.\nWe have built a global natural gas business, including our European marker, TTF. The globalization of natural gas and the rise of LNG have driven TTF to emerge as the global gas benchmark. And in 2021, record volumes on our platform grew 45% and drove revenue growth of 36%.\nOur markets continue to be relied on by an increasing number of participants to manage risk and navigate volatile gas and power markets. We were also early to diversify into environmentals, acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. And in 2021, we reached record volumes across the complex, including in our EU, U.K. renewable greenhouse gas initiatives and California carbon allowances.\nThese record volumes contributed to a 56% increase in environmental revenues versus the prior year. As customers navigate the uncertainty and volatility related to the clean energy transition, we are well positioned as the venue of choice to manage risk and provide price transparency across the energy spectrum.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn C. Martin\n\nPresident of NYSE Group and Chair of ICE Fixed Income & Data Services, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ben. With data and technology at our core, our goal is to provide solutions which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks such as ESG. We continue to increase the breadth and coverage of our products and accelerate the delivery of our ESG reference data to the NYSE issuer community, providing non-opinion-based insights to market participants.\nAnd in the fourth quarter, we expanded our climate change and alternative data capabilities with the acquisition of risQ and Level 11 Analytics. Combining geospatial data technology with our financial data will bring greater transparency to ESG risks across the financial markets, including our existing muni bond and mortgage-backed security offering. Our data, technology and leading marketplaces position us well to benefit from the secular trend towards sustainability and net zero carbon commitments.\nTurning now to fixed income. Increased automation, flexibility of delivery and passive investing continue to drive demand for our proprietary data and rapidly growing index business. As a leading data provider to the fixed income market, we are uniquely positioned to drive automation.\nLeveraging our proprietary evaluated prices, analytics and our growing suite of reference data, we've taken a business that historically served the back and middle office and created tools and analytics for the front office. These tools are critical to the pretrade transparency needed in the opaque, less liquid fixed income markets as is evidenced by our front-office tools continuing to grow double digits.\nThe growth in passive investing continues to be a tailwind for our business. The flexibility of our tools, quality of our pricing data and flexibility of our offering directly contributed to the 5 asset managers with funds of over $66 billion of AUM that transitioned to ICE indices during 2021 and an additional group of funds with AUM of $6.7 billion have planned transitions during Q1 2022. This strength drove double-digit revenue growth in our index business for the fourth consecutive year and positions us well for continued growth.\nI'll close with some highlights from the NYSE. 2021 was a record year for NYSE listings. We help connect innovators and entrepreneurs to nearly $120 billion in capital through 297 IPOs, including 3 of the 4 largest IPOs and the 3 largest tech IPOs. And importantly, we continue to lead the market in ETF listings with more than 65% of new funds selecting us as their home.\nWe also continue to prioritize our market-leading technology, which enables customers to better manage risk and provide our issuer community with significantly less volatility at the open and the close. The performance of our technology was proven as recently as last week when we processed nearly 0.5 trillion messages in a single day with median response times of less than 30 microseconds across our equities complex, further cementing our position as the leading equity exchange group. Our leading data and technology, coupled with our investments in sustainable finance, the secular trends across fixed income markets and the competitive differentiators of the NYSE, will continue to drive our growth well into the future.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Sprecher\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 10. 2021 marked our 16th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, a strategy that has made ICE an all-weather name, a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and importantly, a positioning that drives growth on top of growth.\nWe have intentionally diversified across asset classes so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or one macroeconomic environment. For example, in 2021, we saw record volumes across our energy complex driven in part by inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity. Our European and U.K. interest rate business also benefited from interest rate volatility, driving a 15% increase in revenues in 2021 and more recently, a 34% increase in our January revenues.\nOur CDS clearing business grew 14% in the fourth quarter as rate volatility increased, driving demand for risk management and credit protection. And even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our Mortgage Technology business outperformed the broader market, including pro forma recurring revenue growth in 2021, up 31%, again, a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model.\nAs we begin 2022, we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on investing and executing on the many growth opportunities in front of us.\nBefore we end our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2021, and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their continued efforts. Your hard work contributed to the best quarter in our company's history combined with other excellent results, making it the best year in our company's history.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Andrew, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

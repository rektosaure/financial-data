Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Home standby and portable generator shipments grew sequentially in the quarter, but were below seasonal expectations as a result of a power outage environment that was significantly below our long-term baseline average and the lowest third quarter of total outage hours that we've experienced since 2015.\nOn a year-over-year basis, overall net sales decreased 5% to $1.11 billion. Residential net sales declined 13% as compared to the prior year quarter with softness in home standby and portable generators, partially offset by strong growth in sales of residential energy technology solutions. Global C&I product sales also increased 9% during the quarter, led by growth in the domestic telecom and industrial distributor channels as well as international markets, which included the first shipments of our large megawatt generators to data center customers. Our significant momentum in the data center market has continued with our backlog for these products now doubling to over $300 million over the last 90 days, with even greater opportunities developing in our growing sales pipeline.\nNow discussing our third quarter results in more detail. Third quarter home standby shipments and activations increased sequentially from the second quarter but shipments decreased at a mid-teens rate on a year-over-year basis as a result of the significantly weaker outage environment in the current year period as well as the strong prior year period that included the benefit of multiple landed hurricanes. The historically low outage activity in the quarter was broad-based with all regions declining as compared to the prior year and resulted in portable generator sales also declining on a year-over-year basis. Home consultations for home standby generators also increased sequentially from the second quarter, but declined year-over-year during the third quarter. Although the seasonally higher levels of IHCs we would have normally seen did not materialize this year, home consultations held a solid baseline level with the ratio of home consultations to outage hours at the highest level since we began tracking these metrics more than a decade ago.\nWe view the relative resilience of the home standby category as further evidence of continued growing awareness for these products and the underlying demand we continue to see as representative of a new and higher baseline level following the elevated outage environment of 2024 despite the very low level of outages seasonally in the third quarter. Our expanded investments in our marketing and lead generation capabilities as well as our solid execution and optimization of promotional campaigns, also provided important support for the home standby demand during the quarter. Importantly, close rates improved substantially on a sequential basis and came in better than expected during the quarter with strong momentum continuing here in the month of October.\nWe remain focused on initiatives to support ongoing improvements in close rates such as further increased awareness of financing alternatives and optimize sales tools and training for our partners. We also attribute the recent improvement in close rates to a significant change in our approach to distributing leads to our dealers through the implementation of an enhanced data-driven process that allows our dealers to select or pull which leads they prefer to pursue as opposed to the previous push approach, which distributed leads directly to specific dealers based on certain criteria. The new lead process allows a wider pool of dealers with higher close rates the ability to select which leads they believe they have capacity to address.\nWe believe the resulting improvement in close rates will further optimize our customer acquisition costs and lead to a broader distribution of sales leads across our residential dealer base. Our residential dealer network continued to expand during the quarter as our dealer count reached nearly 9,400, an increase of approximately 100 from the prior quarter and an increase of nearly 300 dealers over the prior year. We view this continued strength in contractor interest in the product category as evidence of the growing underlying demand for backup power solutions despite the softer outage environment. In addition, our aligned contractor program, which targets contractors that purchase our products through wholesale distribution has also continued to grow and provides for incremental engagement, training and installation bandwidth through this important distribution channel.\nAlso during the third quarter, we began the initial shipments of our next-generation home standby generator product line, which represents the most comprehensive platform update for the category in more than a decade. The new product rollout will continue in the fourth quarter with our first shipments of the higher end of the product range, including the market's first 28-kilowatt air-cooled home standby generator. This new product line features the lowest total cost of ownership available driven by reduced installation and maintenance costs as well as introducing industry-leading sound levels and the best fuel efficiency of any residential generator on the market today.\nThe next-generation platform, together with our new Field Pro application also offers a number of important benefits for our channel partners, including significantly lower commissioning times and improved remote diagnostics, enabling operational efficiencies for their businesses and greater uptime and cost savings for their customers.\nMoving to Residential Energy Technology Solutions. Sales of these products and services outperformed our expectations once again and grew at a significant rate during the quarter, led by shipments of energy storage systems in Puerto Rico. Our team continues to execute extremely well alongside our partners on this energy grant-related program, which is expected to drive continued strong residential energy technology sales growth into the fourth quarter. Our ecobee team continued to drive that business forward and delivered another profitable quarter with significant gross margin improvement and operating leverage as a result of continued strong sales growth and disciplined cost control.\nAdditionally, ecobee's installed base grew to approximately 4.75 million connected homes with increased energy services and subscription sales supporting a growing high-margin recurring revenue stream. We expect ecobee to deliver positive EBITDA contribution for the full year, a key milestone for the strategically important part of our business. As we begin launching new energy storage, microinverter and home standby products that are integrated with the ecobee's platform during the second half of this year, we are intent on delivering a premium feature set and user experience, which we believe will be an important differentiator for our growing residential energy ecosystem.\nWe also made significant progress in our solar and storage product development efforts during the third quarter as we began shipping Power Cell 2, our next-generation energy storage system and introduced Power Micro, our solar microinverter that will begin shipping by the end of this year. As we close out 2025, we are focused on leveraging these new products as well as our distribution and marketing capabilities to drive market share gains and significant sales growth in the future. As appropriate, however, we intend to recalibrate our investment levels to reflect the completion of our energy grant program in Puerto Rico and to adjust for a broader market environment that is likely to contract in 2026 as a result of the substantial reduction in federal incentives for solar and storage technologies.\nAlthough we see this market contracting in the near term, we believe that the secular trends of rising power prices and declining component costs are creating a situation where the economics of residential solar and storage technologies will provide for an attractive long-term market opportunity regardless of the level of government incentives.\nNow let me provide some additional commentary on our commercial and industrial product categories, where we continue to see year-over-year sales growth, which accelerated during the third quarter. In particular, sales to our domestic industrial distributor customers increased at a solid rate in the period as we further reduce the lead times for our C&I products. Our teams have been working hard to increase production rates over the last 18 months, by bringing our new facility in Beverdam, Wisconsin online earlier this year. And as a result, we have successfully brought our lead times down to more historically normal levels.\nIn addition to our operational execution in the quarter, our efforts to further develop our distribution partners, both owned and independent have helped to expand our share of the domestic backup power generation market over the last several years. In addition to the growth in our industrial distribution channel, shipments to national telecomtomers also grew at a robust rate in the third quarter compared to the prior year as part of the ongoing recovery for this important challenge 2025. We continue to expect the growing dependence on wireless communication and additional infrastructure required enhanced reliability to provide a solid backdrop for secular growth in sales of C&I products to our telecom customers into the future.\nMobile product shipments of national and independent rental customers outperformed our prior expectations and increased on a sequential basis, which we view as signaling the beginning of a recovery for this market. We anticipate favorable momentum to continue building in the coming quarters in our mobile products, and we continue to believe we are well positioned for long-term growth given the mega trend around the infrastructure-related investments needed both domestically and internationally that leverage our global portfolio of mobile products.\nInternationally, total sales increased 11%, driven by continued strength in C&I product shipments in Europe and the first shipments of our large megawatt generators to a data center customer in Australia. International sales continue to benefit from the favorable impact of foreign currency, which we expect will continue in the fourth quarter. Additionally, international EBITDA margins expanded at a strong rate from the prior year due to favorable sales mix. Our initiative to penetrate the large and rapidly growing data center market continued to gain momentum with initial shipments in international markets beginning during the third quarter. And as we saw our global backlog of large megawatt generators for this important end market doubled to more than $300 million over the last 90 days.\nThe first domestic shipments of these new large output generators began here in the month of October, and we are projecting strong sequential growth in sales to the data center end market during the fourth quarter. The large majority of our backlog is expected to ship in 2026, providing a meaningful tailwind for overall C&I product growth in the coming year. Importantly, we continue to develop a robust pipeline of new opportunities within the data center market that represents significant upside for our C&I product in 2027 and beyond.\nData center power demand is forecasted to grow at a significant rate for the foreseeable future. And the high uptime requirements of these facilities drives backup power needs in excess of site electricity consumption. Third-party estimates suggest that global data center power demand will cumulatively grow by more than 100 gigawatts over the next 5 years. with the potential for incremental annual capacity additions to double by the end of this decade. Additionally, further global market opportunities exist for large megawatt generators within our traditional end markets, in particular, providing backup power for large manufacturers, cold chain distribution centers, health care facilities and other critical infrastructure that have higher backup power requirements.\nGiven the existing supply constraints within the high end of the C&I backup power generator market, large megawatt generators represent a massive opportunity for Generac as a long-standing well-known participant in the C&I backup power markets. In addition to our highly competitive lead times, we believe that our strong reputation as an engineering-driven organization that is uniquely focused on backup power with a customer-centric approach and world-class service capabilities will allow us to gain share in the data center backup power market as well as our traditional end markets. Given the momentum in our sales pipeline and the significant incremental market opportunity we see in the future, we have been actively exploring further investments to aggressively expand our competitive positioning and increase our capacity and capabilities for these products.\nWe expect to undertake several important capacity expansion-related projects and investments during the fourth quarter. to position Generac as a significant producer of these products well beyond 2026 and to support what we believe could be a potential doubling of our C&I prop sales over the next 3 to 5 years. In closing this morning, our third quarter results and our lower residential sales outlook reflect a historically weak power outage environment. However, the mega trends that support our future growth potential remain intact as lower power quality and higher power prices will be an ongoing challenge given the more frequent and severe weather patterns as well as broader electrification trends. And at the same time, the massive increase in data center power data center power demand is expected to further stress the already fragile power grid by amplifying the growing electricity supply demand imbalance.\nAdditionally, we're entering a period of unprecedented growth for our C&I products. as the expansion of our product line to include large megawatt generators has allowed for our entry into the rapidly growing data center market. As a leading energy technology company, we believe Generac is uniquely positioned at the center of these megatrends that have the potential to drive substantial and sustainable growth in the years ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on third quarter results as well as our updated outlook for 2025. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2025 results in more detail. Net sales during the quarter decreased 5% to $1.11 billion as compared to $1.17 billion in the prior year third quarter. The combined effect of acquisitions in foreign currency had an approximate 1% favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. We believe looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class. Residential product sales decreased 13% to $627 million as compared to $723 million in the prior year.\nAs Aaron discussed in detail, a significantly lower power outage environment as compared to the prior year, relative in a decline in home standby and portable generator shipments. This was partially offset by robust year-over-year growth in sales of Energy Storage Systems and Ecobee Home Energy Management solutions. Commercial & Industrial product sales for the third quarter increased 9% to $358 million compared to $328 million in the prior year. Core sales growth of approximately 6% was driven by an increase in shipments to our domestic telecom customers, together with a strong growth in Europe and initial shipments of our new large megawatt generators to a data center customer in Australia, partially offset by continued weakness shipments to national rental accounts.\nNet sales for the other products and services category increased approximately 5% to $129 million as compared to $123 million in the third quarter of 2024. Core sales increased approximately 3%, primarily due to growth in ecobee and remote monitoring subscription sales and other installation and maintenance services revenue, partially offset by a reduction in parts and accessory shipments given the lower outage environment. Gross profit margin was 38.3% compared to 40.2% in the prior year third quarter, primarily due to unfavorable sales mix, together with the impact of higher tariffs and manufacturing under absorption, partially offset by increased price realization as a result of price increases implemented earlier in the year to address the impact of incremental tariffs.\nOperating expenses increased $20.2 million or 6.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of certain legal and regulatory charges in the current year as disclosed in the accompanying reconciliation schedules. Excluding these items, which are not indicative of our ongoing operations, operating expenses decreased $0.6 million or 0.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests as defined in our earnings release, was $193 million, 17.3% of net sales in the third quarter as compared to $232 million or 19.8% of net sales in the prior year. This margin decline was primarily driven by the previously mentioned unfavorable sales mix and the operating expense deleverage on the lower sales volumes.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 8% to $938 million in the quarter as compared to $1.02 billion in the prior year, including approximately 1% sales growth contribution from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $166 million, representing 17.7% of total sales as compared to $212 million in the prior year or 20.7%. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased approximately 11% to $185 million in the quarter as compared to $167 million in the prior year quarter, including an approximate 3% benefit from foreign currency. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $27 million or 14.8% of total sales as compared to $20 million or 12.2% in the prior year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2025 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $66 million as compared to $114 million for the third quarter of 2024. The current year quarter includes an unfavorable Wallbox fair market value mark-to-market adjustment of $5.7 million and a loss on refinancing of debt of $1.2 million related to our Term Loan A and revolver amend and extend transaction that closed in July 2025. Our interest expense declined from $22.9 million in the third quarter of last year to $18.5 million in the current year period as a result of lower borrowings and lower interest rates relative to prior year.\nGAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $11.8 million or an effective tax rate of 15% as compared to $33.5 million or an effective tax rate of 22.7% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by favorable discrete tax items in the current year quarter related to certain return to provision adjustments that did not occur in prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.12 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $1.89 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $108 million in the current year quarter or $1.83 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $136 million in the prior year or $2.25 per share. Cash flow from operations was $118 million as compared to $212 million in the prior year third quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $96 million as compared to $184 million in the same quarter last year. The change in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in inventory levels during the current year quarter and lower operating income which was compounded by a decline in inventory levels during the prior year quarter. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio of 1.8x on an a reported basis.\nWith that, I will now provide comments on our updated outlook for 2025. As discussed by -- as discussed in detail by Aaron, the extremely low outage environment in recent months has resulted in lower demand for home standby and for generators and a reduction in our full year 2025 outlook for overall net sales growth. We now expect consolidated net sales for the full year to be approximately flat compared to the prior year, which includes an approximate 1% favorable impact from the combination of foreign currency and acquisitions. This updated outlook compares to our previous guidance of plus 2% to 5% net sales growth over the prior year.\nLooking at product classes. We now project full year 2025 residential product sales to decline as compared to the prior year in the mid-single-digit percent range, while C&I product sales are expected to increase as compared to the prior year, also in the mid-single-digit percent range. The resulting sales mix shift is projected to have an unfavorable impact on gross and adjusted EBITDA margins for the year as compared to our prior guidance. Specifically, we now expect gross margin percent for full year 2025 to be approximately flat to slightly down compared to the full year 2024 levels. This represents a nearly 1% decrease from our prior expectation of approximately 39.5% as a result of the previously mentioned unfavorable sales mix and lower manufacturing absorption given the lower residential production volumes, together with incremental new product transition and Siena plant start-up costs, are transitory in nature. Additionally, this gross margin guidance assumes that current tariff levels that are in effect today stay in place for the remainder of the year.\nLooking at our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations for the full year 2025, given the factors impacting our gross margins, together with additional operating expense deleverage on the lower sales volumes, we are reducing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA percent to approximately 17%. This is compared to our previous guidance range of 18% to 19%. Additionally, as a result of higher use of cash for primary working capital and capital expenditures, free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income is now expected to be approximately 80% for the full year 2025 as compared to the previous guidance range of 90% to 100%. This would still result in approximately $300 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2025, which provides for near-term optionality to allow for additional investments to drive future growth as part of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation framework.\nAs is our normal practice, we're also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2025. For full year 2025, our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 20% to 20.5%, down from our prior guidance of 23% to 23.5% due to the lower realized third quarter tax rate. Specifically for the fourth quarter 2025, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using this 25% effective tax rate. We now expect interest expense to be approximately $70 million to $74 million for the full year 2025, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year. This compares to our previous guidance of $74 million to $78 million and contemplates lower interest rates and outstanding borrowings than previously assumed.\nOur capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately 3.5% of forecasted net sales for the full year 2025, a 0.5% increase from prior guidance as a result of incremental CapEx investment for data center capacity expansion expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. Depreciation expense, GAAP intangible amortization expense and stock compensation expense are expected to remain consistent with last quarter's guidance. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to be approximately 59.4 million to 59.5 million shares as compared to 60.3 million shares in 2024. Finally, this 2025 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value during the year. This concludes our prepared remarks.\nAt this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

We have always said those events are, you know, between $50 million and $100 million impact. We saw that play out pretty much on point last year. We would say that that would probably be the situation again this year. I might say the only difference might be we have done a really nice job in portable generators. We have got a new team there that is leading that business, that part of our business, those products. They have done a great job getting some really major wins at some incredible retailers and expanding our shelf space. We are feeling really good about where we sit from a market share standpoint in portable gens.\n\nIf we were to get some major outages, we might actually have a nicer tailwind there. We are going to be set from an inventory standpoint, a little bit of, you know, the cash flow in the quarter, you know, in terms of our working capital needs in Q2. We are driven by kind of replanting portables, a heavy storm season from last year, but also getting ready for this year's storm season and the fact that we have got increased placement in the retail channel with those products. What the market is telling us around home standby, though, is, you know, it is and it has always been kind of a regional story. The Southeast remains pretty robust, right? Coming out of last year, the activity there is great. There are other parts of the country where it is weaker because we have not had the outage activity.\n\nI think if you stand back and you look at it on a whole and you look at kind of the home standby business or the products there as a segment or as a group, it has been incredible how it continues to grow. After every one of those major events like we had last fall, it holds on to that higher baseline level and it grows from there. Now, it might be slower growth for a little bit of time here until we see another inflection point with more outages, but it is an incredible part of our business in terms of the ability to grow that business on the back of outage, high-profile outage events, and then to hold on to that growth and move from there. Really pleased with kind of how that business has continued to pace.\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nBrian.\n\nHey, good morning. Can you just talk about pricing? We had the 7% to 8% increase, I guess, in March. I know you said that it had some positive impact on gross margin, but how is that received overall in the market? Any effect on demand? How are you adjusting your plan for pricing on the new product line given how tariffs have evolved?\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Brian. Pricing, you know, obviously dynamic environment we are in. We are all kind of glued to the 24-hour news cycle here on where these trade agreements are coming out. It sounds like the administration is making progress here. You know, it is slow going. Obviously, these are major deals and, you know, it takes time to get these deals put together. But I think in the end, you know, we put price into the market in response to what we understood the tariff environment to be. Those were effective. I think at the beginning of April, that was roughly the 7% to 8%, Brian, that you referenced there. I am talking specifically now about the home standby impact there. Did not see much material impact on demand.\n\nWe did, just to remind you, you know, we had our updated guidance at the time, did contemplate some demand destruction on higher price for the remainder of the year. So, you know, there is some demand destruction that we built in. And, you know, I think we have largely, based on our results, I think it is kind of played out the way that we saw it playing out. The second part of your question, kind of where are we going from here? We have a new product line coming out in the second half of the year. It is our next generation home standby product line, which is, it is phenomenal, actually. The product itself is just so far advanced from even the existing platform and so far ahead of where the market is at today. We are super excited about that.\n\nThere is a bit more cost in that product with some of the feature sets that we have added, which is good, but that will require some additional pricing adjustments. And of course, we have got some new, you know, we have got additional knowledge on the tariff, the trade deals that have been inked so far and where we are sitting. So, you know, there is probably, as we release product into the market, we just announced the availability of our new 14 kilowatt and 18 kilowatt units. That is the first part of the new product line to be released. Those just went on order here this week, as a matter of fact, early this week. The order book opened on those and we will begin shipping those next week.\n\nAnd those contain a price increase somewhere in the, you know, depending on the SKU in the mix, 5% to 7%, call it, of additional price that will go in related to, you know, that kind of, you know, again, mostly because of the additional feature sets that we are including with the products. There's a little bit of kind of rebalancing with some of the tariff information that is now known that wasn't known back when we did the last round of pricing in April. We still have a good chunk of the product line to be released here in the second half of the year, our larger nodes. So everything from the 20 kilowatt nodes all the way to the 28 kilowatt nodes, which represents an important part of that product offering. We haven't released pricing on those nodes yet. We'll continue to watch the tariff environment.\n\nWe may have to go back and touch pricing again on the 14s and 18s if something changes, but probably not material at this point. It's probably small. We feel pretty good about where we're sitting with respect to pricing and, again, the demand destruction, if you want to call it that, that may have occurred. We think that played out largely in line with our guide.\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Mark Strouse of J.P. Morgan. Mark, your line is open.\n\nThank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. Going back to the data center opportunity, can you just kind of talk about the backlog that you have so far in the initial conversations that you are having? Are those with kind of larger hyperscaler type data centers? Are they more traditional data centers? Any color there you can provide? Then going back, Aaron Jagdfeld, to your comments about potentially expanding capacity, can you just talk about kind of looking at your footprint, looking at your supply chain, other factors that go into that? How, I do not want to use the word easily, but, how quickly can that be done? Can you talk about the CapEx requirement, if you are going to double capacity, triple capacity, whatever it ends up being, how we should be thinking about that? Thank you.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Mark. So, just on the pipeline, our opportunities include both, you know, the, I would call it traditional data center owner-operators as well as hyperscalers. But where we are getting traction is with the hyperscalers because their power needs are greater. Frankly, that is where the biggest part of the deficit in the market seems to exist is around those. But it is a market-wide deficit in terms of supply versus demand. So, we are seeing those opportunities manifest across the board. We are having, I would say, some of our more interesting conversations are with the hyperscale side of the business. We are not just talking about 2026 planning with these customers. We are talking about 2027 and beyond at this stage because they are planning out, obviously, they are trying to lock up supply further out.\n\nThey are, you know, I mean, they are out 2027, 2028, some cases 2029, the conversations are out. Then the second part of your question on footprint. We have nine facilities around the world that are capable of producing commercial and industrial products. So, we have three here in the U.S. We have one in Mexico, one in Brazil, one in India, one in China. We have a facility in Italy and a facility in Spain. I think that is nine if I did my math right. So, those facilities are capable of producing CNI products. Not all of them are capable of producing the large megawatt products. But what I would say is by expanding capacity in the mid-range of our products, we are able to create additional capacity opportunities for large megawatt. I will give you an example.\n\nHere in North America or here in the U.S., we just opened a new plant here in Wisconsin. Our biggest plant in the U.S., 345,000 square feet in Beaverdam, Wisconsin. We just commissioned that plant back on April 1st, cut the ribbon on it locally here just this past last week. So, that plant is operational. What that plant allows us to do, it is focused on our mid-range gen sets up to basically up to one megawatt. So, that is going to be more of our traditional market and markets like telecom, you know, and some of our traditional backup markets.\n\nBut what it allows us to do is take a product that we are currently manufacturing, those higher output products that we are currently manufacturing in one of our other facilities nearby, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and free that facility up to be focused not quite 100%, but close to the opportunities that exist with these large megawatt units. By the very nature of that, we have added a lot of capacity in the system by bringing this new plant on, even though the new plant was not maybe aimed directly at the large megawatt product. That plant that we just brought online was about a $65 million to $70 million investment all in.\n\nAs we think about, it took us about 15 months to bring the plant on, 12 to 15 months, depending on, it was actually closer to 12 months than 15 to bring it up to speed and to get it constructed and get it going. As we think about the future, and again, 2026, we are fine. We have plenty of capacity. We are well over the 150 million backlog we have, and we are going to get orders of magnitude over that in terms of what our raw capacity is globally for these large systems. When we think about the opportunity that exists for 2027, 2028, and beyond, I want to get ahead of this, and I want to get ahead of it now. We are going to have to take and make some big bold bets on additional capacity, and that could come through organic efforts.\n\nWe could build some factories, we could buy some buildings. We can do some things there that are frankly in our wheelhouse in terms of, again, I referred to this in my prepared remarks, but our core corporate agility, one of them is our core corporate value is agility. We just move fast at the company. We know how to do that. We are comfortable with that. It is a legacy of serving kind of, honestly, it comes from our residential side of our business. It is a legacy of being able to react to exogenous events that happen. We think that our supply chain, we have great partnerships built in the supply chain for these large megawatt units, and they are prepared. They have got a lot of capacity already. They are prepared to add more.\n\nWhat we need to do is continue to look at all elements of the value chain there, end to end, to make sure that there are not other constraints that exist. If there are, how do we solve for them? This is going to be an all-out effort by the company to figure out how we grow this segment of our business very, very quickly in the years ahead. It is going to come, we are going to need to invest. The good news is we have a really great balance sheet. We generate a lot of cash flow. We generate $400 million this year.\n\nWe've got a head of steam.\n\nWe have got a head of steam in terms of our momentum going forward here with our backlog. We feel like we are well positioned to, maybe you want to call it, a rotation of investment, somewhat out of some of the energy technology things we have been focused on and into this CNI opportunity, which we just think we can win there with our approach. We are super excited about that.\n\nOur next question will be coming from Keith Housum of North Coast Research. Your line is open, Keith.\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for the opportunity here. I hope you guys could perhaps just dimensionalize a little bit the current industry capacity for these data centers. You mentioned a deficit of about 5,000 devices. How much can the market do today? Then perhaps, what is your capacity? Is it, you know, 300 million, 400 million as you guys currently have it built?\n\nYeah. Thanks, Keith. The overall market size, again, there are a lot of moving pieces there, but it is significantly above the 5,000 deficit, obviously. But it continues to evolve. A lot of that is going to be defined by how quickly the data centers can come online. One of the challenges that still has to be solved by the data centers is the ability to connect to the grid, right? So what we are seeing, and I think what you, for those of you who track some of the companies in the marketplace that provide different solutions for what we refer to as bridge power, right?\n\nMaybe unique solutions, individual solutions that can create a somewhat independent, almost microgrid, if you will, for a data center site so that they can operate independent of the grid and they can stand up that data center and bring it online more quickly. Those solutions are also, there are capacity constraints within those solutions as well. So a lot of the overall size of the market is being dictated by how quickly can these data centers be put into service, either by connecting to the grid or through their self-sufficiency with some kind of bridge power solution until they can connect to the grid. So it is a moving number. It is a moving target.\n\nAgain, the 5,000 deficit that we referenced is kind of based on what the individual market participants have told us that they believe, and not market participants in terms of gen set participants, but the customers for data centers, what they believe to be a deficit in the market. So they are not telling us how big the whole thing is. They are just saying they believe there are thousands and thousands of units short here, even for 2026. Our own capacity, you are just kind of looking at what we think we can do in terms of capacity for next year.\n\nI think it is easily north of $500 million in terms of what we have as capacity today, based on the nine facilities we have, based on bringing Beaverdam online here this year, and also some expansion that we are doing, investing in some areas in some of our other plants to allow them to do even more, to expand their capacity of large megawatt product in particular, either through additional test capacity, which is generally the constraint, or through some of the other production capacity. What we need to do is size that with our supply chain as well. We think right now our supply chain could keep up with that. This is where I think real quick, very quickly, you think about $500 million. That is a third of our entire CNI business today.\n\nIt is, again, I keep using the term needle moving because that is truly a needle moving opportunity. The good news is, we have got good capacity in place. We have got, as York Ragen mentioned, momentum with our backlog, and we are willing to commit to additional capacity as the market grows and as our participation grows alongside of it.\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Dimple Behzai of Bank of America. Dimple, your line is open.\n\nThank you. I appreciate the time today. You raised EBITDA margins to 18% to 19% from 17% to 19% previously. My question is, what is driving the confidence in margin expansion? How much of this is due to structural improvement, say in input costs or temporary tailwinds from mixed pricing as opposed to uplifts from tariffs? How sustainable are these margins into 2026?\n\nNo, I think what we've been, our gross margin performance has been quite strong, I would say, for the last four quarters. We've demonstrated that we can execute on strong gross margins. That alone gives us confidence that that can continue on. From a tariff standpoint, the market has absorbed the pricing. You can see from our Q2 performance that we were able to withstand that. We believe in the second half, we will continue that. We have got confidence that the impact of tariffs will get offset by price and that will allow us to hold those strong margins. I think the increase from our prior outlook is just a function of holding those margin dollar levels on slightly lower sales, on slightly lower pricing. That alone will drive your margins up. What we have seen today is we believe we can offset those tariff impacts.\n\nI would say, I would add to that, Dimple, that when you think about longer-term margins, again, as we continue to focus on reducing the drag from some of the energy tech products that we talked about earlier, and then as that CNI business begins to rapidly grow, the leverage that we are going to get from that growth is going to also be, I think, a positive overall for our margins. So the combination of those two factors as well gives me confidence longer term that our margins have the opportunity to continue to expand. We had laid that out also at our last IR event. We were targeting higher margins even than where we are operating today, and we believe that that is still very achievable.\n\nThat is even kind of before we get to some of the potential opportunities within the data center market that we have been talking about this morning.\n\nDefinitely on the EBITDA line.\n\nOn the EBITDA line.\n\nYeah, those operating leverage on the EBITDA line will be large.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Sean Milligan of Generac Holdings Inc. Your line is open.\n\nThank you for taking the question, guys. In terms of the data center piece, you just kind of hit on it, but I was trying to understand how we should think about margins for that book of business. Are they, I guess, both from a gross and EBITDA side within the CNI piece, like are they going to drag that margin profile higher over the next couple of years also?\n\nI think at the gross margin line, if you just looked at those projects on their own, they do not look tremendously different than our CNI product margins. They are maybe a little bit softer than that on a percentage basis, but actually, they are quite a bit stronger than our initial business case going into this market presented. We thought that those percentages would be more challenging and they would be potentially dilutive at the gross margin line. I do not necessarily see it happening that way with CNI products now, given where, because of the structural deficit in the market, pricing of those products to the market has gone up from our initial business case and is putting us in a place with gross margins on those products that look a lot more like our traditional CNI products.\n\nAs a result, even if we were to do the business case that we, if we were to talk about the business case we originally had, we were going to see accretion on the EBITDA margin line because of that leverage. We are going to see it is going to work out even better now because the gross margins also will be stronger than we had initially planned for, and you will get the leverage on the operating leverage at the EBITDA margin line. So net-net, Sean, I think this is again where kind of my previous answer to Dimple's question, why I have got confidence that our EBITDA margins can continue to expand in the future is in particular on the back of what we are looking at doing here in data centers.\n\nEven on a consolidated basis.\n\nEven on a consolidated basis.\n\nMaybe slightly, maybe dilute about the gross margin line on a consolidated basis, but accretive to EBITDA margin.\n\nAccretive on a consolidated basis, EBITDA margin for sure.\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question, which will come from Joseph Osher of Guggenheim Partners. Joseph, your line is open.\n\nHi. Thanks. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about your diesel sourcing strategy. I am wondering whether, you know, for starters, that supply chain is showing some signs of stress as well, given how busy data centers are and also how you are thinking about where you might procure, in particular, what your opportunities are outside of China. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Joe. It's a great question because obviously at the heart of every one of those machines is what we refer to as a large board diesel engine that produces the kind of output that is required in each of these machines. These are engines that have been around a long time, but they've been traditional, and they've been used in power generation in the traditional market sense. Typically, you see them in rail, you see them in mining, you see them in marine, in those larger power applications. When you look across the planet, there are a handful of manufacturers of these large diesel engines. A couple of them are very well known, Caterpillar, Cummins, and they also have very well-known power generation divisions or groups that are leading the charge forward on serving the data center markets. That's where the constraints lie.\n\nFor them, both CAT and Cummins have announced expansion plans for capacity in those diesel engine, in the diesel engine production capacity that will come online in the next several years. That's somewhat unique for them because normally those markets, the primary markets of rail, marine, and mining can be cyclical, right? In the past, I think the reticence to add capacity in those large board diesel engines for manufacturing capacity, it's expensive. It's a capital-intensive, expensive to add capacity. So typically, they've kind of, I think held the line on doing that and just waited for markets to roll over in terms of cycles. This time, I think they all view it differently, which is actually a very bullish sign.\n\nI think overall that there's a belief that this part of the market is going to run for a lot longer and is going to be relevant in a big way going forward and is worthy of making that next level of capacity investment. That said, our supply chain, Generac's, we've worked very hard over the last few years to put a deal together with a supplier there that is not new to the market, but maybe new to the U.S. market. So we've been working with that partner to get those products qualified for U.S. certification. They were qualified last year for use in Europe. That's why our European team is maybe a quarter or two ahead of where we're at here in the U.S. The products are now qualified for duty here in the U.S.\n\nmarket. It is a world-class manufacturer, and they have a tremendous amount of capacity, and they have a very large appetite for additional investment. We feel that we are paired there with a very competent supplier and one that is going to give us a lot of room to run in terms of, with this initial foray into the market. One of the major reasons why we have been successful is we have been able to quote considerably shorter lead times than where the market is at, maybe half the lead time of the market today. That is great, but that is not what you build a business on.\n\nWe have got to build a business on a reputation that is staked by our performance as well, performance of the equipment itself, but also the uptime of the equipment and our ability to serve and support those customers in the way that we think we know how, given our long history in serving some areas like telecommunications as an example on a direct basis. We think our supply chain is in really good shape there, Joe. We think we have got the right partner. Again, I think we are poised for some significant growth.\n\nI would now like to turn the conference back to Kris Rosemann for closing remarks.\n\nWe want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2025 earnings results with you in late October. Thank you again and goodbye.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Rosemann. You may begin.\n\nKris Rosemann\n\nSenior Manager - Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. .\nWe will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements.

Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results highlight our ability to rapidly increase production and execute on the strong demand for home standby and portable generators, resulting from the elevated power outage environment in the second half of 2024.\nThe significant increase in demand for residential products led to fourth quarter records for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, while free cash flow generation during the quarter was an all-time quarterly record. Additionally, gross margins were very strong again during the quarter and drove adjusted EBITDA ahead of our prior expectations.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales increased 16% to $1.23 billion for the quarter. Residential product sales grew 28% from the prior year, driven by strong growth in shipments of home standby and portable generators as well as an increase in shipments of residential energy technology products.\nC&I product sales, while still strong, were approximately flat from the prior year as increases in domestic industrial distributors and telecom channels were offset by weakness in other C&I end markets. Favorable sales mix and lower input costs drove continued significant gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter helping further accelerate adjusted EBITDA margins to 21.5%.\nOur full year 2025 guidance anticipates continued net sales growth primarily driven by higher shipments of residential products. We project further gross margin improvement during the year on top of the very strong 2024 performance and expect to maintain strong adjusted EBITDA margins as compared to the prior year. Our current outlook does not contemplate the effect of any new tariff-related actions as we're currently evaluating the potential impacts, but we expect that will offset any newly imposed tariffs through the combination of cost reductions and higher pricing.\nBefore discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some full year 2024 highlights. Consolidated net sales returned to growth in the year as strength in domestic residential product sales more than offset weakness in certain C&I and international end markets. The sales mix shift to higher-margin residential products and realization of favorable input costs helped drive full year gross margins to the highest level since 2010.\nThe nearly 500 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin to 38.8% supported a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year. Robust earnings growth and focused execution on a reduction in working capital contributed to an all-time high for free cash flow generation of $605 million, easily surpassing the previous record of $427 million that was set in 2020. 2024 also provided significant evidence of the mega trends that support our enterprise strategy and long-term growth expectations.\nIt was the most active year for power outages since we began tracking this data in 2010 with nearly 1.5 billion hours lost outages in the U.S., largely driven by 3 major landed hurricanes in the second half of the year. Severe and volatile weather patterns have become increasingly common, placing even greater stress on our aging power grid. The recent wildfires in California and associated public safety power shutoffs provide yet another example of the challenges grid operators will continue to face well into the future as more intense weather-related events are projected to further compromise the reliability of the power grid.\nWe also saw grid operators and utilities aggressively raise their future expectations of power demand during the year. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence and the resulting data center build-out is projected to drive significant incremental demand on top of the established trends of electrification and reindustrialization in North America.\nAt the same time, our nation's power supplies are transitioning to lower carbon sources, which are more intermittent in their operation thereby creating additional pressure on reliability as demand rapidly accelerates. This growing supply-demand imbalance is threatening our power quality with some areas of the country coming dangerously close to having insufficient power particularly during periods of intense hot or cold temperatures when demand is at its peak.\nThe North American Electricity Reliability Corporation recently warned that significant portions of the U.S. and Canada are at risk of power outages due to supply shortfalls over the next 5 years. These trends are also impacting the forecasted cost of electricity for end users with prices anticipated to grow well beyond the 30% cumulative increase in average U.S. electricity prices that we've already experienced since 2020.\nMassive investments are needed in new generating sources, including additional transmission and distribution infrastructure to support the growing demand for power, and these costs will be passed along to rate payers in the form of higher electricity prices. These rising power costs and the increasing risk of outages support our expectations for continued growth in energy management technologies as we believe homeowners and businesses will begin to invest more aggressively in solutions to help them reduce their electric bills and improve resiliency.\nAs concerns grow about power quality and power costs, our powering a smarter world strategy is purposeful in the focus that it gives us as we develop energy ecosystems to help customers in the residential and C&I markets solve for these challenges. These ecosystems deploy a mix of assets and the software needed to optimize solar self generation, battery storage, diesel and natural gas power generators and load management devices with a focus on giving homeowners businesses and institutions much greater control over the cost and availability of their power.\nOver the last several years, Generac has made a number of strategic acquisitions as well as significant investments organically in developing these energy ecosystems that we believe have dramatically expanded the total addressable market for the company and positions us well for future growth as the megatrends around lower power quality and higher power prices continue to intensify.\nSpecifically for the home standby generator category, A significant penetration opportunity remains with only 6.5% of the addressable market of owner-occupied single-family unattached homes greater than $175,000 in value in the U.S. having a home standby generator installed at the end of the year.\nFurthermore, every 1% of incremental penetration is worth approximately $4 billion in retail market value. And with a market share above 70%, we believe Generac is incredibly well positioned to continue to lead this important product category. Now discussing our results in more detail. Fourth quarter home standby shipments increased at a mid-20% rate from the prior year, following the elevated outage activity in the second half of the year.\nHome consultations during the quarter increased at a dramatic rate and reached record levels for our fourth quarter. Building on the category awareness created by the major outage events in 2024, we remain focused on increasing and optimizing our marketing investments to grow and diversify our sales funnel while delivering high-quality leads to our dealer network.\nAs expected, close rates continued to moderate during the fourth quarter, given the record-setting levels of home consultations we experienced in the second half of 2024. Historically, the compression of close rates occurs temporarily as our dealer network absorbs the rapid increase in demand in select markets that suffered from significant outage activity.\nWe anticipate close rates will recover throughout 2025, resulting from ongoing investments in lead optimization, dealer development and expansion, consumer engagement and further penetration of financing offerings for homeowners. Our residential dealer network continued to grow in the fourth quarter and ended the year at an all-time high of approximately 9,200 dealers, an increase of 500 from the prior year and 100 dealers ahead of the prior quarter.\nThe significant growth in dealer count during 2024 not only increases overall category awareness but also provides support for a new and higher baseline level of demand for the home standby category going forward by adding more sales, installation and service capacity. We also continue to see strong momentum in our online contractor program, which targets electrical contractors that purchase our products through wholesale distribution.\nWe believe this highly aligned network of dealers and contractors is an important competitive advantage for Generac. And we continue to invest heavily to provide these partners with the best tools and capabilities to drive additional sales, installation and service bandwidth.\nActivations or installations of home standby generators were nearly flat in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. Strength in the South and West was offset by other regions that saw less significant power outage activity in the quarter. Additionally, the later timing of Hurricane Helen and Milton and longer dealer project lead times in the impacted regions have led to stronger growth in activations thus far in the first quarter of 2025 with January marking a record high for the first month of the year.\nWe continue to focus on innovation and leadership in the home standby generator category, and we recently introduced our newest lineup of home standby generators at our annual customer conference in Nashville last month. The next-generation product is our most comprehensive platform update in more than a decade and represents the most advanced home standby generator in the market, providing homeowners with unparalleled peace of mind.\nWith this new product line, we introduced the industry's largest air cooled generator, producing 28 kilowatts of output, providing homeowners that have higher power needs from electrical vehicle charging, heat pumps and other large electric loads, the lowest total cost solution for backup power.\nOur next-generation product line further secures our position in this very important market segment with the broadest, most powerful, most cost-effective home standby generators in the industry. We believe that both our end customers and installer partners will appreciate the significant value-added and innovative features of these new products, which are expected to begin shipping in the second half of 2025.\nWith this next-generation platform, we are introducing automotive technologies like fuel injection and spark ignition to the market, allowing for better fuel efficiency and lower emissions. We have also developed a new advanced controller with integrated cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity protocols as standard features, providing significant upgrades to connection quality, together with advanced remote diagnostics supporting the lowest total cost of ownership on the market.\nThese numerous benefits for our partners in the field are expected to improve efficiency and quality control in the installation and service processes, including a simplified and automated commissioning process, streamlined wiring designs and an enclosure designed with technicians in mind. In addition to our continued track record of innovation in the home standby generator market, we have also made significant investments over the last several years in our manufacturing capacity for these products. The addition of the Trenton, South Carolina facility as well as increased automation around engine and alternative production has dramatically increased our ability to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly during periods when demand surges.\nAs a result of these investments, we were able to aggressively ramp our home standby production output to meet the increased demand following the active outage environment in the second half of 2024. Given our ability to rapidly ramp production, home standby generator lead times did not increase significantly and were at normalized levels as we entered 2025.\nFor the full year 2025, we expect home standby sales to increase for the full year due to a combination of the new and higher baseline of awareness for the category, new product introductions and our initiatives to drive close rate improvements, dealer activity and marketing optimization.\nLonger term, given our competitive advantages and the significant penetration opportunity, we believe that Generac is uniquely positioned to deliver on the mega trends that support long-term growth for backup power. In addition to strong home standby shipments during the fourth quarter, sales of portable generators more than doubled from the prior year as demand for these products is more sensitive to power outages in a given period.\nOur team continues to drive increased shelf space with our key retail partners for portable generators. And while we expect these recent wins to support greater baseline demand for these products moving forward, the second half of 2025 will still face a challenging comparison to the prior year as our guidance does not assume any major outage events during the year.\nAs expected, sales of our residential energy technology products during the fourth quarter increased at a significant year-over-year rate with growth coming from ecobee and energy storage systems in the period. The ecobee team delivered exceptional results during the fourth quarter achieving record sales and positive profitability.\nIn October, we introduced the smart thermostat light, specifically targeting the professional contractor channel. And later, the smart thermostat essential -- 2 key additions to our lineup of energy monitoring and management devices that allow us to tap into the rapidly growing value segment of the smart thermostat market. We expect these new products to further support recent market share gains and continue to drive ecobee's installed base of connected homes which has grown to an impressive 4.25 million households as of the end of 2024.\nOur fourth quarter shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems benefited from the initial ramp of the Department of Energy program in Puerto Rico, increasing at a very significant rate from the prior year. While the policy backdrop for the clean energy market is uncertain, we view the long-term fundamentals as intact given the mega trends of lower power quality and rising power prices, which we believe will only further incentivize homeowners to generate, store and manage electricity on site.\nImportantly, our recent new product announcements with PWRcell 2, PWRcell 2 MAX and our next-generation home standby generators are evidence of significant progress towards building out our residential energy ecosystem. PWRcell's market-leading single cabinet storage capacity, together with our industry-leading home standby generator line, gives Generac the unique capability to offer a bottomless battery at a lower cost relative to a storage-only system that attempts to achieve a similar level of resilience by using multiple high-cost battery cabinets. This resilience, coupled with ecobee's intelligent energy management capabilities and intuitive user interface results in a differentiated solution that can make home energy more resilient, efficient and cost effective.\nFor the full year 2025, we anticipate strong double-digit sales growth for our Residential Energy Technology Solutions resulting in net sales of approximately $300 million to $400 million for the year. This growth is expected to be driven by accelerated deployments of our PWRcell energy storage systems in Puerto Rico, the new PWRcell 2 product launch expected late in the first half of 2025 as well as continued strength in ecobee sales.\nAdditionally, we anticipate ecobee will achieve a major milestone in our journey to build a differentiated residential energy ecosystem by delivering positive profitability for the full year.\nI would now like to provide some commentary on our commercial and industrial products. Global C&I product sales increased slightly on a year-over-year basis as growth domestically was driven by strong execution in our manufacturing facilities which was somewhat offset by softer international end market conditions. Domestic C&I product sales increased modestly during the fourth quarter as strong growth in shipments to our industrial distributors and telecom customers was partially offset by expected weakness in the rental and beyond standby end markets.\nShipments to our North American industrial distributor channel grew again at a robust rate in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce lead times and invest in strengthening our distribution capabilities. Given our increased manufacturing throughput and extended end customer project lead times, growth in shipments outpaced the increase in orders from this channel during the year.\nAs a result, we entered 2025 with a lower backlog as compared to the prior year, presenting a headwind to growth for the industrial distributor channel. Sales to the national -- our national telecom customers also increased at a strong rate on both a year-over-year and sequential basis during the fourth quarter. We expect to deliver strong year-over-year growth throughout 2025, and as we believe this signals the start of the next growth cycle in this end market, given the long-term secular trend of increasing global tower and network hub counts that require backup power.\nAs expected, shipments to our national and independent rental equipment customers in the fourth quarter continued to decline from the prior year as these accounts pulled back on capital spending in our categories during the year. Given our current visibility, these trends are expected to continue throughout 2025, although moderating relative to 2024.\nHowever, we continue to believe that this end market has further runway for growth as the cycle recovers, given the critical need for future infrastructure-related projects that leverage our products sold into the rental equipment channel. End market activity for our C&I generators used and beyond standby applications also remained softer during the fourth quarter as elevated interest rates continued to slow project activity in this segment of the market.\nHowever, we continue to see strong pipeline activity for our C&I battery energy storage systems or BESS, and other solutions used in multi-asset microgrids. We believe we are well positioned to lead the C&I microgrid market given our strength in natural gas generators, distribution and investments in technologies and expertise. In 2024, we completed 2 small but strategic acquisitions, adding C&I Best and microgrid controller capabilities and positioning our teams to help end customers solve for the challenges of lower power quality and higher power prices.\nImportantly, as our C&I energy ecosystem matures, we believe that our efforts to produce turnkey solutions for multi-asset microgrid projects will help to reduce the cost and complexity challenges that have hindered adoption to this point. In addition to our latest development efforts around C&I best products and microgrids, at our annual customer conference, we recently introduced a larger diesel generator product lineup with single genset power output up to 3.25 megawatts certified for the U.S. market.\nThese products are specifically designed for large load mission-critical backup power applications, including data centers. We believe that the mega trend of accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence and the associated build-out of data centers, presents a significant long-term opportunity for Generac, both directly through these new products and indirectly via increased power demand, leading to overall grid instability issues.\nInitial quoting of these larger diesel generators are expected to begin in the second quarter with the first shipments anticipated to occur later in the year, resulting in a minimal contribution to 2025 sales from this new initiative. Internationally, core total sales, which excludes the negative impact of foreign currency, increased modestly during the fourth quarter from the prior year as strength in Latin America was offset by continued softness in Europe.\nImportantly, however, international order activity regained momentum and outpaced shipments during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment expanded during the quarter due to favorable sales mix and lower input costs. For full year 2025, we expect mixed end market and regional performance to continue in our International segment. Our C&I best, microgrid and data center initiatives for domestic markets also extend international markets as part of our focused international growth strategy.\nWe continue to focus on bringing new solutions to the market to improve our positioning in established markets while also driving an expanded presence and increased penetration in certain new regions that align with the megatrends supporting our enterprise strategy.\nIn closing this morning, our record fourth quarter results reflect our significant leadership in the residential backup power market and unmatched ability to respond to the elevated demand created by power outage activity in the second half of the year. Our recent new product announcements underscore the commitment to innovation and engineering capabilities that have been at our core since we began pioneering backup power markets more than 65 years ago, and we will continue to invest in the capabilities and solutions that we believe are necessary for the future.\nAs previously discussed, the mega trends that support our future growth expectations have never been more evident and we remain confident in our powering and Smarter World enterprise strategy.\nI'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results as well as our outlook for 2025. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter 2024 results in more detail. Total net sales during the quarter increased 16% to a fourth quarter record $1.23 billion as compared to $1.06 billion in the prior year fourth quarter. The net effect of acquisitions in foreign currency had a slight favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 28% to a fourth quarter record $743 million as compared to $580 million in the prior year. As discussed, growth in residential product sales was driven by a strong increase in shipments of home standby and portable generators on the back of an active power outage season.\nIn addition, growth in shipments of both power cell energy storage systems and ecobee products also contributed to the strong year-over-year growth. Commercial and industrial product sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 were approximately flat from the prior year but still strong at $363 million.\nThe combination of contributions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency had a slight favorable impact on sales growth during the quarter. This core sales performance was a result of strong growth in shipments of domestic industrial distributors and telecom customers being offset by a decrease in sales to national rental equipment accounts and other direct customers for beyond standby applications, as well as a modest decline in international C&I product sales.\nNet sales for other products and services increased approximately 6% to $128 million as compared to $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Core sales growth of 4% was primarily due to growth in aftermarket service parts, connectivity subscription sales, ecobee services and other international services revenue.\nGross profit margin was 40.6% compared to 36.5% in the prior year fourth quarter as a result of favorable sales mix, the realization of lower input costs and production efficiencies. Operating expenses increased $66 million or 28% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by increased employee costs to support future growth across the business, additional marketing spend to drive incremental awareness for our products, and increased incentive compensation and variable expenses on the higher shipment volumes and profitability compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was a fourth quarter record $265 million or 21.5% of net sales in the current year quarter as compared to $213 million or 20% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2024, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $789 million or 18.4% of net sales as compared to $638 million or 15.9% of sales in the prior year.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales increased 20% and to $1.07 billion in the quarter as compared to $891 million in the prior year, including approximately 1% sales growth contribution from acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment was an all-time record $243 million representing 22.7% of total sales as compared to $192 million in the prior year or 21.6%. For the full year 2024, domestic segment total sales increased 9% over the prior year to $3.64 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 19.1% compared to 15.8% in the prior year.\nInternational segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 1% to $187 million in the quarter as compared to $190 million in the prior year quarter, including an approximate 2% sales growth headwind from foreign currency, resulting in an approximately 1% core total sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $22.5 million or 12% of total sales as compared to $20.4 million or 10.7% in the prior year.\nFor the full year 2024, International segment total sales decreased 13% compared to the prior year to $725 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests were 13.2% of total sales during 2024 as compared to 13.7% in the prior year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2024 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $117 million as compared to $97 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The current year net income includes a change in fair value adjustment of approximately $35 million related to our investment in Wallbox, warrants and equity securities.\nGAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $27.3 million or an effective tax rate of 18.9% as compared to $30 million or an effective tax rate of 23.7% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by the positive impact from earnings mix with higher earnings in lower tax jurisdictions as well as certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year, which did not repeat in the current year.\nDiluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.15 in the fourth quarter of '24 compared to $1.50 in the prior year. The strong year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings per share relative to growth in net income was primarily driven by a favorable $11.6 million redemption value adjustment that was reflected in the current year period EPS calculation as well as a lower share count as compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $168 million in the current year quarter or $2.80 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $126 million in the prior year or $2.07 per share. Cash flow from operations was $339 million as compared to $317 million in the prior year fourth quarter.\nAnd free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time quarterly record of $286 million as compared to $266 million in the same quarter last year. This strong free cash flow performance was driven by the record fourth quarter operating earnings, together with a $170 million source of cash due to working capital reduction during the current year quarter.\nTotal debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.33 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 1.7x on an as-reported basis, which is within our target gross debt leverage range of 1 to 2x adjusted EBITDA.\nFor the full year 2024, cash flow from operations was an all-time record $741 million as compared to $522 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was also an all-time high, $605 million as compared to $396 million in 2023. This record free cash flow performance was aided by an over $200 million source of cash from working capital reduction during the year.\nCapital expenditures during the full year totaled $137 million as we prioritize organic investments for additional production capacity and other capabilities to support future growth. We also strategically deployed approximately $35 million of capital in 2024 for acquisitions, to accelerate our Powering the Smarter World enterprise strategy and bolster our technology and distribution capabilities for our C&I products.\nAdditionally, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 1.05 million shares of our common stock during the full year for $153 million. And there is a $347 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of 2024. We also repaid approximately $278 million of debt and extended the maturity of our Term Loan B credit facility during the year.\nMoving forward, we will continue to operate within our disciplined and balanced capital allocation framework as we evaluate future shareholder value-enhancing opportunities.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2025. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are initiating 2025 net sales guidance that anticipates continued solid year-over-year growth for the full year period. We expect consolidated net sales for the full year to increase between 3% to 7% as compared to the prior year which includes a slight unfavorable impact from the net combination of foreign currency and acquisitions.\nImportantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a major related hurricane or major winter storm.\nBreaking this down by product class, we expect overall residential net sales to increase at a mid- to high single-digit rate from the prior year. We expect this growth to be led by shipments of home standby generators as the elevated power outage activity in 2024 results in a new and higher baseline level of demand for the category.\nIn addition, we expect strong year-over-year growth for our residential energy technology products as we execute on previously announced project wins in Puerto Rico, and launch new products into the market. This growth is expected to be partially offset by lower portable generator shipments in 2025, given the assumption of no major outage events included in our guidance.\nAs Aaron discussed in detail, we anticipate mixed performance across our C&I end markets, both domestically and internationally in 2025. We expect growth from telecom, C&I BESS and data center opportunities to be mostly offset by declines in rental beyond standby and domestic industrial distributor shipments. In addition, we expect the effect of foreign currency to have a modestly unfavorable impact on year-over-year growth for C&I products.\nConsidering these factors, overall global C&I product sales are expected to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis during the year. From a seasonality perspective, given lead times and backlog for our home standby products have normalized coming into 2025, we expect 2025 consolidated net sales to follow normal historical seasonality resulting in overall net sales in the first half being between 45% to 45% -- 44% to 45% weighted and sales in the second half being 55% to 56% weighted.\nSpecifically for the first quarter, we expect overall net sales to increase at a low single-digit rate from the prior year, with strong growth for residential product sales, partially offset by a high single-digit decline in C&I product sales.\nLooking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2025, we expect the full year impact of lower input costs will drive continued year-over-year margin improvement, resulting in an approximately 100 basis point increase for the full year as compared to 2024, approaching 40%. Importantly, the recently announced tariff actions are not directly reflected in this guidance. As we continue to evaluate the potential impact from these tariffs, we expect that any increase will be offset by a combination of cost reductions and price increases resulting in an EBITDA margin percent neutral impact for the year.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, we expect gross margins to increase throughout the year from approximately 38% to 39% in the first half of 2025 to approximately 40% to 41% in the second half of 2025, primarily as a result of favorable sales mix and improving input costs. Looking at our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations for the full year 2025.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are expected to be approximately 18% to 19% for the full year 2025 compared to 18.4% in 2024 as the full year impact of rising operating expenses will offset the aforementioned gross margin improvement. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to follow normal seasonality and improved significantly as we move throughout the year.\nSpecifically, regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately flat compared to the prior year at approximately 14% and then improved sequentially throughout the year, reaching approximately 21% in the fourth quarter. Significant operating expense leverage on the seasonally higher sales volumes together with the previously mentioned favorable sales mix and cost improvement are the main drivers of this EBITDA margin sequential improvement throughout the year, which is expected to result in a second half adjusted EBITDA margins to be more than 500 basis points higher than first half margins.\nAs is our normal practice, we are also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2025. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate.\nFor 2025, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% to 24.5% as compared to the 22.6% full year GAAP rate for 2024. We expect interest expense to be approximately $74 million to $78 million for the full year '25, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year. This is a significant decline from 2024 levels due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings coming into 2025 and the full year impact of lower sulfur interest rates.\nOur capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year in line with historical levels as we continue to invest in incremental capacity and execute other projects to support future growth expectations. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $83 million to $87 million in 2025 given our assumed CapEx guidance.\nGAAP intangible amortization expense in '25 is expected to be approximately $92 million to $96 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $53 million to $57 million for the year. In line with normal seasonality, operating and free cash flow generation is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year in '25 and as we expect to replenish home standby and portable finished good inventory levels during the first half of 2025.\nAs a result, for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income to be between 80% to 90%. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to increase modestly to approximately 60.5 million shares as compared to 60.3 million shares in 2024. And finally, this 2025 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value during the year.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our second quarter results were ahead of previous expectations for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, driven by lower input costs and operating expenses relative to our prior forecast. We are raising our 2024 full year outlook this morning as a result of the recent increase in power outage activity, including the impact of Hurricane Beryl. Year-over-year, overall net sales in the second quarter were nearly flat compared to the prior year at $998 million. Residential product sales increased 8% from the prior year due to strong growth in home standby generator shipments.\nGlobal C&I product sales decreased 10% from a strong prior year second quarter as softness in the telecom and rental markets was partially offset by an increase in shipments to our industrial distributor customers. Additionally, gross and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded significantly from the second quarter of 2023 as a result of favorable sales mix and the realization of lower input costs. Home standby shipments were in line with our prior expectations during the quarter, increasing at a mid-teens rate from the softer prior year period that included a meaningful headwind from excess field inventory levels.\nPower outage activity during the second quarter was above the long-term baseline average. Primarily due to strong storms in May that impacted multiple markets in Texas. Early in the third quarter, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in the Houston area driving year-to-date power outage activity well above the long-term baseline average and increasing demand for home standby and portable generators. After a slow start to the year, home consultations in the second quarter increased modestly over the prior year and grew at a strong rate on a sequential basis.\nMore importantly, home consultation activity increased significantly during the month of July due to Hurricane Beryl. Additionally, close rates have improved during the first half of 2024, as we continue to execute initiatives to improve sales lead conversion including data-driven lead optimization practices, sales tool enhancements and improved lead nurturing practices. Although we expect close rates to improve over time, they have historically moderated immediately following a major outage event in the affected region. We remain focused on making further investments to bring new and broader demographic categories into the home standby generator market and increase engagement with our end customers, particularly in regions that have not experienced material outage activity in recent periods.\nWe ended the second quarter with our residential dealer count at approximately 8,900, an increase of 200 dealers from the end of 2023. We also continue to strengthen our relationships with non-dealer contractors as we further grew our aligned contractor program, an effort that helps us expand our installation bandwidth while allowing contractors to purchase product through their preferred channel. We view our dealer and align contractor networks as an important competitive advantage for our business and we continue to invest heavily in these relationships with a focus on further developing tools and resources to optimize the selling, service and installation capabilities of our distribution partners.\nActivations or installations of home standby generators were down modestly during the first half of 2024, reflecting the lower power outage environment from late 2023 through the first quarter of 2024. However, activations have returned to strong year-over-year growth in the month of July, and we expect continued growth in installations as we move through the seasonally stronger second half and impacted by the recent increase in outage activity. As the clear leader in residential backup power, we are uniquely positioned to respond to major outage events such as Hurricane Beryl. Our ability to leverage our strong financial position to invest in inventory for storm response, combined with our logistics capabilities allow us to rapidly deploy product into outage impacted areas.\nOur industry-leading distribution network and our scalable call centers provide 24/7 consumer support and service in our customers' time of need. We are also increasing our advertising spend in the aftermath of the storm to leverage our expertise in marketing to drive awareness for our products and generate sales leads for our distribution partners, not only in the impacted region, but also more broadly across the nation. Simultaneously, we are ramping up our efforts to increase sales and installation bandwidth by adding more dealers and aligned contractors to our distribution network.\nFinally, we are increasing our production rates for home standby generators to respond to increases in demand for these products as we have built our supply chain and operating footprint capacities to allow for the rapid expansion of output to respond quickly to market changes. As a result, we are raising our overall 2024 outlook due to anticipated higher demand for home standby and portable generators following the recent increase in power outage activity. The effect of Hurricane Beryl is also expected to drive higher levels of awareness for backup power longer term as home and business owners seek protection from future power outages.\nWith only approximately 6% penetration of the addressable market of homes in the U.S., we believe there are significant opportunities to further grow the residential standby generator market. Now moving to our Residential Energy Technology Products & Solutions. The overall market for residential solar and storage continues to be negatively impacted from structural changes to California's net metering program as well as higher borrowing costs, which will continue to weigh on 2024s results for these products. Although market conditions are challenging in the near term, we recently announced the execution of the previously awarded grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to provide energy storage systems to Puerto Rico with funding from the Puerto Rico Energy Resiliency Fund.\nThe grant provides for up to $200 million in project funding over a 5-year term, which is an increase from the $100 million initially awarded when we announced our participation in the program in the fourth quarter of last year. The first shipments of energy storage systems for this program are expected to begin later this year with the bulk of program installations occurring in 2025 and 2026. Ecobee continues to execute well. gaining market share and driving robust margin improvement over the prior year. Ecobee's connected homes count is now approaching $4 million, and services attach rates continue to increase with strong growth in both Energy Services and home monitoring services. Importantly, we are leveraging Ecobee's expertise in developing hardware and software experiences that are intelligent and intuitive as their development teams are leading our efforts around building the common platform that will serve as the heart of the Generac residential energy ecosystem.\nAs disclosed in our press release this morning, we also agreed to make an incremental $35 million minority investment in Wallbox, allowing for the expansion of our commercial agreement globally to include both residential and commercial EV charging solutions, across our distribution networks. Additionally, we have aligned on a software development approach that will deepen the integration of Wallbox EV chargers with our dealer and customer platforms. We believe that the ability to manage EV charging as part of our residential and C&I energy technology ecosystems will become increasingly important as growing electric vehicle penetration and the resulting increased demand for electricity have a rising impact on home and business owners as well as grid operators around the world.\nAs we continue to build out our energy technology solutions, we believe that the combination of our internal initiatives, strategic investments and core competencies will allow us to effectively compete in these large and growing markets. As we bring increasingly competitive solutions to market over the coming quarters, starting with our next-generation energy storage system later this year, we will accelerate our efforts in expanding and engaging our distribution network. This will allow us to gain market share by further leveraging our expertise in providing superior channel and customer support as well as our proficiency and deliver qualified sales leads to distribution partners and our brand strength. We believe our unique and comprehensive approach to residential energy management will provide further differentiation as we develop the smart energy home of the future.\nSwitching now to our C&I product category. As previously expected, global C&I product sales declined 10% from the prior year, driven by a decrease in shipments to both domestic telecom and rental customers. This decline was partially offset by continued growth with our North American industrial distributors as shipments to this channel, again grew at a robust rate in the second quarter and quoting activity remained resilient. We continue to expand our market share, primarily due to our ongoing focus on operational execution, leading to reduced product lead times and further optimization of our domestic distributor channel.\nThis includes additional investment in certain territories where we believe we have a potential to improve our share regionally through M&A or further development of our independent distribution partners. As expected, shipments to national telecom and rental equipment customers declined in the quarter from the strong prior year period, and we continue to believe these end markets will remain soft for the balance of the year. However, we see long-term growth opportunities in both markets despite the near-term cyclical weakness. We believe the critical need for future infrastructure projects provide substantial runway for growth in the rental channel.\nIn the market for backup power for telecom applications, our long-term growth expectations are supported by the secular trend of growing global tower and network hub counts and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications and services that require significantly greater power reliability. As previously announced in late June, we acquired the C&I battery energy storage system product offering from Sun Grid solutions located in Cambridge, Canada. This small but strategic acquisition brings us engineering and manufacturing expertise to better serve the growing market for behind-the-meter energy storage solutions for commercial and industrial applications including where it is deployed as a critical component in multi-asset microgrids.\nWe have an expanding pipeline of commercial projects in which we expect to provide stationary battery storage alongside our traditional generator product offerings. And additionally, we're seeing a number of projects in which EV charging equipment is also included. We believe our commercial agreement with Wallbox is important to helping expand our opportunity to win these and other similar projects. As we leverage our leading position in natural gas generators and our newly acquired capabilities in energy storage with the [ SunGuard ] acquisition, we believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions for the developing microgrid market, which is focused on providing C&I customers with important energy resiliency as well as lower overall energy costs.\nInternationally, Total sales were lower year-over-year primarily related to declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the telecom market in the U.S. as well as lower shipments in Europe, most notably for portable generators. Increases in shipments to other key regions such as Latin America and India partially offset this softness. As previously discussed, our expanded agreement with Wallbox also includes incremental collaboration in international end markets. This is another example of our longer-term international growth strategy as we bring a broad portfolio of solutions to more markets around the world, building on the strong track record of growth and margin expansion in our international segment over the past several years.\nIn closing this morning, our second quarter margin outperformance and increased 2024 outlook highlight the fundamental momentum occurring within our business, significant year-over-year margin expansion and robust free cash flow generation in the first half of 2024, and have supported our continued investments in accelerating our powering of Smarter World enterprise strategy while also enhancing shareholder value through continued share repurchases. Once again, Hurricane Beryl highlighted the vulnerability of the electrical grid and the need for resiliency. Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane to form in the Atlantic on record, providing further evidence that the changing weather patterns continue to threaten the continuity of power that we are increasingly dependent on.\nAdditionally, the rapid adoption of intermittent generation sources and growing demand from electrification trends as well as the adoption of artificial intelligence are providing additional stresses on our nation's aging power grid. These secular trends will continue to manifest in lower power quality and higher power prices for all rate payers in the decades to come. By expanding on Generac's core resiliency value proposition and helping optimize for efficiency, consumption, cost and comfort, we remain confident that our products and solutions are uniquely capable of helping home and business owners solve the challenges around resiliency and rising utility costs.\nI'll now turn the call over to York to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our increased outlook for 2024. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2024 results in more detail. Net sales were $998 million during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $1 billion in the prior year second quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had a slight positive impact on revenue during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 8% to $538 million as compared to $499 million in the prior year. Growth in residential product sales was primarily driven by a mid-teens increase in shipments of home standby generators and strong growth for portable generators domestically. This was partially offset by a decrease in portable generator shipments in Europe given a strong prior year comparison ongoing softness in the domestic clean energy market and lower store product sales.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 10% to $344 million as compared to $384 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency and acquisitions contributed approximately 1% growth in the quarter. The core sales decline was primarily due to the expected weakness in sales to our domestic telecom and national equipment rental customers. This was partially offset by a robust increase in C&I product shipments through our domestic industrial distributor channel and growth in certain other key international markets. Net sales for other products and services decreased slightly to $116 million as compared to $117 million in the prior year quarter.\nGross profit margin was 37.6% compared to 32.8% in the prior year second quarter, primarily due to favorable sales mix, given stronger home standby shipments and the realization of lower input costs, including lower freight and steel costs as well as improved production efficiencies. Second quarter gross margins exceeded our expectations as we were able to deliver the implied gross margin ramp in the second half of the year sooner than expected given improving input costs. Operating expenses increased $30 million or 12% as compared to the second quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to ongoing investment in resources to drive future growth across the business, including salaries, benefits, stock compensation and bonus and our marketing and emotional spend to create incremental awareness for our products.\nAs a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $165 million or 16.5% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to $137 million or 13.6% of net sales in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in ahead of our expectations during the quarter as a result of the gross margin outperformance as well as lower operating expenses compared to prior forecast. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales including intersegment sales, increased 1% to $827 million in the quarter as compared to $815 million in the prior year quarter, as strong growth in the residential product category was mostly offset by expected weakness in C&I product shipments. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $140 million, representing a 16.9% margin as compared to $103 million in the prior year or 12.7% of total sales.\nThis margin improvement was primarily driven by favorable sales mix and the realization of lower input costs, partially offset by higher operating expense investments to support future growth initiatives. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales decreased 18% to $185 million in the quarter as compared to $224 million in the prior year quarter. The approximate 18% core total sales decline for the segment was primarily driven by a decrease in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the domestic telecom market as well as lower shipments in most European markets, most notably for portable generators.\nThis softness was partially offset by increased sales in other key regions such as Latin America and India. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $25 million or 13.6% of total sales as compared to $33 million or 14.9% of total sales in the prior year. This margin decline was primarily due to reduced operating leverage on lower shipments during the quarter. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2024 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $59 million as compared to $45 million for the second quarter of 2023.\nGAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter were $20 million, or an effective tax rate of 25% as compared to $16 million or an effective tax rate of 25.9% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year period, which did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.97 in the second quarter of '24 compared to $0.70 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $82 million in the current year quarter or $1.35 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $68 million in the prior year or $1.08 per share.\nCash flow from operations in the current year second quarter was $78 million, as compared to $83 million in the prior year second quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $50 million as compared to $54 million in the same quarter last year. This change in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher cash income tax payments in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Additionally, during the second quarter, we repurchased 355,640 shares of our common stock for approximately $51 million. There is an approximately $449 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization as of June 30. In early July, we amended and replaced our existing $530 million Term Loan B credit facility, which was set to mature in December 2026, and with a new credit facility that has an aggregate principal amount of $500 million after we made a $30 million cash prepayment in connection with the term loan amendment.\nThis new credit facility has a maturity date of July 3, 2031. The new credit facility maintains the existing low rate of sulfur plus 175 basis points, while also eliminating a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment that was included in the previous term loan B credit facility. Quarterly principal payments equal to $1.25 million will begin in October 2024, with a lump sum due at maturity in July 2031. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.56 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2.25x on an as-reported basis, a continued reduction from 2.5x at the end of 2023.\nAs we expect to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of '24, we will continue to execute a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are increasing our overall outlook for full year 2024. Given the elevated demand for backup power in the state of Texas due to the recent power outages, including Hurricane Beryl that made landfall in early July, we now expect overall 2024 net sales growth to be approximately 4% to 8% as compared to the prior year. This is an increase from the previously expected range of 3% to 7%. Again, as a result of the recent outage activity in Texas, we are increasing our expectations for 2024 home standby generator sales growth to be in the high teens range and portable generator sales are also now expected to be well above our prior forecast.\nPartially offsetting these strong trends in Texas, we are seeing continued softness in residential clean energy and shore markets, resulting in only a modest reduction in our outlook for those products. As a result, overall residential product sales for the full year are now expected to grow at a mid-teens rate as compared to our prior forecast for low double-digit growth. Our full year 2024 sales growth outlook for the remaining product categories is unchanged from our prior forecast. From a pacing perspective, we anticipate year-over-year net sales growth will accelerate as we move through the second half of the year, with third quarter net sales growth in the high single-digit range and fourth quarter net sales growth in the low to mid-teens range.\nThis guidance assumes power outage activity that is in line with the longer-term baseline average for the remainder of the year and does not assume the benefit of an additional major power outage event for the rest of the year. Our gross margin expectations for the full year 2024 have also increased relative to our previous guidance, given the second quarter outperformance and higher sales mix from home standby generator sales in the second half of the year. We now expect gross margins to improve by approximately 350 to 400 basis points over the full year 2023. This is an increase from the 300 to 350 basis point improvement previously expected.\nGross margins are projected to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year due to continued favorable mix, price and cost with fourth quarter gross margin improving over third quarter gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. As a result of this increased outlook for gross margins, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 17% to 18% for the full year 2024. Additionally, we also expect adjusted EBITDA margins to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year, driven by the above-mentioned gross margin improvement and additional operating leverage on higher shipments as we move throughout the second half of the year. This will result in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins improving over third quarter adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 200 basis points resulting in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20%.\nAs is our normal practice, we will also provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2024. For the full year, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25% to 26%. This is expected to result in a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for each of the remaining 2 quarters of the year. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflective net of tax using the 25% expected effective tax rate.\nGross interest expense is now expected to be approximately $92 million to $94 million as compared to the prior guidance of $90 million to $93 million. This guidance assumes no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be between $52 million to $54 million for the year as compared to prior guidance of $55 million to $60 million. We're also increasing our free cash flow conversion guidance for the full year to be well above 100% as we anticipate an incremental benefit from working capital reduction in the second half of the year. This compares to our prior guidance of approximately 100%. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to decrease to approximately 60.5 million to 61 million shares as compared to prior guidance of 61 million shares.\nThis updated guidance reflects the share repurchases that were completed in the second quarter of this year. Our guidance for capital expenditures as a percentage of sales remains consistent at approximately 3% of sales. Depreciation expense in GAAP intangible amortization expense also remained consistent with last year's -- last quarter's guidance. And finally, this 2024 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Kris Rosemann, your Manager, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Rosemann\n\nSenior Manager - Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.\nPlease see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nI will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were ahead of our prior expectations due to higher-than-expected C&I shipments, favorable input costs and strong operational execution. We are reiterating our overall 2024 outlook this morning for net sales, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow conversion, which York will discuss more in detail later in the call. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased slightly to $889 million.\nResidential product sales increased 2% as compared to the prior year quarter as strong growth in home standby generator shipments was partially offset by a decline in certain other residential product sales. Global C&I product sales decreased 2% from a strong prior year period as a robust increase in shipments to our industrial distributor customers mostly offset weakness in the domestic rental and telecom markets. Significant year-over-year margin expansion and disciplined working capital management helped drive a substantial improvement in free cash flow generation from the prior year, while we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives.\nHome standby shipments were in line with our prior expectations during the quarter, increasing at a mid-teens rate from the softer prior year period that included a meaningful headwind from excess field inventory levels. As expected, Shipments and activations were aligned exiting the first quarter, signaling that field inventory levels are reaching more normalized levels. The removal of the excess field inventory headwind is expected to support strong year-over-year growth in home standby generator sales in the coming quarters.\nPower outage activity in the U.S. during the first quarter was approximately in line with the longer-term baseline average as higher outages in January were offset by lower outage activity in the months of February and March. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, declined modestly from the prior year period, reflecting the softer outage environment over the last several quarters and resulting weaker home consultation performance, specifically in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nHome consultations did increase sequentially during the first quarter but declined on a year-over-year basis from a very strong prior year period. For historical perspective, home consultations in the first quarter were modestly higher than the first quarter of 2022 and but were more than 3.5x higher than the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we experienced moderate sequential improvement in close rates during the first quarter as we continue to execute initiatives that we believe will drive further increases beyond this year, including data-driven lead optimization practices, sales tool enhancements and improved lead nurturing practices.\nWe are also making ongoing investments in engaging with our end customers and bringing awareness of the category to new and broader demographic categories to expand the overall sales funnel for home standby generators. We ended the first quarter with our residential dealer count at approximately 8,800, a net increase of 100 dealers during the period. We have also been experiencing good traction with nondealer contractors as we have seen steady increases in the number of installers in our aligned contractor program, an effort that helps us better strengthen these relationships and improve our installation bandwidth while allowing contractors to purchase products through their preferred channel.\nWe will continue to invest in growing our network of installers including both dealers and nondealer installers as well as in the tools and teams -- as well as the tools and teams to support and optimize these distribution partners, which we view as a key competitive advantage for our business. Our teams have also continued to make incremental operational improvements within our home standby production facilities. These improvements contributed to the margin expansion that we experienced in recent quarters, and this momentum bodes well for future growth and profitability.\nWe believe we are emerging from the recent field inventory challenges with a continued focus on quality and execution as well as an improved competitive position. We will continue to leverage our unparalleled scale and strength in manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, distribution and our strong financial profile to drive growth in the home standby market in the years ahead as we grow the number of consumers engaging in the category, expand our industry-leading omnichannel distribution network, invest in customized sales processes and tools to drive close rates higher and expand the broadest product portfolio in the market.\nWhile home standby shipments were in line with our prior expectations during the first quarter, however, our overall residential product sales were lower than expected due to continued softness in global portable generator shipments as well as weaker domestic energy storage and EV markets and continued post pandemic-related challenges with the market for core products. We expect these specific softer end market conditions to impact our overall residential product category, sales growth for the full year 2024, but our expectations for home standby generator shipments are unchanged relative to our prior guidance.\nNow moving to our Residential Energy Technology Products and Solutions, our Ecobee team continued to drive year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter despite a challenging retail environment as performance with professional contractors remain strong. Ecobee's number of connected homes and services attached rate also experienced positive momentum during the quarter. Importantly, Ecobee's gross margin improved meaningfully on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and improvement in electronic component supply chains relative to the first quarter of 2023.\nWithin our residential clean energy product suite, we continue to make progress on key product development objectives. And additionally, fleet health of our installed base has materially improved after substantially completing our warranty upgrade program in 2023 and with a continued laser focus on improving the quality of these products and solutions.\nWe are also moving forward in our partnerships with the Department of Energy as we work to bring clean power generation and resiliency to Puerto Rico via our residential energy storage systems and through our participation in the grid resilience and innovation partnership program in Massachusetts, which demonstrates our ability to integrate multiple technologies to support our homes energy needs while also providing additional value for grid operators.\nFinally, we remain excited about our collaboration with Wallbox as we will begin shipments of the company's best-in-class EV charging solutions during the second quarter. We continue to expect that the investments we're making to develop residential energy technology solutions will generate attractive returns in the years to come. Our teams are focused on deep integration of the products and platforms we have acquired while tightening our focus on building high-quality solutions where we believe we can create the most value for the consumer.\nWith improved focus and execution and by leveraging our core competencies around sales and marketing, lead generation, distribution, customer support and global sourcing, we believe we can create competitive advantages that will become evident over time as we continue to develop the smart energy home of the future.\nSwitching gears, I now want to provide some commentary on our C&I products. Global C&I product sales declined 2% from the prior year, which was ahead of our prior expectations, driven by a decrease in sales to domestic telecom and rental customers, partially offset by continued growth in our North American industrial distributor channel and certain industrial or international markets.\nAs a result of the strong first quarter outperformance, our expectations for full year 2024 C&I product sales are now higher. Shipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel again grew significantly in the first quarter. Quoting activity remained resilient in the quarter, and we continue to drive market share gains within our core product lineup. In addition, our operational execution helped to reduce lead times during the quarter.\nAs expected, shipments to national telecom and rental customers declined in the quarter from the strong prior year period. Consistent with our prior expectations, we believe these end markets will remain soft in the coming quarters. However, despite the cyclical weakness in the rental channel, we continue to believe this end market has substantial runway for future growth given the critical need for future infrastructure projects that leverage our products.\nAdditionally, leveraging our 40 years of experience serving the telecom market, we are confident in our ability to capture the future growth potential around the secular trend of increasing global tower and network hub counts and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications and services that require significantly greater power reliability.\nShipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional standby projects declined moderately during the quarter, as the higher interest rate environment impacted project ROIs and time lines. Longer term, we view these applications as an important opportunity for Generac, our end customers and grid operators as reliability concerns energy prices and market volatility all trend higher. Additionally, we will continue to build a pipeline of multi-asset projects that utilize both our natural gas generators and our recently introduced C&I energy storage systems.\nWhile we are in the early innings of the growth opportunity, we intend to leverage our leading position in natural gas generators to drive market share gains in behind-the-meter energy storage in the coming years as our C&I customers seek to utilize energy storage for short duration outages variable rate arbitrage and grid service opportunities while also leveraging our traditional generator offerings for a complete resiliency solution.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to bring these solutions to market and continue to invest in the teams, technology and processes necessary to deliver comprehensive solutions for the C&I market focused on energy resilience and efficiency.\nInternationally, total sales were lower year-over-year primarily related to declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the telecom market in the U.S. as well as lower shipments in certain European markets, most notably for portable generators as energy security concerns eased relative to the first quarter of 2023. Strong growth in shipments to Latin American end markets partially offset this softness. Internationally, International adjusted EBITDA margins held at 15% and consistent with the prior year period as disciplined price cost actions were offset by lower operating leverage on decreased shipment volumes.\nIn closing this morning, we are encouraged by the ongoing improvement in operational execution reflected in our first quarter results as strong year-over-year performance in home standby generators and increased shipments of C&I products to our industrial distributor customers offset end market softness in other areas of our business. The return to our historically robust gross margin and cash flow generation profile, allows for additional capital allocation optionality and further strengthens our confidence in executing our powering a smarter world enterprise strategy.\nAdditionally, the recent acceleration in data center construction activity, driven in large part by the emergence of artificial intelligence, has further increased the growing pressure on electricity supply/demand imbalances and underscores the relevance of the mega trends that underpin our enterprise strategy. Data centers will not only directly increase industry-wide demand for backup power, but have also served to raise public awareness of the looming electrical grid supply constraints.\nAccelerating demand for artificial intelligence and the deployment of energy-intensive data centers join the growing trends of electrification and the reindustrialization of North America, which is driving power consumption forecasts meaningfully higher than previously forecasted. At the same time, grid operators continue to add intermittent power generation sources and retire baseload thermal generation while also facing extensive siting and permitting challenges as well as critical equipment shortages.\nAfter multiple decades of very little electrical -- growth in electrical demand the aging power grid in the U.S. is clearly not prepared for the future trajectory of power consumption needed to satisfy these converging trends. And this is even before considering the long-term trend of increasingly frequent severe weather events that are creating additional stress on the nation's electrical grid.\nGenerac's backup power portfolio, in particular, is well positioned to provide home and business owners with the continuity and resilience they demand in an increasingly electrified world. In addition, our next-generation energy technology solutions across both residential and C&I product categories will further expand on our resiliency value proposition by helping optimize for efficiency, consumption, comfort and cost.\nWe believe our broad offering of products and solutions are uniquely capable in helping home and business owners solve the challenges resulting from this accelerating energy transition.\nI'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2024. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2024 results in more detail. Net sales increased to $889 million during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $888 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% positive impact on revenue growth during the quarter.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 2% to $429 million as compared to $419 million in the prior year. Growth in residential product sales was primarily driven by a mid-teens increase in shipments of home standby generators. This was partially offset by a large decrease in portable generator shipments in the U.S. and Europe given a strong prior year comparison, ongoing softness in the domestic solar plus storage market and lower core product sales.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 2% to $354 million as compared to $363 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency and acquisitions contributed approximately 2% growth in the quarter. The core sales decline was due to the expected weakness in sales to our domestic telecom and national equipment rental customers. This performance was largely offset by a robust increase in C&I product shipments through our domestic industrial distributor channel, and growth in certain international markets, including Latin America.\nNet sales for other products and services increased slightly to $106 million, including approximately 1% contribution from favorable foreign currency. Gross profit margin was 35.6% compared to 30.7% in the prior year first quarter due to a favorable sales mix, given stronger home standby shipments, improved production efficiencies, lower input costs and higher pricing as compared to the prior year. First quarter gross margins exceeded our prior expectations as a result of better-than-expected input cost realization and strong operational execution.\nOperating expenses increased $21 million or 9% as compared to the first quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to ongoing investment in our teams to drive future growth. and higher marketing spend to create incremental awareness for our products. More specifically, research and development expenses grew at a rate approximately double that of our overall operating expenses, highlighting our ongoing evolution to an energy technology solutions company. Operating expenses for the quarter were in line with our prior expectations as we execute strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth.\nAs a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $127 million or 14.3% of net sales in the first quarter as compared to $100 million or 11.3% of net sales in the prior year.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased slightly to $720 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $99 million, representing a 13.8% margin as compared to $68 million in the prior year or 9.4% of total sales. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 14% to $187 million in the quarter as compared to $216 million in the prior year quarter.\nForeign currency and acquisitions contributed approximately 4% sales growth in the quarter. The approximate 18% core total sales decline for the segment was primarily driven by declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the domestic telecom market as well as lower shipments in certain European markets, most notably for portable generators. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $28 million or 15% of total sales, as compared to $32 million or 15% of total sales in the prior year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of '24 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $26 million as compared to $12 million for the first quarter of 2023. The current year period includes a $6 million noncash expense that reflects the change in the fair value of our warrants and equity securities in Wallbox, a minority investment we made in Q4 of 2023.\nGAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $12 million or an effective tax rate of 31.2% as compared to $8 million or an effective tax rate of 35.7% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher pretax book income that reduced the impact of certain discrete tax items in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.39 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.05 in the prior year. The current year period included a $2.7 million redemption value adjustment that impacted our earnings per share, while the prior year period included a $9 million redemption value adjustment.\nAdjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $53 million in the current year quarter or $0.88 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $39 million in the prior year or $0.63 per share. Cash flow from operations in the quarter and the current year first quarter was a positive $112 million as compared to negative $19 million in the prior year first quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was positive $85 million as compared to negative $42 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to higher operating earnings a reduction in primary working capital in the current year quarter and a large onetime cash tax payment in the prior year period, which did not repeat. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.56 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2.35x on an as-reported basis, a continued reduction from the 2.5x at the end of 2023.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our overall outlook for net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2024. For our top line sales outlook, we still expect overall year-over-year growth to be approximately 3% to 7%, which includes a slight favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. However, we now expect a slightly lower mix of residential products and a slightly higher mix of C&I products compared to our previous expectations.\nAs Aaron previously mentioned, we are not changing our outlook for home standby generator shipments for the full year. As field inventory for home standby generators normalizes and we start shipping in line with the end market, we continue to expect a significant year-over-year increase in home standby generator shipments. However, other residential products are facing softer end market conditions than previously anticipated. As a result of lower expectations for global portable generator shipments, continued softness in domestic energy storage and EV markets and weakness in short product sales, we now expect the full year growth rate for residential product sales to be in the low double-digit range. as compared to the mid-teens growth rate previously projected.\nOffsetting this incremental softness in residential end markets, we now anticipate C&I product sales to be higher than previously expected resulting in a mid- to high single-digit rate decrease versus prior year as compared to our prior guidance for an approximate 10% decline. This improved outlook is primarily driven by the higher-than-expected shipments to our domestic industrial distributor customers in the first quarter. Specifically for the second quarter, we expect overall net sales to be nearly flat as compared to the prior year period, with growth rates anticipated to accelerate in the second half of the year.\nImportantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the remainder of the year that is in line with the longer-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event which could add $50 million to $100 million in additional shipments during the year.\nOur gross margin expectations for the full year 2024 are now modestly higher than previous guidance given the Q1 outperformance. We now expect gross margins to improve by approximately 300 to 350 basis points over the full year 2023, an increase from the 300 basis point improvement previously expected. Gross margins are projected to increase sequentially throughout the year with second half 2024 gross margins now growing by approximately 200 basis points over the first half 2024 gross margins, given favorable mix, price and cost impacts.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are still expected to be approximately 16.5% to 17.5% for the full year. This guidance assumes that the better-than-expected gross margins previously discussed will be mostly offset by modestly higher-than-expected operating expenses to help support enterprise-wide strategic initiatives. As a result, we now expect second half adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 450 basis points higher than first half EBITDA margins, driven by the combination of gross margin expansion and operating leverage on higher sales volumes in the second half of the year. This compares to the previous expectation of nearly 600 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement from the first half to the second half of the year.\nAs is our normal practice, we will also -- we are also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2024. For the full year, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25% to 26% as compared to the 25.2% full year GAAP tax rate for 2023. This is expected to result in a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% in each of the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate.\nInterest expense is now expected to be approximately $90 million to $93 million as compared to prior guidance of approximately $85 million to $90 million due to an increase in interest rate expectations for the remainder of the year. This guidance assumes no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year.\nOur overall cash flow generation guidance remains unchanged. Operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year in 2024. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion to be strong at approximately 100% as we continue to monetize working capital build of prior years. Depreciation expense, GAAP intangible amortization expense, stock compensation expense and diluted share count expectations also remain consistent with last quarter's guidance. Finally, this 2024 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Kris Rosemann, Senior Manager, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Rosemann\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements.\nCertain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors.\nIn addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nI will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Happy Valentine's Day. I think I can say that. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued improvement in operating performance as shipments of home standby generators returned to strong year-over-year growth in the quarter despite a softer-than-expected power outage environment. We also experienced significant margin expansion in the quarter, driven by favorable mix and price cost tailwinds on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.\nIn addition, we generated record free cash flow in the quarter on the continued reduction of our inventory levels. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 1% to $1.06 billion, and core sales were approximately flat during the quarter. Residential product sales increased 1% from the prior year as growth in home standby generator shipments offset lower portable generator sales in the quarter.\nC&I product sales were approximately in line with the strong prior year fourth quarter as softness in the domestic telecom and rental channels was offset by continued strength in broader C&I end markets. Before discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some highlights for the full year 2023. Global C&I product sales in 2023 reached an all-time record of approximately $1.5 billion, our third consecutive year of strong double-digit growth in the category, resulting in a nearly 30% sales, compounded annual sales growth rate over those 3 years. This included record full year performance in our International segment for both net sales and adjusted EBITDA.\nThe strength in our C&I products has helped to offset the headwinds in our residential product categories related to elevated levels of home standby generator field inventory in 2023 and a strong comparable period that included the benefit of excess backlog reduction. Although our shipments to the market were impacted by these factors during the year, home consultations or sales leads increased for the full year despite not having the benefit of a major outage event during 2023.\nAdditionally, our return to improving margin performance in the second half of the year, together with the continued reduction in our inventory levels, helped drive cash flow from operations to an all-time record for full year 2023. This robust cash flow generation provided additional flexibility with respect to our capital deployment as we completed $252 million of share repurchases, while also continuing to invest in advancing our products and solutions road maps during the year.\nWe continue to make significant investments in our engineering and manufacturing capabilities in 2023 as we opened an engineering center of excellence in Reno, Nevada, and broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in Wisconsin to increase capacity for C&I stationary products. We also continue to launch compelling new products during the year, including the introduction of stationary C&I energy storage solutions for the domestic market to help decentralize, digitize and decarbonize the future electrical grid with advanced microgrid applications.\nIn addition, the Ecobee team launched a smart doorbell camera product line, helping to drive engagement to their platform. We also made important progress towards our vision of building a common platform and user interface for our suite of residential solutions through the integration of our home standby generators and propane tank monitoring devices using Ecobee as the central hub to manage our products and solutions.\nAdditionally, we introduced our new -- it's a power move advertising campaign to help drive incremental consumer awareness of the home standby generator category to a broader demographic range. We made further strategic investments in 2023 that help to accelerate our powering of Smarter World Enterprise Strategy as we acquired [ Raifo ] storage systems, a provider of stationary C&I energy storage solutions for European markets and made a minority investment in Wallbox, a leading provider of EV charging solutions for both residential and commercial applications.\nOur investment in Wallbox is expected to result in global commercial collaboration as well as the addition of a Generac seed on the Wallbox Board of Directors. We're excited to partner with an innovative technology leader in the EV charging industry and look forward to integrating Wallbox's solutions with our broader energy technology portfolio to further expand the value proposition of the energy ecosystem that we are building for homes and businesses.\nImportantly, throughout 2023, the megatrends that we believe will drive our longer-term growth were on full display as increasingly severe weather, coupled with the continued evolution of the energy grid in the U.S. further demonstrated the important role that our products and solutions can provide to the market. Although the U.S. did not experience any major power outage events during 2023 and despite the fourth quarter being the lowest fourth quarter for outage hours since 2015, there were numerous smaller scale severe weather events that did occur throughout the year across a number of regions in North America, which drove monthly power outage activity above the long-term average baseline.\nIn addition to the increasingly frequent and higher magnitude weather-related power disruptions, legislative and regulatory reactions to climate change are also impacting the Power Grid as well. On the supply side, utility scale, solar and wind power are being incentivized relative to traditional baseload thermal sources, but they are intermittent in nature and continue to face growing siting and permitting challenges. At the same time, demand is increasing as electrification trends are accelerating around heating, cooking and transportation and power-hungry data center and telecom infrastructure continues to rapidly build out.\nThese changes are creating significant challenges as utilities and grid operators are struggling to reliably match supply and demand, particularly during periods of extreme heat during the summer and cold during the winter. In its 2023 long-term reliability assessment, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, continued to warn of the elevated risk of resource shortfalls across the majority of the U.S. and Canada. As key forecasts around supply availability and future electricity peak demand are creating a higher risk of imbalance, leading to potential outages more so than any time in recent history.\nAs a result of these factors, we expect there will continue to be significant opportunities for our portfolio of power resiliency and energy efficiency solutions well into the future. Specifically for the home standby generator category, we believe a massive penetration opportunity still remains. As only 6.25% of the addressable market of single-family unattached homes greater than $150,000 in value in the U.S. had a home standby generator installed at the end of 2023.\nFurthermore, every 1% of incremental penetration is worth approximately $3 billion of market value. And with a market share greater than 70%, we believe Generac is incredibly well positioned to continue to lead the commercialization of this important product category. These same mega trends create significant opportunities for our global C&I products and solutions as businesses are also concerned about navigating power reliability issues and volatile energy prices. Near term, we are focused on further executing on our strategic vision, which we believe puts Generac in a unique position to help home and business owners solve for the energy-related challenges that lie ahead.\nNow discussing our results in more detail. Fourth quarter home standby shipments increased approximately 10% from the prior year despite continued field inventory destocking and a softer-than-expected power outage activity, which also weighed on home consultations during the quarter. However, in early 2024, severe winter storms pushed outage activity to record levels for the month of January. Power conservation notices sent to homeowners in select markets, driven by unseasonably cold temperatures and the related spike in power demand also contributed to consumer awareness of the vulnerability of the electrical grid.\nAs a result of these factors, home consultations in January of this year were an all-time record for the month. Our residential dealer count ended the fourth quarter at approximately 8,700 in line with the prior year count. Dealer productivity trends further improved in the quarter, and we continued to execute on our initiatives to train non-dealer contractors, helping to increase overall installation capacity. Notably, close rates improved moderately during the fourth quarter, helping to offset the impact of lower power outage activity and softer home consultations.\nMore importantly, activations, which are a proxy for installations, were at an all-time quarterly record in the fourth quarter, increasing slightly from the previous record of the fourth quarter of 2022, providing further support for our belief that the home standby category is holding a new and higher level baseline level of demand. The record activations in the fourth quarter helped to further reduce the number of home standby generators in our distribution channels as we continue to under ship end market demand in the quarter.\nAs certain regions and channels of the home standby market have returned to normal ordering patterns, the gap between shipments and activations further narrowed as we exited 2023, and we continue to expect overall shipments and activations to align later in the first quarter of this year. For 2024, we expect home standby sales to increase at a rate approximately in line with the mid-teens residential sales growth guidance disclosed in our press release this morning.\nAdditionally, we expect home standby generator sales to increase on a year-over-year basis in each quarter throughout the year, assuming that power outage activity is in line with the historical baseline average. In addition to home standby generator shipments returning to growth, Sales of our residential energy Technology Products and Solutions also increased during the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, led by continued growth at Ecobee as our team there continued to gain share in the smart thermostat market by driving momentum with professional contractors and further expanding their presence with key retail partners.\nThe fourth quarter launch of Ecobee smart doorbell camera was well received by consumers and industry experts and continued to showcase their expertise in delivering consistently positive customer experiences. Ecobee finished 2023 with more than 3.5 million connected homes, giving us a large installed base of satisfied customers that we can cross-sell our products and service capabilities to as we work towards rolling out our residential energy technology ecosystem.\nWe experienced another important event during the fourth quarter as we were awarded grants from the Department of Energy to utilize our residential energy technology solutions for resiliency focused programs in Puerto Rico and Massachusetts over the next several years. The program in Puerto Rico is expected to utilize our energy storage systems to provide clean energy independence for residents. The program in Massachusetts is expected to include our energy storage systems, Ecobee Smart Thermostats and grid services capabilities, demonstrating our ability to integrate multiple technologies to support our home's energy needs while also providing additional value for grid operators by aggregating and managing these distributed energy resources in a virtual power plant setting.\nAs previously mentioned, we made an important minority investment in Wallbox during the fourth quarter, which provides for a future seat on the Wallbox Board of Directors and creates the opportunity for global commercial collaboration across our residential and C&I distribution networks. The partnership also brings future access to industry-leading bidirectional charging development. which we believe will play an increasingly critical role in our emerging residential energy technology ecosystem as the penetration of electric vehicles increases in the future.\nFor 2024, we expect gross sales for residential energy technology products and services, including energy storage, energy management devices and services, connectivity and home EV charging solutions to be in a range of $325 million to $350 million, a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 25%. We continue to make meaningful investments in building out our residential energy ecosystem, including our next-generation energy storage system, which is expected to be commercially available later in the second half of this year.\nI would now like to provide some commentary on our commercial and industrial products. Global C&I product sales were approximately flat on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and increased 19% for the full year 2023, to approximately $1.5 billion. Domestic C&I product sales declined modestly during the fourth quarter as softness in shipments to the telecom and rental channels offset continued strength in sales to our industrial distributors and other direct customers for beyond standby applications.\nShipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel again grew at a robust rate in the fourth quarter. Although order patterns in the second half of the year were impacted by extended product time lines, quoting activity remained resilient despite being off the peak levels experienced earlier in 2023. Shipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional standby projects increased at a very strong rate during the fourth quarter.\nAs the leading provider of natural gas generators, we continue to pioneer new market opportunities for beyond standby generator applications and other energy technology solutions in C&I end markets. We are working to facilitate the development of our increasingly comprehensive products and solutions in multi-asset applications, such as pairing our smart grid ready natural gas generators with our emerging C&I storage, connectivity, advanced controls and grid services platforms.\nWhile we believe this is an important long-term growth opportunity, today's higher interest rates are putting pressure on project time lines. And as a result, we expect shipments of products for beyond standby related applications to be negatively impacted in 2024. Sales to our national and independent rental equipment customers in the fourth quarter declined from the prior year as order patterns remained weaker than the stronger prior year comparisons.\nDespite the normal cyclical softness in this vertical that is impacting our overall 2024 expectations, we continue to believe that this end market has substantial runway for growth given the critical need for future infrastructure-related projects that leverage our products sold into the rental equipment channels. As expected, shipments to national telecom customers declined again during the quarter, particularly when compared to the very strong prior year fourth quarter level as these customers further reduced capital expenditures. Given our current visibility, we expect shipments to telecom national accounts will remain soft in the coming quarters, weighing on our overall 2024 outlook.\nHowever, we have experienced these CapEx spending cycles over the 40 years we have been serving this market, and we believe the near-term cyclicality will not change the longer-term secular trend of increasing global tower and network hub counts and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications and related services that are requiring significantly greater power reliability. Internationally, total sales were pressured by lower intersegment sales, primarily related to declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the domestic telecom market as well as lower shipments of portable generators in Europe as energy security concerns resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war continue to abate.\nHelping to offset this weakness, international net sales in other emerging markets such as India, the Middle East and East Asia grew at a strong rate during the quarter. International growth remains an important strategic focus for us moving forward with significant opportunities and continued geographic expansion and further penetration of underserved markets as we implement the generic playbook across a growing global footprint.\nAs disclosed in our press release this morning, we expect global C&I product sales to decline by approximately 10% for full year 2024, as weakness in shipments to certain direct telecom, rental and beyond standby customers is expected to more than offset growth in other regions and channels. In closing this morning, we believe our fourth quarter results reflect a return to positive momentum in our overall business as our residential product sales began to grow again, which should help to offset cyclical softness in certain C&I customers and end markets.\nWe believe we are nearing the end of the excess field inventory overhang for home standby generators and expect to realize strong year-over-year growth in shipments of these products in 2024. This momentum gives us confidence in continuing to focus on building out our longer-term vision for both residential and C&I energy technology ecosystems. Our record cash flow performance in the fourth quarter is continued evidence of the earnings power of our business and gives us flexibility to prioritize further organic investments, execute on strategic acquisitions and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. Most importantly of all, the mega trends that support our longer-term opportunities remain firmly intact and our conviction in our powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy is as strong as ever.\nI'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter 2023 results in more detail. Net sales increased 1% to $1.06 billion during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of favorable contributions from acquisitions and foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2023 decreased 12% to approximately $4.02 billion. The combination of favorable contributions from acquisitions and foreign currency had an approximate 2% impact on revenue during the full year.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 1% to $580 million as compared to $575 million in the prior year. Growth in residential product sales was driven by a strong 10% increase in shipments of home standby generators and a more modest increase in energy technology products led by Ecobee. This was partially offset by lower portable generator shipments in the U.S. and Europe, given a tough prior year comparison.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased slightly to $363 million as compared to $361 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from foreign currency and the refuse storage acquisition contributed approximately 3% growth during the quarter. This core sales decline is due to weakness in sales to our domestic telecom and national equipment rental customers, partially offset by an increase in C&I product shipments to industrial distributors and direct customers for beyond standby applications, in addition to strengthening international sales into emerging markets.\nNet sales for the other products and services increased approximately 6% to $120 million as compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Core sales growth of 5% was primarily due to growth in our domestic C&I service offerings from our owned industrial distributors, aftermarket service parts, connectivity subscription revenue and Ecobee services. Gross profit margin was 36.5% compared to 32.7% in the prior year fourth quarter as a result of favorable sales mix, production efficiencies and lower raw material and logistics costs as supply chain challenges abated relative to the prior year.\nOperating expenses increased $2 million or 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by higher employee and marketing costs. The current year and prior year quarters also include approximately $11 million and $10 million, respectively, of onetime items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operations. See the reconciliation schedules in our earnings release for more information on these items.\nAdjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $213 million or 20% of net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to $174 million or 16.6% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest was $638 million or 15.9% of net sales as compared to $825 million or 18.1% in the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 1% to $891 million in the quarter as compared to $881 million in the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment was $192 million, representing 21.6% of total sales as compared to $144 million in the prior year or 16.4%. For the full year 2023, domestic segment total sales decreased 15% over the prior year to $3.32 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 15.8% compared to 18.2% in the prior year full year. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 13% to $190 million in the quarter as compared to $219 million in the prior year quarter, including an approximate 7% sales growth contribution from foreign currency and acquisitions, resulting in approximately 20% core total sales decline.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests was $20.4 million or 10.7% of total sales as compared to $29.5 million or 13.5% in the prior year quarter. For the full year of 2023, International segment total sales increased 6% over the prior year to $838 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests were 13.7% of total sales during 2023 as compared to 13.8% in the prior year full year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of '23 on a consolidated basis, as disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $97 million as compared to $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The current year net income includes approximately $5 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates.\nGAAP income taxes for the current year fourth quarter were $30 million or an effective tax rate of 23.7% as compared to $13.6 million or an effective tax rate of 15.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax benefits in the prior year quarter that did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.57 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.83 in the prior year.\nThe strong year-over-year increase in net earnings per share relative to growth in net income was primarily driven by an unfavorable $18.4 million redeemable nonc-ontrolling interest redemption value adjustment that was recorded in the prior year period as well as a lower share count in the current year period. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $126 million in the current year quarter or $2.07 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $113 million in the prior year or $1.78 per share.\nCash flow from operations was $317 million as compared to $101 million in the prior year fourth quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time quarterly record of $266 million as compared to $80 million in the same quarter last year. The significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to a $144 million reduction in inventory during the quarter and higher operating earnings. This was partially offset by higher capital expenditures during the current year quarter.\nTotal debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.58 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 2.5x on an as-reported basis. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $151 million. As disclosed in our press release this morning, the company's Board of Directors has approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock over a 24-month period, replacing the remaining balance on the previous program.\nFor the full year, cash flow from operations was an all-time record of $522 million as compared to $59 million in the prior year. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $396 million as compared to minus $24 million in 2022. We strategically deployed approximately $153 million of capital in 2023, with the acquisition of refuse storage systems, the purchase of the remaining 20% minority ownership interest in Pramac and the minority investment in Wallbox. In addition, capital expenditures totaled $129 million to support additional capacity for future organic growth.\nWe also opportunistically repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $252 million during the second half of the year. Moving forward, we will continue to operate within our disciplined and balanced capital allocation framework as we accelerate our powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy and execute other shareholder value-enhancing opportunities.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we're initiating 2024 net sales guidance that anticipates a return to growth for the full year period. This increase is expected to be led by higher home standby generator sales as shipments are projected to be more closely aligned with activations during 2024. We also expect our residential energy technology sales to grow as we expand distribution and launch our next-generation energy storage system later in 2024, and we continue to drive strong growth with our Ecobee products and solutions.\nOverall, we expect residential product sales to grow in the mid-teens range for 2024. However, in our C&I product category, cyclical pressures for certain telecom, rental and beyond standby customers, are expected to be more than offset or expected to more than offset continued growth in broader C&I end markets around the world. As a result, we are projecting global C&I sales to decline by approximately 10% and in 2024 compared to the prior year. As a result of these factors, we expect consolidated net sales for the full year to increase between 3% to 7% as compared to the prior year, which includes a slight favorable benefit from foreign currency.\nImportantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a Category 3 or higher landed hurricane or major winter storm, which we believe could add $50 million to $100 million of sales.\nAs a result of this top line outlook, we expect sales to be in line with normal historical seasonality, resulting in overall net sales in the first half being approximately 45% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 55% weighted. Specifically for the first quarter, we expect overall net sales to be nearly flat from the prior year first quarter, with solid growth in residential product sales offset by a decline in C&I product shipments.\nWith Q1 2024 being the seasonal low point of the year, we expect sales for each product class to increase sequentially throughout the year. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2024, we expect the realization of lower input costs and favorable mix impact from higher home standby sales volumes to drive continued year-over-year improvement throughout the year. As a result, we expect gross margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points for the full year as compared to 2023.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, we expect gross margins to increase by approximately 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter to approximately 34% to 34.5% due to favorable sales mix impact from higher home standby shipments and realization of lower input costs. These factors are also expected to result in sequential gross margin improvement into the second half of the year, with second half gross margins projected in the 38% range.\nWith respect to operating expenses, we continue to invest heavily in the resources needed to position our business for longer-term growth in new and existing markets, maintaining a heavy focus on supporting innovation, and executing our strategic initiatives across the enterprise. As a result of these investments, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of sales to be approximately 23% for the full year 2024. We expect to leverage these costs as we sequentially grow from first half to second half, helping to improve our EBITDA margins throughout the year. As a result of our gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be approximately 16.5% to 17.5% for the full year, compared to 15.9% in 2023.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly as we move throughout the year. Specifically, regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be the lowest for the year in the mid-12% range, and then improved sequentially throughout the year, returning to approximately 20% in the fourth quarter. As a result, second half adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nearly 600 basis points higher than the first half margins.\nAdditionally, as Aaron discussed, we continue to make significant investments in our residential energy technology products and solutions to capitalize on the opportunities presented by these robust long-term growth markets. As a result, we currently expect residential energy technology to dilute our EBITDA margins by approximately 350 to 400 basis points for the full year 2024, similar to the level of dilution experienced in 2023. As is our normal practice, we're also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2024. Importantly, we arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate. For 2024, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 25% to 26% as compared to 25.2% full year GAAP tax rate for 2023.\nWe expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million to $90 million, assuming no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year, and assuming sulfur rates declined throughout 2024 in line with market expectations. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. at the high end of our historical range as we add incremental C&I manufacturing capacity and execute other projects to support future growth expectations.\nDepreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $70 million to $73 million in 2024, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expenses in 2024 is expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $55 million to $60 million for the year. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year in 2024, similar to 2023. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income to be strong at approximately 100% as we continue to monetize working capital builds of prior years.\nOur full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to decrease to approximately 61 million shares as compared to 62.1 million shares in 2023, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in the latter half of 2023.\nFinally, this 2024 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect improving operating performance led primarily by continued strength in C&I product shipments and sequential growth in home standby generator shipments.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales decreased 2% to $1.07 billion with core sales declining 4% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 15% as compared to the prior year, representing a significant improvement in sales decline from the prior 2 quarters as field inventory levels of home standby generators continued to decline during the quarter and portable generator sales decreased from a strong prior year comparison that included the impact of Hurricane Ian.\nGlobal C&I product sales increased approximately 24% to an all-time quarterly record with growth across nearly all regions. We returned to year-over-year margin expansion for gross and adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter, driven by lower input costs and continued production efficiencies. In addition, we generated significant free cash flow during the quarter, allowing us to complete approximately $100 million of share repurchases.\nThird quarter home standby shipments grew at a strong sequential rate but declined on a year-over-year basis as we continued our efforts to reduce field inventory levels. Power outage activity in the U.S. was well above the long-term baseline average during the quarter despite not having the benefit of a major outage event, which we had experienced in the third quarter of each of the 3 previous years.\nAgainst a strong comparable period, the higher outage activity combined with well-publicized grid stability issues drove home consultations in the quarter meaningfully higher from the prior year and marked the second highest quarter on record behind only the third quarter of 2021, which included the impact of Hurricane Ita and was only months after the Texas deep-freeze major event in February of 2021.\nOur residential dealer count was approximately 8,700 at the end of the quarter. An increase of 200 from the prior year and over 2,000 from pre-COVID levels. Additionally, we continue to make good progress in training nondealer contractors as our initiatives to grow installation capacity maintained positive momentum in the third quarter.\nActivations which are a proxy for installations improved at a solid sequential rate in the quarter, but declined from a strong comparable period in 2022 that marked an all-time high for a third quarter. Activations in the month of October continued this strong sequential improvement, providing further confidence that the home standby market has formed and is holding a new and higher baseline level of demand.\nThe number of home standby generators in our distribution channels declined further in the quarter as we continue to make progress in reducing field inventories. As previously disclosed, certain regions and channels are at healthier levels of field inventory than others. And field inventory levels of certain models are declining more quickly than others.\nAlthough we continue to undership end market demand during the third quarter, the gap between shipments and activations narrowed meaningfully as compared to the first half of the year. These factors, together with the continued strength in leading indicators of demand during the third quarter support our projection for home standby generator sales, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 while still working to reduce field inventory to more sustainable levels. In addition to the positive near-term momentum that is building within the home standby market, we remain confident in the long-term outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day in September.\nThe megatrends that are driving awareness for backup power remain as compelling as ever. As electrification trends drive demand forward and the adoption of intermittent renewable power generation accelerates, we expect that consumers will become even more reliant on an electrical grid that is increasingly susceptible to power outages caused by the combined threats of more severe and volatile weather and deteriorating supply-demand dynamics.\nWe believe home standby generators will remain the most effective and economical solution for whole home resiliency for many years to come as homeowners look for peace of mind to address the impact of increasingly frequent and longer duration power outages.\nIn addition to the stronger-than-expected home standby shipments, our Residential Energy Technology Products and Solutions returned to year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter as continued strength in Ecobee sales more than offset weakness in shipments of our power cell energy storage systems as broader market conditions for residential solar and energy storage deteriorated further in the quarter.\nAs a result of these softer end market conditions, we now expect full year 2023 gross sales for residential energy technology to be approximately 10% below our prior guidance of $300 million. Ecobee continues to take market share with strategic retail partners in the smart thermostat market and the team successfully launched our new smart doorbell camera in the month of October.\nIn addition to providing increased levels of homeowner engagement with our home energy management platform, the smart doorbell camera showcases Ecobee's ability to drive innovation and differentiated product development. Ecobee's strong product development capabilities, combined with their focus on creating an exceptional user experience are central to the continued build-out of our home energy ecosystem.\nAlso during the third quarter, we announced the opening of a new engineering center of excellence in Reno, Nevada. This facility will house the development and testing of batteries, switches, power electronics and other clean energy solutions as we continue to invest in the R&D infrastructure and world-class talent that is required to develop and test the innovative residential energy technology solutions we are bringing to the market in the years ahead.\nAdditionally, our grid services team was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy in the month of October as part of the grid resilience and innovation partnerships program to pursue a project demonstrating the efficient building electrification can be achieved while minimizing system overload, reliability issues and the need for infrastructure upgrades. We're proud to receive this validation of our vision to utilize multiple energy technologies to support homeowners while providing valuable products and services that benefit both the grid and homeowners.\nI now want to provide commentary on our C&I products, which continue to outperform our expectations in the quarter. Domestic C&I product sales grew at a robust rate compared to the prior year as strength in shipments to customers for beyond standby applications and industrial distributors more than offset weaknesses in the telecom channel during the quarter. Shipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects, again grew at an exceptional rate during the third quarter.\nWe believe we are in the very early innings of this compelling new market opportunity as ongoing grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets drive interest in these solutions. These emerging applications are just one of the many ways that we're leveraging our position as the leading provider of natural gas generators to support increased adoption of energy technology solutions in C&I end markets. We also continue to build an increasingly comprehensive solution set to enable the deployment of our products in multi-asset applications, such as pairing our smart grid ready generators with our emerging C&I storage, connectivity, advanced controls and grid services platforms. Shipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel also grew again at a strong rate.\nQuoting activity remained resilient in the quarter, growing on a year-over-year basis and supporting our expectations for continued growth in this important channel that serves a wide range of end markets. As previously disclosed, order patterns from rental companies have moderated after several quarters of exceptional performance. And third quarter sales to our national and independent rental equipment customers were approximately flat from the prior year.\nDespite the expected near-term softness, we continue to expect that this historically cyclical end market has a substantially long-term runway for growth given the critical need for future infrastructure-related projects that leverage our products sold to this channel. As expected, sales to national telecom customers declined during the third quarter as compared to a strong prior year comparison.\nWhile we continue to expect shipment and order trends for these products to be softer in the coming quarters, we believe investment in telecom infrastructure remains a secular trend as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency. While we are seeing near-term softness in the telecom and rental channels as previously expected, the longer-term growth opportunity for backup power and energy technology solutions in C&I end markets remain significant.\nTo help serve the expected future demand growth, we recently announced an expansion project in [ Beberdan], Wisconsin, which is scheduled to be complete in early 2025, and will expand our manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a range of C&I stationary products for the North American market.\nTotal sales for our International segment increased 14% year-over-year during the third quarter with the combined impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency effects contributing approximately 11% sales growth. Core total sales growth was driven by strength in important long-term growth markets such as India, Latin America, Australia and the Middle East, partially offset by lower portable generator sales in Europe as energy security concerns in the region have moderated from peak levels seen in prior quarters. International growth remains an important strategic focus as we replicate the Generac playbook in a growing number of regions around the world.\nGeographic expansion, together with the increasing breadth of our product portfolio of backup power and energy technology solutions is expected to drive continued growth in the segment. Power resiliency concerns related to increasingly severe and volatile weather and rising supply/demand imbalances are not unique to North America. And as the global energy transition accelerates amid rising geopolitical tensions, we will continue to support businesses and homeowners in solving for their energy resiliency needs.\nIn closing this morning, our third quarter results and reiteration of our full year 2023 overall net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance reflect improving operating performance and the hard work and strong execution by our teams. We believe we are moving closer to more sustainable levels of field inventory for home standby generators as we experienced positive momentum in key fundamental metrics during the third quarter, supporting our expectation for a return to year-over-year sales growth for these products in the fourth quarter and 2024.\nThese sales growth expectations, together with the return to margin expansion and robust free cash flow generation, validate our commitment to a long-term focus on executing our powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy. We will continue to invest for future growth and position Generac growing residential and C&I energy ecosystems to drive value for homes and businesses around the world as detailed at our Investor Day in September. The megatrends that support the longer-term demand for growth profile for backup power and energy technology solutions remain firmly intact, and we maintain our conviction that Generac is uniquely positioned to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy future. I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our third quarter results and our remaining outlook for the year. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at our third quarter 2023 results in more detail. Overall net sales decreased 2% to $1.07 billion during the third quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.09 billion in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 2% net favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class, residential product sales declined 15% to $565 million as compared to $664 million in the prior year. As Aaron discussed in detail, lower shipments of home standby and portable generators drove this decline in residential product sales. To a lesser extent, Shore and clean energy products also contributed to the year-over-year decline, partially offset by growth in EcobeeSmart thermostat sales.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the third quarter of 2023 increased 24% to $385 million as compared to $311 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 5% revenue growth in the quarter. This strong core sales growth was driven by an increase in domestic shipments to industrial distributors and direct customers for beyond standby applications as well as a more modest growth in international shipments of C&I products. As expected, shipments to our telecom customers were down sharply compared to prior year.\nNet sales for other products and services increased 7% to $121 million as compared to $113 million in the third quarter of 2022. Core sales growth of 6% was primarily due to growth in sales of parts and accessories, company-owned industrial distributor project and service revenue and Energy Technology grid services revenue. Gross profit margin was 35.1% compared to 33.2% in the prior year third quarter as a result of lower raw material and logistics costs, production efficiencies and marginally higher pricing compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable sales mix, primarily driven by lower home standby shipments in the current year quarter.\nOperating expenses decreased $3 million or 1% as compared to the third quarter of 2022. As highlighted in our reconciliation schedules in the earnings release, the current year quarter included a $22 million provision for legal charges related to certain Ecobee patent litigation matters. The prior year includes $55 million of charges comprised of $18 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy and a $37 million charge for clean energy product warranty-related matters.\nExcluding these items in the current and prior year, operating expenses increased by $31 million or 14%, primarily driven by increased employee and marketing costs in the current year period and a favorable contingent consideration adjustment in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $189 million or 17.6% of net sales in the third quarter as compared to $184 million or 16.9% of net sales in the prior year. This improved EBITDA percent was primarily driven by higher gross margins as compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as we continue to invest for future growth.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 6% to $894 million in the quarter as compared to $947 million in the prior year, with minimal favorable impact from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $160 million, representing 17.9% of total sales as compared to $160 million in the prior year or 16.9% of total sales.\nInternational segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 14% to $208 million in the quarter as compared to $183 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $28 million or 13.6% of net sales as compared to $24 million or 13.2% of net sales in the prior year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $60 million as compared to $58 million in the third quarter of 2022. In addition to the items just discussed, the current year net income includes approximately $9 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates.\nGAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $19 million or an effective tax rate of 24.3% as compared to $12 million or an effective tax rate of 16.1% for the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year quarter, including certain favorable discrete tax items and a larger benefit from equity compensation as compared to the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.97 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.83 in the prior year.\nThe strong year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings per share relative to growth in GAAP net income was primarily driven by a lower share count in the current year period, coupled with the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment that was recorded in the prior year period. See our earnings per share footnote for further information on our EPS calculations.\nAdjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $102 million in the current year quarter or $1.64 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $112 million in the prior year or $1.75 per share.\nCash flow from operations was $140 million as compared to minus $56 million in the prior year third quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $117 million as compared to minus $73 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily due to a significant use of cash for working capital in the prior year period that did not repeat in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher interest payments and capital expenditures.\nTotal debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.58 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2.6x on an as-reported basis. Additionally, during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 876,000 shares of our common stock for $100 million. There is approximately $178 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of the third quarter.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our remaining outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our overall net sales outlook for the full year 2023. We continue to expect overall net sales for the full year to decline between minus 10% to minus 12% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 2% net favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency.\nLooking at the product class mix, given the outperformance of C&I products and softness in Shore and clean energy products during the third quarter, we now expect the mix of C&I product shipments for the full year to be approximately 100 basis points higher relative to our previous guidance, with the offset in residential product shipment mix.\nOur gross margin expectations for the full year 2023 are also unchanged as we still anticipate approximately 100 basis points of gross margin improvement over 2022 levels, driven primarily by favorable price cost benefits, partially offset by the unfavorable mix impact resulting from lower home standby generator sales for the full year.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are still expected to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5% for the full year, implying that fourth quarter 2023 EBITDA margins would be over 20%, a significant improvement over prior year fourth quarter. We expect to generate strong operating free cash flow in the fourth quarter, resulting in an adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion at well over 100% for the full year as inventory levels are projected to further moderate. This return to robust free cash flow generation allows for continued capital allocation optionality as we move through the remainder of the year.\nWe are also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the full year 2023. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using the expected effective tax rate. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25%. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $95 million compared to the prior guidance of approximately $92 million due to higher projected interest rates and borrowings.\nOur capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is still forecast to be approximately $62 million in 2023. GAAP intangible amortization expense is now expected to be approximately $104 million during the year as compared to the previous guidance of $102 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year.\nGiven the share repurchases executed during the third quarter of 2023, our full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to decrease to approximately 62.3 million shares. And finally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our second quarter net sales were in line with our prior expectations as stronger-than-expected C&I product shipments offset residential products which were lower than expected as a result of a softer consumer spending environment that impacted shipments of home standby generators and shore products. This had an unfavorable mix effect on gross margins, resulting in slightly lower adjusted EBITDA margins than previously expected. Year-over-year, overall net sales decreased 23% to $1 billion, and core sales declined 26% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 44% as compared to a strong prior year quarter that benefited from significant excess backlog reduction for home standby generators. The current year quarter continued to be impacted by elevated levels of field inventory for home standby generators as well as a decline in clean energy product shipments year-over-year.\nGlobal C&I product sales increased approximately 24% to an all-time quarterly record with broad-based growth across nearly all regions and channels. Adjusted EBITDA margins were negatively affected by the significant unfavorable sales mix as well as reduced operating leverage driven by lower home standby shipments and continued investments for future growth. Importantly, continued favorable price cost dynamics have created a meaningful margin tailwind in providing a partial offset to the unfavorable sales mix. Second quarter home standby shipments grew at a strong sequential rate but declined significantly on a year-over-year basis as the second quarter of 2022 included the reduction of excess backlog and we continue to meaningfully under-ship end market demand in the current quarter as we focused on further reducing field inventories of home standby generators. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. was well above the long-term average but meaningfully weighted toward the final weeks of the quarter. Home consultations or sales leads were roughly flat from the prior year period and increased sequentially off an unseasonably strong first quarter.\nAdditionally, home consultations during the second quarter was still more than 4x higher than the second quarter of 2019, further supporting our view that consumer interest in the product category has achieved a new and higher baseline level. Our residential dealer account returned to sequential growth in the quarter, ending at approximately 8,700, an increase of 500 dealers from the prior year. We continue to invest in growing the installation capacity of our channel partners, and we are making good progress towards our initiatives to increase dealer count, train nondealer contractors, streamline the installation process and raise home standby category awareness across trade groups. We believe these efforts are important to the longer-term growth trajectory of the product category as the mega trends that support the demand growth outlook remain firmly intact. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, improved sequentially over the first quarter, but declined from a strong comparable period in 2022 that included the benefit of a backlog of installations in certain regions during the prior year.\nActivations were also below our prior expectations for the quarter, primarily due to the weaker consumer spending environment for home improvement. But despite this relative softness, activations during the quarter were more than double second quarter 2019 levels. Close rates were flat sequentially and remained meaningfully higher than the comparable period of 2022, but underperformed our expectations as a result of the shift in consumer spending patterns. The number of home standby generators in field inventory further declined in the quarter, while days of field inventory relative to historical norms also decreased sequentially. However, with close rates and activations lower than expected in the quarter, the field inventory normalization process is now expected to extend further into the second half of the year. As a result, we expect the elevated field inventory levels to further impact home standby shipments in the second half relative to our prior expectations with the return to year-over-year growth in home standby shipments now anticipated in the fourth quarter.\nWe believe the stronger outage environment in the final weeks of the second quarter and the resulting strength in IHC support this expected return to growth later in the year. Longer term, the mega trends that are driving awareness for backup power solutions are as compelling as ever. homeowners and business owners are becoming increasingly sensitive to the growing frequency of power outages driven by extreme weather and grid operators are struggling to solve the growing supply demand imbalances that are a byproduct of the accelerated energy transition that is underway. Importantly, these are not short-term issues as the transition to the next-generation power grid will be an uneven process and is expected to take decades to complete. We believe our unparalleled suite of solutions is well positioned to solve many of the energy-related challenges that consumers and businesses will inevitably face.\nI now would like to provide some commentary on our core products, which consists of a broad lineup of outdoor specialty power equipment used for property maintenance in large residential and light commercial applications. These products, which are increasingly shifting towards battery-powered solutions experienced significant growth in recent years as homeowners have been spending more time to money on property maintenance since 2020. However, shipments in the second quarter declined from the prior year and were below our prior expectations as higher channel inventories in the industry, unfavorable weather trends and shifting consumer spending patterns impacted demand for core products. This weaker than previously expected demand environment is expected to persist in the second half of the year, also contributing to our lower outlook for residential product sales. Now moving to our Residential Energy Technology Products and Solutions. Second quarter sales were in line with our prior expectations and grew at a strong rate sequentially as shipments of our power cell energy storage systems improved and Ecobee sales hit an all-time record for a quarter.\nEcobee drove strong sales growth over the prior year and continue to take share in the smart thermostat market by strong positioning with professional contractors and new placement with key retailers. The Ecobee team is progressing towards the launch of a smart doorbell camera in the second half of this year which will provide for increased homeowner engagement with our home energy management platform. As the central hub of our home energy ecosystem, we firmly believe that Ecobee's feature-rich devices and significant expertise and user experience will provide to be will prove to be key differentiators for Generac's residential energy technology efforts. Although we are making progress in our future product road maps and rebuilding the confidence of solar installers, the broad residential solar and storage market in the U.S. is showing signs of slowing. As a result, we now expect our suite of residential energy technology products and solutions to deliver gross sales at the low end of our previous range between $300 million and $350 million for the full year 2023 as weaker solar and storage industry demand dynamics are expected to persist throughout the balance of the year.\nTo better compete in these large and growing market opportunities, we are continuing to invest heavily in the world-class talent and R&D infrastructure that is required to achieve next level quality while developing and commercializing innovative solutions. We believe our competitive advantages when we built around the combination of these ongoing investments, differentiated monitoring and management capabilities and a unique and seamless user experience. Combined with our core competencies around sales and marketing, lead generation, distribution, customer support and global sourcing. I'd now like to provide commentary on our C&I products, which once again outperformed our expectations. Global C&I product sales grew 24% over the prior year to an all-time quarterly record as multiple mega trends continue to support demand for backup power and mobile products around the world. Domestic C&I product sales grew at a robust rate in the second quarter, highlighted by strengthened shipments to a number of key customers for beyond standby applications, industrial distributors and national rental equipment companies.\nShipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects continued to see tremendous growth during the second quarter. We believe we are in the very early innings of this exciting new market opportunity as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these solutions. Leveraging our position as the leading provider of natural gas generators we are building an increasingly comprehensive solution set to enable the deployment of our products in multi-asset applications, such as pairing our smart grid ready generators with our emerging C&I storage, connectivity, advanced controls and grid services solutions. Shipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel grew once again at a strong rate and channel backlog also increased sequentially during the quarter. Quoting activity for C&I products remains robust, highlighting the ongoing strength in demand for backup power in this important channel that serves a wide range of end markets. In addition, we experienced another quarter of robust growth against a strong prior year comparison with our national and independent rental equipment customers as they continue to refresh and expand their fleets.\nWhile order patterns from rental companies have moderated after several quarters of exceptional performance, this end market has substantial runway for growth, supported by the critical need for future infrastructure-related investments. As the leading provider of backup power to the North American telecom market, sales to national telecom customers increased slightly during the second quarter as compared to a strong prior year comparison. Although we continue to expect shipments and order trends for these products to be uneven during the second half of the year, we believe investment in telecom infrastructure remains a secular trend as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency. Positive momentum also continued during the second quarter for our International segment as total sales increased 10% year-over-year with the combined impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency effects contributing approximately 4% to sales growth. Core total sales growth was driven by strength in nearly all regions as well as global sales of our controls and automation solutions from our Deep Sea and Motortech acquisitions.\nWhile energy security concerns in Europe have moderated from peak levels seen in prior quarters, we continue to see positive momentum in important long-term international growth markets, including India, the Middle East and Australia. As the global energy transition accelerates, Demand for electricity around the world grows and the threat of increasingly severe and volatile weather persists, we believe that the demand we are seeing in these markets supports our view that the need for power resilience is a global issue. Accordingly, we are continuing to invest and build out our international product and distribution capabilities to serve these large and diverse growth opportunities. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are raising our full year sales growth guidance for global C&I products to mid-teens range from prior expectations for a mid- to high single-digit increase. In addition to the strong second quarter performance, the increased guidance is being primarily driven by continued strong backlog and operational execution for our domestic C&I products.\nIn closing this morning, our C&I product category has continued to perform extremely well as our global teams have driven strong execution. But a softer than previously expected consumer environment impacted second quarter results and is the main driver in the reduction in our second half outlook for residential products. We view the headwinds in our residential product categories as temporary and we remain confident in the robust longer-term outlook for our broad portfolio of backup power products and energy technology solutions. This confidence combined with our history of strong cash flow generation and healthy financial profile allows us to maintain a long-term focus on executing our powering a smarter world enterprise strategy. We will continue to make the necessary investments to capitalize on the megatrends that drive the future growth opportunities inherent in this strategy. We look forward to providing a more detailed update on our longer-term strategic vision at our upcoming Investor Day in late September. I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on second quarter results as well as the outlook for 2023. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2023 results in more detail. Overall, net sales decreased 23% to $1 billion during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.29 billion in the prior year second quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency and approximately 3% net favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class. Residential product sales declined 44% to $499 million as compared to $896 million in the prior year. As Aaron discussed in detail, lower shipments of home standby generators, power cell energy storage systems and shore products drove this decline in residential product sales. In particular, for home standby, the year-over-year declines were due to a tough prior comparison where we were working down excess backlog, combined with the current year that is impacted by field inventory destocking.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the second quarter of 23 increased 24% to $384 million as compared to $309 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% revenue growth in the quarter. This very strong core sales growth was driven by broad-based growth across nearly all regions and channels, highlighted by an increase in domestic shipments to direct customers for beyond standby applications, industrial distributors and the national rental equipment channel. In addition, international shipments of C&I power generation products and controls and automation solutions also contributed to this growth. Net sales for other products and services increased 37% to $117 million as compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of electronic environments given their additional service capabilities. We called out if this acquisition closed last year on June 30. Gross profit margin was 32.8% compared to 35.4% in the prior year second quarter due to the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix given the sharp decline in home standby mix compared to the prior year.\nThis was partially offset by previously implemented pricing actions and lower input costs from improved commodities, logistics and plant efficiencies that are providing an important tailwind to margin trends that are expected to continue in the second half of 2023. Operating expenses increased $2 million or 1% as compared to the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased employee costs to drive and support future growth, higher marketing and promotion spend and the impact of recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions. This was mostly offset by lower variable operating expenses on the lower sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $137 million or 13.6% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to the $271 million or 21% of net sales in the prior year. This lower EBITDA percent was primarily driven by the higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, given the lower sales volumes compared to prior year and to a lesser extent, the lower gross margins.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 28% to $815 million in the quarter as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 3% revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $103 million, representing 12.7% of total sales as compared to $242 million in the prior year or 21.5% of total sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily driven by the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix and reduced operating leverage on the lower shipments. The impact of acquisitions and continued investments in future growth also negatively affected margins during the quarter. These margin headwinds were partially offset by favorable price and cost benefits. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 10% to $224 million in the quarter as compared to $203 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 6% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $33 million or 14.9% of net sales as compared to $30 million or 14.5% of net sales in the prior year. This stronger margin performance was primarily driven by favorable price and cost benefits. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $45 million, as compared to $156 million for the second quarter of 2022. The current year net income includes approximately $15 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates. In addition, income taxes during the current year second quarter was $16 million or an effective tax rate of 25.9% as compared to $46 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower benefit from equity compensation in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.70 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.2021 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $68 million in the current year quarter or $1.08 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $185 million in the prior year or $2.86 per share.\nCash flow from operations was $83 million as compared to $24 million in the prior year second quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $54 million as compared to $6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily due to significantly lower working capital investment in the current year quarter as inventory levels have stabilized, partially offset by lower operating earnings, higher interest payments and higher CapEx. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.62 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2.8x on an as-reported basis which is expected to moderate in the second half of the year as LTM EBITDA begins to increase. With that, I will now provide further comments on our outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are updating our outlook for the full year 2023. The softer than previously expected consumer spending environment for home improvement has impacted our outlook for residential products most notably for shipments of home standby generators.\nAs a result of the software consumer, we are seeing lower close rates and activations relative to prior expectations which is causing higher field inventories and lower distributor sentiment compared to our previous guidance commentary. As a result of these factors, we now expect residential product sales for the full year 2023 to decline in the mid-20% range compared to the prior year, which compares to our prior expectation for a decline in the high teens range. Partially offsetting this incremental weakness in residential products, we are raising our outlook for C&I product sales which are now expected to grow at a mid-teens rates during the year as compared to our prior guidance of a mid- to high single-digit rate. Overall net sales for the full year are now expected to decline between minus 10% to minus 12% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 2% net favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This compares to the previous guidance range of a decline between minus 6% to minus 10%. From a quarterly pacing perspective, we now expect a slight year-over-year decline in overall net sales for the third quarter with the return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter.\nThis guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the remainder of the year that is in line with the long-term baseline average. And consistent with our historical of course, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2023, we now anticipate approximately 100 basis points of gross margin improvement over 2022 levels. We still expect sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins in the third and fourth quarters with third quarter gross margins projected to be approximately 150 to 200 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. The anticipated sequential improvement in gross margins in the second half is expected to be driven by improved sales mix with higher shipments of home standby generators, lower input costs and the realization of cost reduction initiatives as compared to the first half of the year. Given the significant megatrends that support our long-term growth opportunities, we remain focused on driving innovation, executing our strategic initiatives, and investing for the future.\nAs a result of these ongoing investments, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 20% to 21% for the full year 2023. Given these gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5% for the full year 2023 compared to the previous guidance range of 17% to 18%. From a quarterly pacing perspective, we still expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year, primarily driven by sequentially improving gross margins as previously discussed, and to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on an expected higher sales volumes. Accordingly, we now expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 300 to 350 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. The and exit EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter of 2023 are expected to be in the low 20% range. Additionally, as Aaron discussed, we continue to make significant operating expense investments in our residential energy technology products and solutions to capitalize on the significant opportunities presented by the rapidly growing solar storage and energy management markets.\nAs a result, we currently expect these investments to unfavorably impact our EBITDA margins by approximately 400 basis points for the full year 2023. We continue to expect operating and free cash flow generation to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2023. For the full year, we expect adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion to be strong at well over 100% as working capital moderates off of peak levels. We're also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2023. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using the expected effective tax rate. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25% as compared to the 19.6% full year GAAP tax rate for 2022. The year-over-year increase is driven primarily by expectations for lower share-based compensation deductions and increased mix of income in higher tax jurisdictions, higher tax on foreign income in 2023 compared to 2022.\nInterest expense is now expected to be approximately $92 million compared to the prior guidance of approximately $90 million, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year, and current expectations for sulfur rates throughout 2023. Interest expenses is expected to moderate in the third and fourth quarters as cash flows on our interest rate swaps become more favorable and as we expect to pay down a portion of our outstanding revolver indebtedness. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecast in net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is now forecast to be approximately $62 million compared to the previous guidance of approximately $60 million in 2023. GAAP intangible amortization expense is now expected to be approximately $102 million during the year as compared to previous guidance of approximately $100 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year, and our full year weighted average diluted share count is still expected to approach 63 million shares as compared to 64.7 million shares in 2022, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in 2022.\nFinally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. As a reminder, we have $278 million of authorization remaining on our current share repurchase program. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mike Harris, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nMichael W. Harris\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors.\nIn addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were higher than expected, primarily due to continued strong shipments of our commercial and industrial products globally. Adjusted EBITDA margins were also better than expected due to favorable price cost dynamics. Additionally, field inventory levels of home standby generators declined at a rate consistent with our expectations in the quarter.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales decreased 22% to $888 million, and core sales declined 24% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 46% as compared to a strong prior year quarter that included the benefit of significant excess backlog for home standby generators and was also impacted by elevated levels of field inventory for home standby generators as well as a decline in clean energy products.\nGlobal C&I product sales increased approximately 30% to an all-time quarterly record with strength in most regions internationally and all channels domestically. Adjusted EBITDA margin was negatively affected by significant unfavorable sales mix and reduced operating leverage driven by lower home standby shipments and continued energy technology growth investments.\nThese margin headwinds were mostly offset by favorable price cost dynamics. Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail. While home standby shipments declined significantly in the quarter, leading indicators of demand for the category were exceptionally strong during the first quarter. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. was well above the long-term average during the quarter with several larger localized outages in multiple regions, marking the highest level of baseline power outage activity for our first quarter since we began tracking outages in 2010.\nHome consultations or sales leads were up significantly over the prior year period with broad-based growth experienced in almost all states. Additionally, home consultations were approximately flat sequentially during the quarter, which is highly unusual for the seasonally softer first quarter, particularly as we are coming off of a record fourth quarter, and this strength continued in the month of April.\nFor historical perspective, first quarter home consultations were more than 4x higher than the comparable period in 2019. Supporting our belief that the home standby generator category has reached a new and higher baseline level of demand. Our residential dealer count was more than 8,600 at the end of the quarter, an increase of over 500 dealers from the prior year.\nWhile this is a slight decline on a sequential basis due to seasonal headwinds, we expect our dealer count to grow significantly over the coming years as we continue to focus on expanding our installation bandwidth. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, were impacted by severe weather in multiple regions and declined slightly from the prior year period, which included a challenging comparison in the South Central region that saw a notable strength in the prior year due to the backlog of activations related to the Texas deep freeze in 2021.\nThe number of home standby generators in field inventory continued to decline towards more normalized levels during the first quarter with the number of units falling meaningfully and ending the quarter approximately in line with our prior expectations. Days of field inventory relative to historical norms also decreased sequentially in the quarter but remained elevated. We expect field inventory to decline further in the second quarter, resulting in another quarter of lower home standby orders and shipments relative to the higher end market demand before returning to more normalized levels as we enter the second half of the year.\nOur initiative to increase home standby generator installation capacity remains a top priority for the company. We recently launched our dealer talent network, which is showing early signs of momentum as we help our dealers find the talent needed to successfully grow their businesses. We also recently announced a partnership with the independent electrical contractors Trade Group aimed at further elevating the Generac brand within the electrical contractor community and providing additional training resources in key markets, including Texas and Florida.\nAdditionally, we have identified a number of project management improvement opportunities that we believe can help dealers optimize overall project time lines in addition to several product-related enhancements to further simplify the installation process. These initiatives are not only focused on solving near-term installation capacity challenges, but are also designed to provide sustainable solutions for tighter skilled labor markets.\nWe believe these solutions as well as continuing to expand overall distribution could further increase Generac's competitive advantage given our unparalleled scale, focus and expertise in the home standby market. Consistent with the comments provided on our fourth quarter earnings call in mid-February, we expect that the first quarter marked the trough for home standby shipments in the current channel destocking process.\nWe continue to anticipate a return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of the year as field inventory returns to more normalized levels. The above-average outage environment and robust growth in home consultations thus far in 2023 further support this expectation.\nThe range of threats that utilities and grid operators face was on full display in recent quarters as the outage environment has been driven by severe weather power supply shortfalls and unanticipated spikes in demand. Outage events are no longer limited to one-off major storms. And as reliance on electricity continues to grow, consumers and businesses have demonstrated that they are less willing to accept a deteriorating level of power liability and they are taking actions to improve their own resiliency.\nI'd now like to provide some commentary on our residential energy technology products and solutions. While we're facing temporary headwinds for our residential clean energy offerings, our commitment to success in these markets has not changed. This strategically important area of our business gives us access to a number of highly attractive market opportunities that are supported by strong end demand and further reinforced by unprecedented levels of policy support.\nWe expect that the combined served addressable market for residential solar MLPs, storage, EV charging, home energy monitoring and management and grid services will grow at strong double-digit CAGR through 2026, resulting in a domestic market opportunity of more than $10 billion.\nDuring the first quarter, shipments of power cell energy storage systems remained under pressure as we continue to rebuild and add to our distribution for these products following the loss of a large customer that ceased operations in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, we continue to make good progress on our Snap RS upgrade campaign in the quarter, and we remain committed to taking care of our customers and the channel partners that are participating in this program.\nIn addition to our residential storage efforts, our energy monitoring and management capabilities remain well positioned as positive momentum in ecobee's device sales, together with a number of product awards are resulting in continued market share gains and highlight the consumer appeal of our feature-rich smart thermostat offerings. Ecobee's already strong customer satisfaction scores have improved further since the 2022 release of our latest generation devices, validating Ecobee's expertise in user interface and user experience development.\nWe are heavily leveraging that expertise in our single pane of glass initiative, which will act as the central hub of our residential energy ecosystem. It's also worth noting that customer interest in our grid services offerings remained strong with another quarter of robust sales growth off of a low prior year base.\nWe recently announced a strategic minority investment enrolling energy resources and EV load management software provider as part of our effort to be the leading solution for EV load management to utilities and consumers. We believe this innovative area of our business will help facilitate the transition to the next-generation grid and ongoing policy support remains a potential tailwind as regulators and policymakers increasingly recognize the value of flexible digital solutions to the challenges facing our evolving power grid.\nWe continue to expect gross sales from residential energy technology products and services to deliver between $300 million and $350 million for the full year 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be elevated in 2023 and as we continue to build a home energy technology foundation for growth to position our combination of hardware and software solutions for long-term success.\nWith new leadership running this part of our business, our teams are focused on more deeply integrating the products and platforms we've acquired over the past 4 years. With an eye towards tightening our focus on the solutions where we believe we can create the most value for the consumer as part of the residential energy ecosystem.\nWith improved focus and execution and by leveraging our core competencies around sales and marketing, lead generation, distribution, customer support and global sourcing and logistics, we believe we can create competitive advantages with our residential energy technology products and services that will become evident over time as we continue to develop the smart energy home in the future.\nSwitching gears, and I want to provide some commentary on our C&I products which have experienced significant growth over the last 2 years and once again outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Global C&I product sales grew 30% over the prior year to an all-time quarterly record. And backlog for these products also remained at record levels at the end of the quarter as multiple megatrends support demand for backup power and mobile products around the world.\nShipments for domestic C&I products grew in the first quarter, highlighted by strength across all channels, including national rental equipment, industrial distributors, telecom and other direct customers for beyond standby applications.\nShipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel grew significantly again in the first quarter and order trends and channel backlog also increased at a strong rate. Quoting activity remains robust and close rates improved nicely on a year-over-year basis, highlighting our sustained market share gains and the ongoing strength in demand for backup power in this important channel.\nAs a leading provider of backup power to the North American telecom market, shipments to national telecom customers also increased at a robust rate during the first quarter as compared to the prior -- the strong prior year comparison, as several of our larger national customers continue to deploy generators to harden their existing sites and build out their fifth generation or 5G networks.\nWhile shipment and order patterns for certain customers in this channel are expected to be lumpy in the second half of the year, Investment in telecom infrastructure remains a secular trend as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency.\nWe also experienced another quarter of tremendous growth for our national and independent rental equipment customers as they continue to refresh and expand their fleets. This end market is supported by the secular trend of critical need for significant infrastructure investments that will require years to complete, and mobile power products and light towers will be necessary in these essential construction projects.\nNatural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects also continued to see increased traction during the first quarter as shipments of these products once again grew at an exceptional rate. We believe we are in the very early innings of growth for this exciting new market opportunity as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these solutions.\nAdditionally, the business models of our direct customers in this vertical are innovating in the generator marketplace by developing as-a-service offerings, which dramatically reduces the need for the large initial capital outlays that have traditionally been required for businesses to add resiliency to their operations.\nInternationally, robust momentum continued as shipments increased 17% year-over-year during the first quarter with 19% core sales growth when excluding the net impact of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Core total sales growth was driven by strength across key regions, most notably in Europe, where Power Security for homes and businesses remain the top priority amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty.\nInternational segment EBITDA margins also increased meaningfully during the quarter, primarily due to favorable price cost dynamics and improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes. Supplementing our international performance, we're also beginning to see long-term growth potential emerge in new and developing regions such as India, where we are experiencing positive sales momentum for our backup power solutions.\nThis rapidly growing market has unique characteristics for a developing country with the size of its population, broad electrical infrastructure coverage and an increasing number of homes and businesses with direct natural gas connections.\nWe are currently building out our full range of residential and C&I gas solutions to address this large market opportunity. Additionally, during the quarter, we acquired the remaining 20% minority ownership interest in Pramac, bringing our total ownership to 100%. Pramac is a leading designer and manufacturer of stationary, mobile and portable generators along with energy storage solutions sold through a broad distribution network across the world and it has been a key driver of our successful international expansion since we first acquired a majority interest in the company in early 2016.\nThrough the combination of focused investment and Pramac's global presence. This has become an important strategic element of our international growth aspirations. As we've been experiencing on the residential side of our business, our global C&I product category is similarly in the very early innings of its own energy technology evolution and we've made meaningful progress towards that evolution here in 2023.\nIn addition to our advanced controls and connectivity solutions, beyond standby natural gas generators and mobile energy storage systems, we've now added stationary energy storage solutions for behind-the-meter applications, both domestically and internationally to our product portfolio.\nIn February, we acquired Retro Storage Systems, a German-based developer and supplier of energy storage hardware products, advanced software and platform services for international commercial and industrial customers. We also recently announced our new series of Generac branded stationary energy storage systems for the North American C&I market in partnership with a leading supplier of behind-the-meter storage solutions.\nThese developments represent our initial foray into this rapidly growing market and advancing our C&I storage capabilities will remain a key initiative for Generac in the coming years. The long-term opportunity for Energy Technology solutions within our C&I product category is extremely robust, and I'm confident in our ability to leverage our existing position of strength around the world to compete in these markets.\nIn closing this morning, we believe our first quarter performance represents a trough in the current cycle as we continue to focus on reducing home standby field inventory levels and as we work to rebuild sales momentum for our power cell residential energy storage systems. That said, we're extremely pleased with the continued execution in our global C&I product categories that drove overall results ahead of our prior expectations, and we're encouraged by the progress we're making in addressing the near-term challenges that are impacting our residential product categories.\nIn addition, the robust level of power outage activity and resulting strength in home consultations for home standby generators so far here in 2023, provides incremental support for our expectations to return to year-over-year sales growth in the residential product category in the second half of the year.\nImportantly, we're maintaining our full year net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance as we execute on our near-term initiatives and position Generac for sustained long-term success in our mission to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide additional details on our first quarter results and discuss our outlook for 2023. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2022 results in more detail. Net sales decreased 22% to $888 million during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.14 billion in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 2% net favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Weekly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class.\nResidential product sales declined 46% to $419 million as compared to $777 million in the prior year. As Aaron discussed in detail, lower shipments of home standby generators and power cell energy storage systems drove this decline in residential product sales. Commercial and industrial product sales for the first quarter of 2023 increased 30% to $363 million as compared to $279 million in the prior year quarter.\nContributions from recent acquisitions were nearly fully offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency during the quarter. The very strong core sales growth was broad-based across most regions internationally and all channels domestically with particular strength in the domestic national rental equipment industrial distributors, telecom and other direct customers for beyond standby applications.\nNet sales for other products and services increased 32% to $106 million as compared to $80 million in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition of electronic environments contributed approximately 28% of this growth given their additional service capabilities. Core sales growth for the category was approximately 4%, primarily due to growth in our Energy Technology Service offerings, along with continued growth in aftermarket service parts and extended warranty revenue recognition.\nGross profit margin was 30.7% compared to 31.8% in the prior year first quarter due to the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix given the sharp decline in home standby mix compared to the prior year. This was mostly offset by realization of previously implemented pricing actions, together with lower input costs from improved commodities, logistics, plant efficiency and other cost reduction efforts.\nOperating expenses increased $22 million or 11% as compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by higher marketing, promotion and employee costs certain legal and regulatory expenses and the impact of recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $100 million, or 11.3% of net sales in the first quarter as compared to $196 million and 16.3% of net sales in the prior year.\nThe lower EBITDA percent was primarily driven by the higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, given the lower sales compared to the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales including intersegment sales decreased 26% to $720 million in the quarter as compared to $975 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 3% revenue growth for the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment was $68 million, representing a 9.4% margin as compared to $170 million in the prior year or 17.5% of total sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and reduced operating leverage on lower shipments. In addition, the impact of acquisitions and continued energy technology growth investments negatively affected margins during the quarter.\nThese factors were partially offset by the realization of previously implemented pricing actions and lower input costs. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 17% to $216 million in the quarter as compared to $185 million in the prior year quarter.\nCore sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 19% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests was $32 million or 15% of net sales as compared to $26 million or 14% of sales in the prior year. This margin increase was driven primarily by favorable price cost dynamics and improved operating leverage on higher volumes.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $12 million, as compared to $114 million for the first quarter of 2022.\nThe current year net income includes approximately $13 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates. Income taxes during the current year first quarter were $8 million or an effective tax rate of 35.7% as compared to $29 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% for the prior year.\nThe increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower benefit from equity compensation on a low pretax earnings base in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.05 for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1.57 in the prior year.\nAdjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release, was $39 million in the current year quarter or $0.63 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $128 million in the prior year or $1.98 per share. Cash flow used in operations was negative $19 million as compared to negative $10 million in the prior year first quarter.\nAnd free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was negative $42 million as compared to negative $37 million in the same quarter last year. The modest decline in free cash flow was primarily due to lower operating earnings and a $36 million one-time cash tax payment for tax planning related to a recent acquisition.\nThis was mostly offset by lower working capital investment in the current year quarter as we reduce our material receipts and production rates for residential products and stabilized inventory levels. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.61 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2.25x on an as-reported basis.\nOutstanding debt increased $179 million during the current year quarter as we used proceeds from those borrowings to fund the $105 million Pramac buyout, the $36 million onetime cash tax paid for tax plan purposes and a $16 million [indiscernible] storage acquisition.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our prior outlook for the full year 2023. We continue to expect the residential product category will be impacted by higher home standby field inventory levels in the second quarter before returning to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of the year, resulting in a full year decline in the high teens range compared to the prior year.\nOur outlook for C&I product sales to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate during the year remains unchanged as we come up against increasingly challenging prior year comparisons in the second half of the year. As a result, we continue to expect overall net sales for the full year to decline between minus 6% to minus 10% as compared to the prior year which includes approximately 1% to 2% favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency.\nImportantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the remainder of the year that is in line with the longer-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year. Additionally, this outlook does not assume a prolonged deep recessionary environment that meaningfully impacts consumer spending during 2023.\nHaving said that, demand for our home standby products tends to be driven more by power outages rather than overall macroeconomic conditions. We continue to expect sales to be more weighted to the back half of the year as field inventory normalizes and consistent with normal seasonality, excluding excess backlog with overall net sales in the first half now being approximately 45% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 55% weighted.\nOur gross margin expectations for the full year 2023 are also unchanged as we anticipate approximately 150 basis points of gross margin improvement over 2022 levels. From a seasonality perspective, we continue to expect that first quarter gross margins will mark the low point for the year.\nWe anticipate sequential quarterly improvements resulting from improved sales mix with higher shipments of home standby generators along with lower input costs, improved overhead absorption and realization of cost reduction initiatives as we move throughout the year. Gross margins are expected to progressively improve throughout the year with second half 2023 gross margins to be approximately 500 basis points higher than first half 2023 margins.\nThe continued strength of our end markets gives us the confidence to continue to focus heavily on supporting innovation, executing on strategic initiatives and investing for future growth. As a result of these continued investments, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding intangible amortization expense, to be approximately 20% for the full year 2023, with operating leverage improving throughout the year.\nGiven these gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are still expected to be approximately 17% to 18% for the full year. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly throughout the year, primarily driven by sequentially improving gross margins as previously discussed, and, to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on the expected higher sales volumes in the second half of 2023.\nAccordingly, we continue to expect second half adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 800 basis points higher than first half margins. We're also providing updated guidance feed sales to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2023. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% as compared to our previous guidance of 24% to 25% and the 19.6% full year GAAP tax rate for 2022.\nThe year-over-year increase is driven primarily by expectations for lower share-based compensation deductions, increased mix of his income in higher tax jurisdictions and higher tax and foreign income in 2023 compared to 2022. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $90 million, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year and assuming elevated sulfur rates throughout 2023.\nInterest expense is expected to moderate in the back half of the year of cash flows on our interest rate swaps become more favorable, and we paid down a portion of our outstanding revolver indebtedness. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is now forecast to be approximately $60 million compared to the previous guidance of $56 million to $58 million in 2023 due to the addition of refuse storage-related depreciation expense.\nGAAP intangible amortization expense expectations are unchanged and at approximately $100 million during the year. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, this add-back item should be reflected net of tax using the expected 25% tax rate. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year.\nOperating and free cash flow generation is expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2023. For the full year, we expect adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion to be strong at well over 100% as working capital levels moderate off of peak levels.\nOur full year weighted average diluted share count is still expected to decrease to approximately 63 million shares as compared to 64.7 million shares in 2022, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in 2022. Finally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong momentum in our commercial and industrial product categories during the quarter, but softer residential product sales resulted in consolidated net sales at the low end of our previous guidance range. Specifically, higher home standby field inventory levels continue to impact orders and shipments in the fourth quarter, and clean energy product shipments were lower as we work to further improve the reliability of these products and expand our distribution capabilities.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales decreased 2% to $1.05 billion and core sales declined 7% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 19% from the prior year, due to the previously mentioned home standby and clean energy product headwinds. C&I product sales increased 27% on a year-over-year basis, with robust core sales growth across all channels domestically and all regions internationally. Adjusted EBITDA margins declined during the quarter as the unfavorable effect of sales mix, reduced operating leverage and the increase in recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions, were partially offset by favorable price cost dynamics.\nFor the full year 2022, Generac achieved another year of record top line growth, with total net sales increasing 22% over 2021, which marked our third consecutive year of double-digit growth. While residential product shipments faced headwinds in the second half of 2022, the category still experienced strong year-over-year growth of approximately 19%. Additionally, sales of our C&I products have never been stronger, as global shipments grew 26% over the prior year, resulting in $1.26 billion in annual sales. We exited 2022 with record backlog for these products, setting our expectations for another strong year in 2023.\nIn addition to record net sales, our International segment achieved all-time highs in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the year as we continue to benefit from increasing global demand for backup power and mobile products. Also, our strong liquidity position allowed us to opportunistically repurchase more than 2.7 million shares during the year. Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide an update on the progress we made over the course of the year to advance our evolution into an energy technology solutions company and discuss the continued development of the powerful megatrends that are driving our business.\nDespite the softer second half of 2022 for our residential products, we continue to make important progress in building out our portfolio of energy technology-related solutions during the year. Importantly, we began assembling a significantly deeper and more experienced leadership team focused on improving and advancing our clean energy products and distribution capabilities while further integrating the multiple energy technology investments we've made in recent years. We also continue to develop and invest in numerous new technologies and capabilities, including taking a minority equity interest investment in WATT Fuel cell, acquiring Blue Pillar and launching our single pane of glass initiative.\nBlue Pillar's capabilities provide us with the foundation for connecting our growing portfolio of C&I-focused energy technology solutions, while our single pane of glass initiative is focused on developing the end user interface or central hub of our smart home energy ecosystem and heavily leverages ecobee's platform development expertise. We also brought multiple new solutions to market during the year as we began shipping our second-generation load control device called PWRmanager, launched a line of portable battery solutions called Portable Power Stations and announced new EV charging solutions for utilities and EV owners.\nOur grid services team also announced several additional project wins during 2022 and had a strong year across several key operating metrics. Additionally, the megatrends that drive the long-term growth trajectory of our business became even more evident in 2022. Extreme weather and multiple high-profile outage events further highlighted the poor reliability of the U.S. power grid, while war and geopolitical instability in Europe forced consumers and businesses to evaluate the importance of energy security.\nThe home is a sanctuary and aging in place trends that are helping drive demand for residential backup power solutions remain very compelling. A structural shift in consumer preferences and work habits in the U.S. in recent years has further increased sensitivity to power outages with the percentage of individuals working from home tripling and home health referral volumes doubling since 2019. As the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the policy backdrop for our energy technology solutions has never been more favorable, most notably with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing additional conviction for us to maintain a long-term focus with our investments in energy technology.\nAdditionally, increased federal infrastructure spending and the ongoing upgrade of global telecom networks help support our future growth expectations for our C&I products as well. The massive changes taking place with our nation's power grid are yet another megatrend that continues to strengthen as growing demand for electricity is met with less reliable supply. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, approximately 25% of Americans are at high risk of resource adequacy shortfalls during normal seasonal peak conditions in the 2023 to 2027 period due to the growing supply/demand imbalances across our power grid.\nWith the electrification of everything trends accelerating and the growing penetration of EVs, coupled with an increasingly higher mix of supply from intermittent renewable power generation sources, we believe this megatrend will drive a significant focus on the need for power resiliency for years to come. NERC's high-risk categorization comes before considering the notable increase in severe and volatile weather we've witnessed in recent years, which we believe only further magnifies the need for reliable decentralized energy technology solutions.\nNow discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail. Residential product sales declined at a double-digit rate as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower home standby shipments in the quarter resulting from higher field inventory levels. However, end market conditions continued to be strong during the quarter. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. was above the long-term average with Winter Storm Elliott and other larger localized outages providing yet another stark reminder of the fragility of our electrical infrastructure.\nThe extreme temperatures over the holiday season created a surge in demand for power for residential heating and coincided with supply disruptions as the nation's largest grid operator saw nearly 1/4 of its power plants fall offline resulting in rolling blackouts. This event took place in an especially inconvenient and sensitive time for many households, further supporting the continued increase in consumer awareness of the growing need for backup power solutions. Home consultations or sales leads in the quarter remained strong, matching the record high for a fourth quarter period in the prior year.\nAdditionally, home consultations for full year 2022 were more than 3x 2019 levels. This strength has continued early in 2023 with home consultations growing again on a year-over-year basis and reaching record levels for the month of January following the holiday season outage activity. We remain focused on expanding our distribution network as we experienced sequential growth in our residential dealer base and ended the quarter with more than 8,700 dealer partners, a net increase of approximately 200 dealers from the third quarter.\nActivations, which are a proxy for installations, grew at a robust rate in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and also grew sequentially as a result of increased installed bandwidth. In addition to this encouraging growth in activations and dealer count, we also experienced sequential improvement in close rates and dealer project lead times, although these 2 metrics are not yet back to normalized levels. The number of home standby generators and field inventory declined sequentially during the fourth quarter and are down more than 20% from peak levels, benefiting from reduced production rates and record activation levels in the quarter.\nDays of field inventory, which considers recent trends and activation rates, also declined sequentially during the fourth quarter. However, relative to historic seasonal patterns, days of field inventory are still well above normalized levels as of the end of 2022. We expect that field inventory levels will remain elevated through the first half of 2023, which will continue to weigh on orders and shipments of home standby generators during the first and second quarters.\nImproving the installation bandwidth for home standby generators is a key initiative for the company in 2023. We are focused on adding more dealers, providing support for dealer recruiting, training to improve installation efficiency and developing additional technical innovations to make it easier for contractors to install our products. Recent dealer count growth has been very encouraging as we added over 500 dealers in the second half of 2022.\nWe also rolled out our dealer talent network to help channel partners recruit qualified labor and are actively engaging with trade groups, such as the independent electrical contractors, to further drive awareness for the home standby generator category among contractors. Initiatives to help dealers streamline the installation process are also progressing well, including the launch of a universal permitting package that allows dealers to pull the necessary project documentation for their specific location.\nIn addition, we have further expanded our field training efforts and the sharing of installation best practices for dealers and nondealer contractors. The combination of these actions is expected to result in meaningful improvement in activation rates as the year progresses. Consistent with the comments provided on our third quarter earnings call in early November, we expect home standby sales to decline for the full year 2023 due to significant weakness in first half shipments resulting from elevated levels of field inventory with the first quarter expected to mark the trough for shipments during the current channel destocking process.\nWe continue to anticipate more normalized field inventory levels in the second half of the year based on our current view of home consultations, activations and our production rates, along with the assumption of power outage activity in line with the long-term baseline average. As we ramp home standby shipments sequentially into the second half of the year, we expect home standby sales to return to solid year-over-year growth in the third and fourth quarters, even when assuming no major outage events.\nFavorable end market demand metrics, significant growth in our dealer counts, low nationwide penetration in the mid-single digits and strengthening mega trends reinforce our confidence in the long-term growth trajectory for the home standby category and also support our near-term expectations for a return to growth once the home standby market reaches more normalized field inventory levels.\nI'd now like to provide some commentary on our residential energy technology products and solutions as sales were in line with the low end of our prior expectations during the fourth quarter, with continued softness in residential energy storage shipments, offset by strong top line performances from ecobee and Generac grid services. Shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems were again negatively impacted by the loss of a large customer that ceased operations in the third quarter and the overhang of the SnapRS quality-related concerns.\nWe are committed to supporting the dealers that are participating in our SnapRS warranty coverage upgrade program as well as ensuring that end customer systems are performing as intended. Channel partner response to these efforts has been favorable thus far, and we are working to build a larger and stronger network of installers and distributors, which remains a top priority for the company in 2023 as we position our residential clean energy product offering for long-term success.\nWe are investing heavily on further improving the quality and reliability of our clean energy products and view the residential storage market as a key strategic opportunity for Generac. Additionally, we're making good progress towards our next-generation energy storage system, and we'll begin alpha testing of these products in the second quarter of this year with an anticipated launch to the market in 2024.\nI'd now like to provide a quick update on ecobee, which forms the core of our connected devices strategy within our residential energy ecosystem. Ecobee sales continued to grow at a strong rate in the fourth quarter, despite aggressive promotional activity from competitors, which underscores the strong competitive positioning of ecobee's feature-rich solutions. In addition to their core smart thermostat product continuing to gain traction in the professional contractor channel, a number of larger utilities have been seeking out grid service partnerships with ecobee, further validating our differentiated offering.\nWe also recently announced the integration of home standby monitoring capabilities into the ecobee platform, which allows homeowners to monitor their home standby generator and propane tank fuel levels and receive alerts directly on the ecobee platform. This marks an important first step forward in our single pane of glass initiative in developing the central user interface for our suite of residential products that will heavily leverage the ecobee platform and the development team.\nI also want to provide some commentary on our grid services team and their efforts as they closed out a strong year in 2022 with continued growth across key performance metrics, including connected megawatts, assets under management, number of customers and gigawatt hours of capacity delivered. The growing grid services sales pipeline is being driven by both new and existing customers as well as a wide range of connectability hardware, including the Blue Pillar acquisition, which will now provide our C&I products with connectivity capabilities to allow previously stranded C&I assets to be made available to grid services programs.\nIn addition, grid services programs can also provide incremental economic support to the residential solar plus storage market as higher financing costs impact traditional consumer loan-driven demand. Not only can these programs improve the economics for homeowners that own storage systems but we are also seeing increased opportunities to deploy grid services programs utilizing utility and third-party-owned systems. We believe our unique portfolio of hardware and software solutions remains a key competitive advantage within the grid services space.\nThe long-term market opportunities for residential energy storage, power conversion, energy monitoring and management services and grid services remains highly attractive and core to our strategic vision, and we will continue to target these markets and adjacent opportunities. To that end, we recently announced the launch of our new EV charger, which marks Generac's initial offering into this large and rapidly growing market.\nThis product will be available later in 2023 through Generac's omnichannel distribution network, including our residential dealer network, leading home improvement in hardware retailers and electrical wholesalers. We're excited to incorporate this product into our Smart Home Energy ecosystem while continuing to pursue future EV charging innovations and capabilities. EV charging will become an increasingly important part of the energy ecosystem of the home. And as a leader in residential power, this product is a natural extension of Generac's portfolio of energy technology solutions.\nGiven these significant market opportunities, we continue to invest heavily in the people and processes involved in the development of these products and solutions, and this remains a key strategic area of focus for the company. We are encouraged by the progress of our new residential energy technology leadership team in integrating and improving the solutions we've acquired and developed in recent years. The investment level necessary to build a home energy technology foundation for growth will contribute to higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the company in 2023, but we anticipate strong returns on these investments well into the future as we position Generac as a leader in the deployment and integration of hardware and software solutions for home energy ecosystems.\nAs a result of these initiatives and investments, we expect the combination of residential energy technology products and services to deliver gross sales between $300 million and $350 million for the full year 2023. We anticipate that these results will sequentially improve throughout the year, driven by strong growth from ecobee and grid services, alongside our expectations for continued improvement from our clean energy product and distribution efforts in the coming quarters.\nSwitching gears, I will now want to provide some commentary on a part of the business that has continued to outperform our expectations, as our C&I products experienced an outstanding quarter globally as sales grew by 27% as compared to the prior year, benefiting from very strong demand and higher production levels resulting from capacity expansion initiatives.\nGrowth in shipments for domestic C&I products in the fourth quarter was highlighted by strength across all channels, including national rental equipment, telecom, industrial distributors and other strategic customers. We experienced continued strength in demand during the quarter as the backlog for our C&I products grew again sequentially and ended the year at record levels, giving us excellent visibility into continued growth for the category in 2023.\nShipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew significantly again in the fourth quarter. And order trends indicate growth will continue in 2023 as backlog in the channel also increased again on a sequential basis. Quoting activity and close rates remain elevated compared to the prior year levels, highlighting our sustained market share gains as well as the durability of overall demand trends for these products.\nShipments to national telecom customers also increased at a robust rate during the fourth quarter as compared to the strong prior year comparison as several of our larger national customers continue to deploy generators to harden their existing sites and build out their fifth generation or 5G networks. Investment in telecom infrastructure remains one of the key megatrends that we expect to drive growth for our C&I products in the coming years as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency.\nAs the leading provider of backup power to the North American telecom market, we expect to benefit from this secular trend. We also experienced another quarter of tremendous growth with our international and independent rental equipment customers as they refresh and expand their fleets. We believe the demand environment for mobile products will remain robust in the quarters ahead, as evidenced by order growth outpacing shipment growth in the quarter and the megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements continues to play out.\nAdditionally, we're helping these customers advance their sustainability goals with solid demand for our newly introduced mobile energy storage systems and as we delivered the first containerized hydrogen fuel cell unit to a national rental customer through our recently announced distribution agreement with EODev. Strong customer interest for natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects also continued in the quarter as shipments of these products grew at an exceptional rate.\nOrder rates also remained strong with our quarter end backlog for these products up substantially both year-over-year and sequentially. We believe we are in the very early innings of growth for this exciting new market opportunity as grid stability concerns in volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these innovative solutions. Internationally, robust momentum continued as shipments increased 22% year-over-year during the fourth quarter, with 28% core total sales growth when excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.\nCore total sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America, with intersegment sales again growing substantially in the quarter as our Generac Mexico facility continued to ramp production of telecom products for the North American market. International segment EBITDA margins also increased during the quarter, primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes.\nThe European region has seen remarkably strong demand, most notably for C&I products and portable generators, due to a heightened focus on energy independence and security. Power security concerns amid the war in Ukraine have remained, and we are providing backup generators to the region through our European sales branches. Although geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions in the region remain volatile, driving less certain long-term demand trends and market awareness of the need for resiliency is undoubtedly increased across the continent.\nThe subsequent effect of the war on Europe's energy complex has highlighted the need for reliable on-site power resources for homes and businesses around the globe. We also recently announced the acquisition of REFU Storage Systems, a German developer and supplier of battery storage hardware products, advanced software and platform services for the commercial and industrial market. This acquisition represents our initial entrance into the large and rapidly growing C&I stationary energy storage market for behind-the-meter applications, which we view as a natural extension of our long history in the C&I backup power generation market.\nGiven the continued momentum in the International segment, along with strong demand fundamentals and existing backlog across domestic C&I channels, we expect net sales growth for our global C&I products to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for 2023. In closing this morning, we are encouraged by the initial progress in our action plans to address the near-term challenges that have impacted our results over the past 2 quarters. We believe we have a line of sight to normalization of home standby field inventories as we right size our production and continue to expand our installation bandwidth.\nWe have significantly strengthened our residential energy technology leadership team over the last 6 months, and they are driving an increased focus on quality and innovation while we further build out our product and distribution capabilities in this strategically important part of our business. Global interest in our C&I products and services has never been stronger and is well positioned to continue growing in 2023. We remain confident in the long-term strategic growth teams within our business, including the still significant penetration opportunity for home standby generators and the rapidly developing market for energy storage.\nThe previously discussed megatrends that support these growth themes have never been more evident. Our refined focus on execution through our portfolio of backup power and energy technology solutions has uniquely positioned us to create value in the transition to the next-generation grid. I'm extremely confident in our team's ability to continue developing innovative products and services as we execute on our mission to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions. I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter as well as full year 2022 results and our outlook for 2023. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter 2022 results in more detail. Net sales decreased 2% to $1.05 billion during the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $1.07 billion in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 5% favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2022 increased 22% to approximately $4.56 billion, an all-time record for the company.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales declined 19% to $575 million as compared to $706 million in the prior year. A partial quarter of contribution from the ecobee acquisition and the slight unfavorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 4% of revenue growth for the quarter on a net basis. Lower shipments of home standby generators and weakness in PWRcell energy storage systems drove the decline in residential product core sales growth.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 27% to $361 million as compared to $284 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the electronic environments and Blue Pillar acquisitions were fully offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency during the quarter. The very strong core sales growth was broad-based across all regions internationally and all channels domestically, with particular strength in national rental equipment, telecom, industrial distributors and other direct customers for beyond standby applications.\nNet sales for other products and services increased 46% to $113 million as compared to $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Contributions from the Electronic Environments and ecobee acquisitions contributed approximately 34% of this growth, given their additional service capabilities. Core sales growth for the category was 13% due to strong growth in our services offerings in certain parts of our business, both domestically and internationally, along with continued growth in aftermarket service parts and extended warranty revenue recognition.\nGross profit margin was 32.7% compared to 34.0% in the prior year fourth quarter as unfavorable sales mix had a meaningful negative impact during the quarter. This was partially offset by the realization of previously implemented pricing actions. Operating expenses increased $49 million or 26% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions and unfavorable adjustment for acquisition contingent consideration, certain legal and regulatory reserves, higher intangible amortization expense and increased employee and marketing costs.\nThese increases were partially offset by lower acquisition-related transaction costs in the current year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $174 million or 16.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to $220 million or 20.7% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $825 million or an 18.1% margin as compared to $861 million or 23.1% margin in the prior year.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 3% to $881 million in the quarter as compared to $909 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 7% revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $144 million, representing a 16.4% margin as compared to $197 million in the prior year or 21.6% of total sales.\nThe lower Domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by the realization of previously implemented pricing actions. In addition, the impact of acquisitions and continued energy technology operating expense investments for future growth negatively affected margins during the quarter. For the full year 2022, Domestic segment total sales increased 23% over the prior year to $3.93 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 18.2% compared to 24.8% in the prior year full year.\nInternational segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 22% to $219 million in the quarter as compared to $180 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 28% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $29.5 million or 13.5% of net sales as compared to $23.7 million or 13.1% of net sales in the prior year. This margin performance was driven primarily by improved operating leverage on the higher volumes.\nFor the full year 2022, International segment total sales increased 32% over the prior year to $791 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests were 13.8% of total sales during 2022, a significant 280 basis point increase compared to the 11% margin in the prior year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of '22 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $71 million as compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The current year net income includes pretax charges totaling approximately $21 million related to an unfavorable adjustment for acquisition contingent consideration and certain legal and regulatory reserves.\nIn addition, interest expense increased approximately $10 million compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and higher interest rates. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $13.6 million or an effective tax rate of 15.5% as compared to $20.6 million or an effective tax rate of 12.4% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was due to certain favorable discrete items that were reflected in the prior year, which did not repeat in the current year quarter.\nDiluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.83 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $2.04 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $113 million in the current year quarter or $1.78 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $160 million in the prior year or $2.51 per share. Cash flow from operations was $101 million as compared to $62 million in the prior year fourth quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $80 million as compared to $42 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to lower working capital investment in the current year quarter as we reduced our material receipts and production rates for home standby generators. This was partially offset by lower operating earnings. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.29 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $133 million of cash on hand and $1.16 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.43 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 1.8x on an as-reported basis.\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $222 million or an average price of approximately $102 per share. There is approximately $278 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of 2022. With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we're initiating 2023 net sales guidance that is consistent with the high-level comments provided in our third quarter earnings call on November 2.\nAs Aaron previously discussed, shipments of residential products are expected to face significant headwinds in the first half of the year due to elevated field inventory levels for home standby generators and the continued build-out of our clean energy product and distribution capabilities. We expect the residential product category to return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half, resulting in a full year decline in the high teens range compared to prior year.\nWe anticipate continued growth for C&I product sales across several channels domestically and internationally, resulting in expected C&I net sales growth in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year, with higher growth rates anticipated in the first half of the year. As a result of these factors, we expect overall net sales for the full year to decrease between minus 6% to minus 10% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 1% of net favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency.\nImportantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. As a result and consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a Category 3 or higher landed hurricane or major winter storm. As a result of this top line outlook, we expect sales to be more weighted to the back half of the year for 2023, similar to pre-COVID periods, which did not include substantial residential backlog, with overall net sales in the first half being approximately 44% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 56% weighted.\nSpecifically, with the return to normal seasonality and the destocking of Home Standby field inventory, we expect first quarter total sales to decline by approximately minus 25% to minus 26% from the prior year, with growth in C&I product sales more than offset by residential product headwinds. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2023 compared to 2022, we expect favorable price cost impacts driven by previously implemented pricing actions that have not yet fully annualized, certain cost reduction initiatives and lower input costs to more than offset the negative impact of unfavorable sales mix resulting from lower home standby generator shipments.\nAs a result, we expect gross margins for the full year to increase by approximately 150 basis points as compared to 2022. From a seasonality perspective, we expect first quarter gross margins to be the lowest during the year, due primarily to the outsized impact of unfavorable sales mix and lower overhead absorption on the lower home standby volumes. Specifically for the first quarter, we expect gross margins to be approximately 200 basis points below the first quarter of 2022.\nSequential quarterly improvements in gross margins are expected as the year progresses, due to improved sales mix from higher shipments of home standby generators, along with lower input costs, improved overhead absorption and realization of cost reduction initiatives as we move throughout the year, And as a result, gross margins are expected to progressively improve with fourth quarter margins to be approximately 500 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn addition, we continue to focus heavily on supporting innovation, executing on strategic initiatives and driving future revenue growth in new and existing markets. As a result of these continued investments, we expect operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization expense as a percentage of net sales to be nearly 20% for the full year of 2023, with operating leverage improving throughout the year.\nAs a result of our gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be approximately 17% to 18% for the full year compared to the 18.1% reported for the full year 2022. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly as we move throughout the year, primarily driven by the sequentially improving gross margins as previously discussed in detail and to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on the expected higher sales volumes in the second half of 2023.\nSpecifically regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be the lowest for the year at approximately 10% and then improved sequentially throughout the year, returning to more normalized levels in the low 20% range in the fourth quarter. As a result, second half adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 800 basis points higher than the first half margins. As is normal practice, we are also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2023. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% to 25% as compared to the 19.6% full year GAAP tax rate for 2022. This increase is driven primarily by expectations for lower share-based compensation deductions, increased mix of income in higher tax jurisdictions and higher tax on foreign income in 2023 compared to 2022.\nAdditionally, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, the related reconciling item should be forecasted net of tax using this GAAP tax rate as well. We expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year and assuming elevated SOFR rates throughout 2023. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year in line with historical levels.\nDepreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $56 million to $58 million in 2023, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2023 is expected to be approximately $100 million during the year. And stock compensation expense is expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2023.\nSpecifically related to the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be negative, assuming a continued use of cash for working capital with a sharp recovery in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion to be strong at well over 100% as recent trends of significant working capital builds are reversed. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to decrease to approximately 63 million shares as compared to 64.7 million shares in 2022, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in 2022.\nFinally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open the call for questions."

Jagdfeld\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was in line with the preliminary results we announced on October 19. Momentum in the commercial and industrial product category remains strong, but residential product sales, while still growing compared with the prior year, were weaker than expected in the quarter, driven by lower shipments of home standby generators and clean energy products relative to our prior expectations.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales increased 15% to $1.09 billion, primarily driven by core sales growth of 10%, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency. Overall, residential product sales grew 9% during the quarter, led by sales of home standby generators and the impact from recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems.\nC&I product sales increased 20%, led by growth across all channels domestically, strength in the European region and the contribution from recent acquisitions.\nNow discussing our third quarter results in more detail. Home standby generator sales grew at a mid-teens rate over the prior year. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. during the quarter remained above the long-term baseline average and Hurricane Ian, which occurred in the last week of the quarter, drove total power outage activity well above the long-term average.\nHome consultations or sales leads were lower in the quarter when compared to the prior year, which included Hurricane Ida. However, the third quarter of 2022 was tied for the second highest total for any given quarter since we began tracking the metric in 2013. And we experienced a return to year-over-year growth in the month of October resulting from Hurricane Ian.\nWe continue to focus on expanding our distribution network as we experienced sequential growth in our residential dealer base and ended the quarter with nearly 8,500 dealer partners, a net increase of approximately 300 dealers sequentially.\nActivations, which are a proxy for installs, continued to grow in the third quarter compared to the prior year. However, as we mentioned in our preliminary announcement, installation capacity for home standby generators lagged our production output. The ability of installing contractors to fully service the demand for backup power from homeowners continues to be constrained by labor availability, permitting and utility-related delays and shortages in certain materials needed to complete an installation.\nFurthermore, growth in our dealer base was constrained in prior quarters by our extended production lead times. All of this resulted in elevated levels of field inventory and lower-than-expected orders from our channel partners despite the continued strength in end customer demand.\nImportantly, to address these activation challenges, we're working on a number of specific initiatives to increase home standby installation bandwidth, such as providing resources to help existing dealers expand their labor forces and additional installation training locally for non-dealer contractors. We are working to streamline home standby projects by creating universal permitting packages and replicating past successes and simplifying approval processes from certain local utilities.\nOther efficiency-related initiatives include dealer scheduling and quotation refinement to enhance the top of the sales funnel and optimize the allocation of sales leads within the dealer channel to favor those dealers that have capacity to install more generators. Importantly, we have also intensified efforts to further expand our overall dealer count, and we expect another strong quarter of sequential growth in the fourth quarter.\nOur dealer count growth initiatives have recently benefited from our shorter production lead times, which have now mostly returned to normal levels as we ramped our production output of home standby generators in prior quarters.\nAlthough installation capacity constraints have resulted in lower orders from our channel partners, it is important to reiterate that underlying demand and market fundamentals of the home standby category remains strong as supported by meaningfully sequential improvements in a number of key dealer-related metrics during the third quarter. In-home consultations grew, close rates continue to rebound, and while still elevated, the time between contract signing and installation declined meaningfully as compared to the second quarter.\nDealer productivity, as measured by activations per day per dealer, improved to an all-time high during the third quarter. In addition, our dealer survey data suggests approximately half of all the field inventory is allocated to an active customer contract, highlighting the need to further increase the pace of installs to close the gap between strong end customer demand and installation capacity.\nWhile the previously mentioned sequential improvements provide evidence that our channel partners are beginning to make progress in working through their elevated backlogs and field inventory, we expect home standby order headwinds to persist through the first half of 2023 as field inventory levels normalize. Even when assuming no major outage events, in the second half of 2023, we expect significant sequential sales growth from the first half of the year and only a modest decline in sales on a year-over-year basis as we maintain a new and higher baseline level of demand.\nOver the last 30 years, the home standby category has grown in a step function pattern as penetration rates have expanded rapidly for several years at a time, driven by notable major power outage events, followed by periods of flatter growth as demand normalizes. With each successive growth period comes increased awareness around home standby generators and increased distribution for these products, both of which have been critical in helping the category reach new and higher levels of baseline demand.\nThe latest growth step that the product category has experienced was underpinned by an increase in power outage activity over the past several years, with 4 of the top 10 major outage events since 2010 having occurred in just the last 2 years alone. This growth can be evidenced through a number of key market metrics in comparing the first 3 quarters of 2022 to the comparable period of 2019 as activations per day more than doubled, home consultations more than tripled and our dealer count increased by nearly 40% from 6,200 to 8,500.\nThe approximate mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in the category over the past several decades can be tied to the increase in power outages over that time as the nation's electrical grid has struggled to reliably supply power to homeowners and businesses. The aging and under-invested grid infrastructure has become more vulnerable to the increasing severity of high-impact weather-related events, such as hurricanes, heat waves, tornadoes, ice storms and polar vortexes.\nAdditionally, new mega trends have emerged that we believe will drive the next step of growth in the category. Grid resiliency concerns have been increasing as decarbonization trends accelerate, causing a widening gap between supply and demand, leaving many utilities and grid operators scrambling to avoid rolling blackouts over the past several years. And we believe little has been done to rectify this situation.\nWe also believe the home as a sanctuary megatrend will persist as the shift to remote or hybrid work remains intact. The electrification of homes continues to grow and demographic trends are driving increased levels of aging in place. With the nationwide penetration rate still in the mid-single-digit range, and these megatrends firmly intact, we are confident that the long-term growth trajectory for the home standby category remains significant.\nI'd now like to discuss our residential clean energy products as shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the significant liquidity challenges of a large customer that ceased operations and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to address certain warranty-related matters for the upgrade of a component within our PWRcell energy storage system. As part of this effort, we have engaged a number of third-party service companies to assist with the completion of these upgrades, and these efforts are well underway.\nAs a result of these items, we recorded a $55 million charge in the quarter, comprised of an $18 million bad debt reserve and a $37 million warranty charge. The challenges we experienced in our clean energy business in the third quarter were very disappointing, but we believe that the solar-plus energy storage market continues to represent an important strategic opportunity for Generac longer term.\nHowever, this quarter's results have demonstrated the need for us to further expand our distribution by focusing our efforts on partnering with high-quality, reputable sales and installation companies for these products. Importantly, we are committed to supporting the dealers that are participating in our warranty coverage upgrade program as they play a vital role in restoring our competitive position in the residential clean energy space.\nIn addition, we continue to broaden our product offering and bring new innovations to this market as we announced an update to the PWRcell energy storage system during the quarter that enables AC-coupled battery storage, as well as AC generator integration.\nWork also continues on our PV microinverter product called the PWRmicro, as our beta testing began late in the second quarter and will continue through the balance of this year. We anticipate a phased commercial rollout beginning in the first half of 2023 and a full commercial launch targeted for the second half of the year.\nI'd now like to provide a quick update on our ecobee acquisition, which we completed last December. During the initial period of our ownership, we have been focused on developing cross-selling opportunities for ecobee's hardware solutions through Generac's distribution partners, and have seen positive indications of demand for smart thermostats alongside other clean energy products.\nSynergies between ecobee and Generac's grid services teams continues to be validated, and we are identifying higher potential value creation for ecobee devices and demand response programs amid ongoing concerns around grid stability and rising energy prices.\nWe have also begun leveraging the talented ecobee team to help accelerate our connected devices strategy, which is core to the development of our residential energy ecosystem that will ultimately be accessed and controlled by a single pane glass user interface.\nI also want to provide some additional color on the efforts of our grid services team as they continue to execute on a growing and diversified sales pipeline. We have further expanded our efforts to extract synergies across our commercial teams as they work to offer an increasing mix of Generac hardware alongside our Concerto grid services software platform. Our comprehensive suite of solutions aimed at distributed energy resource management-related programs is unmatched and is proving to be a competitive differentiator for our grid services team as the number of devices and megawatts of capacity connected to the Concerto platform continues to grow.\nWe announced a number of program wins since our second quarter call, including Software-as-a-Service contracts with Dominion Energy and U.K.-based Pearlstone Energy, as well as a performance contract with Arizona Public Service, which demonstrates Generac's unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions in grid services programs.\nThe long-term market opportunities for residential energy storage, microinverters, monitoring and management devices and grid services solutions remains highly attractive and core to our strategic vision. However, the loss of a major customer during the quarter, along with the specific warranty-related issue, has impacted near-term demand and our outlook for the full year 2022. We now expect the combination of clean energy technology products and services to deliver sales between $300 million to $330 million for the full year 2022 as compared to our previous guidance of approximately $500 million.\nOur continued investment in the people and processes involved in the development of these products remains a key focal area for the company, as we work to further broaden our product offering, while also improving the quality and performance of the technologies we've acquired and developed over the last 3 years. With that in mind, we're building a talented and focused clean energy technology management team, beginning with the addition of Norm Taffe in August as our new President of this organization, along with the new Chief Technology Officer, Senior Vice President of Finance and a Senior Vice President of Policy. Norm and his team bring decades of industry leadership experience, as well as robust technical expertise that will help drive Generac's integrated clean energy technology solutions forward.\nAdditionally, the policy backdrop for this market has never been more favorable with the Inflation Reduction Act providing the necessary visibility for long-term value-creating investments. We will continue to build out our energy technology leadership team and our suite of products and solutions as we expect to play an important role in the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable electric grid.\nAs a result of these investments and the strong outlook for this market, we expect clean energy technology sales to return to strong growth for the full year 2023, with sequentially improving results throughout the year.\nOur C&I products continue to perform exceptionally well in the quarter, as global C&I net sales increased 20% on an as-reported basis and 23% on a core sales basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and foreign currency as compared to the prior year. Both in-shipments for domestic C&I products in the third quarter was led by strength across national rental equipment, telecom and industrial distributor customers.\nWe experienced continued strength in demand during the quarter as backlog for our C&I products remained at record levels, and expanded further in the month of October, giving us excellent visibility that solid growth will continue in the category well into 2023.\nShipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew significantly again in the third quarter, and order trends indicate this momentum will continue in the quarters ahead as backlog in the channel increased on a sequential basis. Quoting activity and close rates remain elevated compared to prior year levels, highlighting our market share gains, as well as the durability of demand trends for backup power for C&I applications.\nShipments to national telecom customers also increased again during the third quarter as compared to the prior year, as several of our larger national customers continue to invest in hardening their existing sites and the build-out of their fifth generation or 5G networks. These networks are increasingly considered as part of the nation's critical infrastructure, and require backup power for resiliency. Upgrades to telecom infrastructure remain one of the key megatrends that we expect to drive growth for our business in the coming years as global tower and network hub counts continue to expand.\nWe also experienced another quarter of substantial growth with our national and independent rental equipment customers as they continue to invest in equipment to refresh and expand their fleets. We anticipate the demand environment for mobile products will remain robust in the quarters ahead as the mega trend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements continues to play out.\nStrong customer interest for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects also continued in the quarter, with sales of these products growing at an exceptional rate. We believe we are in the very early innings of growth for this exciting new market opportunity, as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these innovative solutions.\nWe also took a significant step forward in our C&I generator connectivity efforts shortly after quarter end with the acquisition of Blue Pillar, an industrial Internet of Things platform developer that enables distributed energy generation monitoring and control. Blue Pillar's connectivity solutions can make previously stranded C&I backup generators available for using grid services programs by connection to the Concerto software platform, and will provide a foundation for our longer-term vision of creating a single user interface for a suite of connected C&I assets.\nOur International segment continued to experience very strong momentum, as total sales increased 14% year-over-year during the third quarter, with 22% core total sales growth when excluding the benefit of acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Core total sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America, with intersegment sales also growing substantially in the quarter as our Generac Mexico facility further ramps production of telecom products for the North American market.\nThe European region has seen remarkably strong demand across product lines, most notably in C&I and portable generators due to a heightened focus on energy independence and security.\nConcerns over power security amid the conflict in Ukraine have continued to rise, and we are providing backup generators to the region through our European sales branches. Longer-term demand trends are less certain, however, as geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions in the region remain volatile, but end market awareness of the need for resiliency has increased across the continent in recent quarters. The subsequent effect of the war on Europe's energy complex has highlighted the dependence on continuous power sources for homes and businesses around the globe.\nLooking into 2023 for our global C&I products, given the strong demand fundamentals and existing backlog, our preliminary view anticipates continued strong year-over-year growth throughout the entire year.\nIn closing, this morning, we were disappointed that our third quarter results were below our prior expectations. But we believe we have action plans in place to address the underlying challenges in the business. New clean energy technology leadership has brought an increased emphasis on quality and innovation, and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity for this strategic area of our business.\nImportant initiatives to help ease home standby installation bottlenecks are well underway. And as the home standby market normalizes, we are confident that the new and higher baseline of end demand for the product category will become clearer. Hurricane Ian is the latest example of increasingly severe and more volatile weather patterns, and we believe the power grid's growing supply and demand imbalance is far from resolved, as we add intermittent renewable generation sources, while simultaneously pursuing the electrification of our homes, our businesses and our transportation.\nThe secular growth themes and megatrends supporting the company's Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy remain firmly intact, and as reliance on electricity around the world grows further, we will continue to invest in innovative products and solutions to lead the evolution to the next generation grid.\nI now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our third quarter 2022 results, our outlook for the year and our preliminary views on 2023. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2022 results in more detail, net sales increased 15% to $1.09 billion during the third quarter of 2022 as compared to $943 million in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 5% net impact on revenue growth during the quarter.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class. Residential product sales grew to $664 million as compared to $609 million in the prior year, representing a 9% increase over a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from the ecobee acquisition and the slight unfavorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 5% of revenue growth for the quarter.\nHome standby generator sales made up the majority of the residential product core sales growth, increasing at a solid mid-teens rate over the prior year. This was partially offset by weakness in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems.\nCommercial and industrial product sales for the third quarter of 2022 increased 20% to $311 million as compared to $258 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency provided a net headwind of more than 2% to net sales growth during the quarter.\nThe strong core net sales growth was broad-based across most regions, internationally and across all channels domestically with particular strength in national rental equipment, telecom, industrial distributor and energy management channels.\nNet sales for the other products and services category increased 49% to $113 million as compared to $76 million in the third quarter of 2021. Core sales growth for the category was 17% due to strength in aftermarket service parts and extended warranty revenue recognition, along with strong growth in our services offerings in certain parts of our business, both domestically and internationally.\nGross profit margin was 33.2% compared to 35.6% in the prior year third quarter as we continue to experience modest price cost headwinds during the quarter from a margin percent standpoint. In addition, recent acquisitions and a less favorable sales mix, primarily driven by a lower proportion of home standby product sales, also negatively impacted margins in the current year quarter.\nOperating expenses increased $111 million or 68% as compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase includes $55.3 million of pretax charges comprised of $17.9 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that is filed for bankruptcy and a $37.3 million charge for clean energy product warranty-related matters. The remaining increase was primarily driven by higher recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions and an increase in intangible amortization expense. To a lesser extent, higher employee costs and higher marketing spend also contributed to the increase.\nAdjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $184 million or 16.9% of net sales in the third quarter as compared to $209 million or 22.2% of net sales in the prior year.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 18% to $947 million in the quarter, as compared to $802 million in the prior year with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 8% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $160 million, representing a 16.9% margin as compared to $188 million in the prior year or 23.4% of net sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to continued price cost headwinds.\nIn addition, continued operating expense investments for future growth and the impact of acquisitions had an unfavorable effect on margins during the quarter, as operating expenses as a percentage of sales came in higher than expected on the lower shipment volumes relative to expectations.\nInternational segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 14% to $183 million in the quarter as compared to $160 million in the prior year quarter. Core total sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 22% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests was $24 million or 13.2% of net sales as compared to $21.5 million or 13.4% of net sales in the prior year. This margin performance was impacted by a higher mix of lower-margin intersegment sales, which was mostly offset by favorable operating leverage on significantly higher volumes.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2022 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $58 million as compared to $132 million for the third quarter of 2021. The current year net income includes the pretax charges totaling $55.3 million related to the clean energy bad debt and warranty-related matters.\nGAAP income taxes during the quarter -- GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter was $11.6 million or an effective tax rate of 16.1% as compared to $32.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% for the prior year. The reduction was due to multiple discrete tax items that drove the tax rate down versus prior year on a net basis.\nDiluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.83 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.93 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $112 million in the current year quarter or $1.75 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $151 million in the prior year or $2.35 per share.\nCash flow from operations was negative $56 million as compared to positive $74 million in the prior year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release was negative $73 million as compared to positive $42 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was primarily due to lower operating earnings, increased tax payments and higher working capital levels in the current year quarter, partially offset by lower capital expenditures.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have approximately $1.48 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $230 million of cash on hand and $1.25 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.36 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter of 1.6x on an as-reported basis.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter, we repurchased 536,600 shares of our common stock for $123.9 million, which exhausted our previously existing stock repurchase program. In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to 500 million of our common stock over a 24-month period.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook. As previously disclosed 2 weeks ago within our pre-release, we updated our net sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2022. In line with the pre-release, we still expect net sales in 2022 to increase between 22% to 24% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 5% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes sales of residential and C&I products both increased at a similar rate in the low to mid-20% range during 2022 over the prior year.\nAlso in line with our pre-release, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are still expected to be approximately 18% to 19%. This EBITDA margin expectation reflects a modest sequential improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter levels, with higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales, partially offsetting the sequential gross margin improvement.\nNow I'd like to provide some further comments regarding our initial framework for net sales growth in 2023. Summarizing Aaron's earlier remarks, our preliminary view for 2023 anticipates that the first half of the year will experience year-over-year weakness on a consolidated basis. We expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, resulting in overall net sales to only decline modestly for the full year 2023 as compared to 2022.\nAgain, as Aaron previously discussed, home standby generator sales growth is expected to face significant headwinds in the first half of 2023. But as field inventories normalize, we anticipate strong sequential sales growth and a much more modest decline in sales growth over the prior year in the second half of 2023.\nClean energy technology is expected to experience robust sales growth for the full year as we continue to expand our presence, build out our distribution and launch new products into this market, resulting in sequentially improving results during 2023. Our preliminary view for 2023 C&I product sales growth anticipates continued strong growth throughout the year. This preliminary guidance assumes power outage activity that is in line with the long-term baseline average, and does not assume a prolonged recessionary environment that meaningfully impacts consumer spending during 2023.\nAdditionally, this is a preliminary early look into our 2023 forecast, and we will provide a more detailed update when we report fourth quarter results in mid-February of next year.\nShifting back to 2022, we will now provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2022. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 24.5% for the fourth quarter of the year, resulting in a full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%. For full year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $53 million to $55 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $52 million to $54 million, reflecting higher than previously expected benchmark interest rates. This assumes no additional changes in outstanding debt for the remainder of the year.\nDepreciation expense is still expected to be approximately $54 million to $56 million in 2022. GAAP intangible amortization expense in '22 is still expected to be approximately $100 million to $105 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $32 million and $34 million for the year.\nOur full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately 64.5 million shares compared to the previous guidance of 65 million to 65.5 million shares. Our capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately 2% to 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year compared to prior guidance of approximately 2.5% to 3% of net sales.\nFree cash flow conversion is expected to be closer to 100% of adjusted net income in the fourth quarter as the investment in working capital begins to level off. Finally, this updated 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Generac Holdings Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mike Harris, Senior VP, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael W. Harris\n\nVP of Corporate Development & IR, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.

Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were very strong with robust revenue growth, significant sequential margin expansion and all-time records in net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Shipments of home standby generators and global C&I products outperformed our previous expectations, primarily driven by continued progress on our capacity expansion and our team's ability to effectively manage the challenging supply chain environment.\nGrowth in adjusted EBITDA margins were also ahead of our expectations in the quarter, reinforcing our prior forecast of margins bottoming in the first quarter. Gross margins benefited from favorable product mix, largely driven by home standby generators. These dynamics drove adjusted EBITDA margin outperformance and sequential margin expansion, combined with impressive top line growth, resulted in an all-time quarterly record for adjusted EBITDA dollars.\nPositive underlying demand trends led to continued backlog strength with C&I products and home standby backlog, both providing us with considerable visibility for the quarters ahead. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 40% to $1.29 billion and grew sequentially from the first quarter of 2022, which was the previous all-time record. Strong momentum in core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, continued in the quarter with 33% growth over the prior year.\nOverall, residential sales growth was again very robust, driven by a substantial increase in shipments of home standby generators as well as the impact from recent acquisitions. The C&I sales increase was broad-based, led by growth across all channels domestically, all regions internationally and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded sequentially from 17.3% in the first quarter to 21% due to improved price realization and the moderation of input costs.\nImportantly, we expect growing realization of previously announced price increases in the second half of the year, further execution on cost reduction projects and continued easing of input cost headwinds resulting in sequentially improving margins over the remainder of the year.\nNow discussing our second quarter results in more detail. Shipments of home standby generators grew at an exceptionally strong rate over the prior year. Growth also accelerated sequentially from the first quarter as we continued to expand production and power outage activity in the U.S. as measured on a rolling 4-quarter basis at the end of the second quarter remained above the long-term baseline average. In addition to elevated baseline outage activity in the U.S., severe storms left more than 1 million utility customers without power in Ontario and Quebec in May, which resulted in robust leading indicators of demand in Canada as well.\nPower grid stresses are expected to persist, with forecasts for the upcoming hurricane season pointing to another year of above-average activity and multiple grid operators warning of potential outages as a result of excessive demand coinciding with supply challenges. Home consultations or sales leads continue to point to strong underlying demand for home standby generators, growing at a mid-teens rate despite a prior -- a strong prior year comparable period driven by the Texas winter storm event in February of 2021. This demand was broad-based, with 4 or 5 regions experiencing year-over-year growth in home consultations in the quarter.\nTo frame just how much home standby baseline demand has grown over the last several years, second quarter home consultations were more than 4x greater than pre-COVID levels seen in the second quarter of 2019. Importantly, strength in this leading market indicator has continued here in the month of July. In addition, activations, which are a proxy for installs, continued to grow at a solid rate in the second quarter compared to the prior year, led by the South Central and Midwest regions as we further added to our residential dealer base as we ended the quarter with approximately 8,200 dealer partners.\nWe continue to make excellent progress increasing our production levels for home standby generators, with daily build rates dramatically higher as compared to prior year levels and ramping sequentially as our Trenton, South Carolina facility continues to expand capacity. As we have increased build rates, lead times have continued to improve, and we are getting product in the hands of our customers and channel partners in a more consistent and a more timely basis.\nAs a result of this progress, close rates on our sales leads have begun to improve, supporting our belief that reducing our lead times will improve our ability to capture more of the new and higher baseline of home consultations or sales leads within our sales pipeline. Our build rates and supply chain challenges have been the main growth constraint for the home standby category over the last few years. We have now ramped production capacity to the point that our lead times for the product category have materially improved.\nHowever, the constraint has now shifted to the installation capacity of our dealer base, driven primarily by contractor labor availability, permitting and utility-related delays and shortages in certain materials needed to complete an installation. As a result, project lead times for homeowners, as measured by the time between the signed contract and the installation date, have not come down in proportion with our production lead times.\nWe have a number of initiatives focused on increasing installation bandwidth in the market, including aggressive campaigns to add new dealers to our network, cultivate and train non-dealer contractors on home standby installations and decrease the overall time associated with the project. Additionally, as housing construction activity begins to slow, we believe we have a greater ability to focus installing contractors on improving the pace of home standby installations.\nI'd now like to discuss our increasingly diverse suite of clean energy products and solutions. With the closing and integration of the ecobee acquisition, and given the growing commercial sales synergies and cross-functional initiatives between residential energy storage and microinverters, monitoring and management devices and grid services solutions, we now have one of the broadest portfolios of clean energy products and solutions in the industry.\nNet sales from these combined clean energy products grew well over 50% on an as-reported basis in the second quarter over the prior year. Macroeconomic uncertainty, input cost pressures, industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges and lack of clarity around regulatory policy have impacted residential clean energy markets as of late. But rising prices for traditional energy sources and a growing focus on energy independence and security have the potential to more than offset these concerns and continue to drive adoption of alternative and emerging solutions over time.\nAdditionally, we're very encouraged by last week's announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act as a potential positive catalyst for demand, although it's still not fully through the legislative process. As we work to capture this demand, our residential clean energy installer network continues to grow as we ended the second quarter with approximately 2,800 trained and certified technicians, with approximately 1,150 registered dealers on our PowerPlay sales platform.\nWe remain excited about the new and innovative products we're bringing to market in 2022, including the recent product launch of PWRmanager and the pending launches of our PWRgenerator, which is the industry's only engine-driven battery charger, an AC coupling solution for our PWRcell storage product for use in retrofit applications and our new PV microinverter product called the PWRmicro. As expected, we began shipping PWRmicros for beta testing in June and are now working to expand beta testing with full commercial launch expected in the fourth quarter.\nI'd now like to provide a quick update on ecobee. Integration is proceeding as planned, and we continue to make good progress in developing cross-selling opportunities for ecobee's hardware solutions through Generac's distribution partners. The ecobee team successfully launched 2 new thermostats with industry-leading features during the quarter. And high temperatures and rising energy costs across North America are driving increased interest in the smart thermostat category. Early reception on these new products has been encouraging, reinforcing ecobee's differentiated competitive position ,focused on intelligent, intuitive, feature-rich devices that maintain comfort while unlocking significant value creation and energy conservation for homeowners and grid operators.\nThis differentiation also drives significant market opportunity for ecobee's energy services offering, which has been further enhanced by synergies with Generac's grid services efforts. ecobee's installed base of more than 2 million connected homes is particularly valuable to grid operators seeking load flexibility and resilience. Consumer awareness of elevated energy market volatility is also driving potential growth for recurring services revenue as ecobee enables consumers to take advantage of variable rate pricing structures.\nAdditionally, we are beginning to leverage the amazing talent within the ecobee team to help accelerate the development of our residential energy ecosystem, a key element of our connected devices strategy.\nNow expanding a bit more on Generac Grid Services, the team continues to drive momentum in its increasingly impressive and diverse sales pipeline, building on the recent success across software-as-a-service, turnkey and performance contracts as well as experiencing an increasing mix of hardware sales, which are proving to be a competitive differentiator for our Grid Services business.\nFrom distributed generation and storage to load flexibility assets, our grid services suite of solutions is unmatched in the market. We announced a number of recent contract wins since our first quarter call that highlighted our expanding capabilities, including EV charging, monitoring and optimization, a turnkey program for low- and moderate-income households utilizing PWRcell energy storage systems and a unique solution for the German power market.\nUtilities and grid operators continue to warn of potentially significant disruptions to the power grid as a result of supply/demand imbalances, underscoring the need for new technologies to decentralize and digitize the power grid through the development of virtual power plants or VPPs. As an example, this need was on full display during the recent heatwave in Texas, as a number of home standby generators enrolled in the VPP program were autonomously controlled by our Concerto software platform to take demand off the grid and help keep critical community resources online.\nThe market opportunity for residential energy storage and microinverters, monitoring and management devices and grid services solutions remains extremely compelling and we believe will prove to be a key long-term future growth driver for Generac. For the full year 2022, we expect net sales of these clean energy products and solutions to approximately double from the prior year to more than $500 million in sales, with strong core and inorganic growth contributions and an even larger opportunity in the years ahead.\nNow let me make some comments on our C&I products, which also grew at a strong rate in the second quarter across nearly all end markets and geographies. Specifically, global C&I net sales increased 22% on an as-reported basis and 16% on a core basis as compared to the prior year. Strong growth in net sales for domestic C&I products in the second quarter was led by national rental equipment and telecom customers as well as our North American distributor channel.\nWe saw continued strength in demand during the quarter, which contributed to a further increase in our backlog for C&I products and supports our expectations for solid growth to continue in the category. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel also grew significantly in the second quarter, and improving close rates helped drive growth in orders and backlog in this channel. Strong momentum in quoting activity has continued as of late, highlighting the sustainability of demand trends for backup power for C&I applications.\nShipments to national telecom customers increased again during the second quarter as compared to the prior year as several of our larger telecom customers further invest in hardening their existing LTE sites and begin to build out their fifth generation or 5G networks. Telecom infrastructure upgrades remain one of the key megatrends we expect to drive growth for our business in the coming years.\nWe also experienced substantial growth with our national and independent rental equipment customers during the quarter. These customers have been investing heavily in equipment to refresh and expand their fleets, to serve increased commercial construction activity as well as other infrastructure projects, supporting a resilient demand environment for mobile products and the megatrend of the critical need for infrastructure improvements.\nWe also continue to see material traction in orders for Off Grid Energy's mobile energy storage systems from our key North American rental channel partners as they work to reduce the carbon footprint of their equipment fleets. Momentum remains strong across our domestic C&I channels and is being supplemented by emerging capabilities that support the long-term growth profile of the category. Specifically, we're establishing a strong reputation and applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects, driven by our ability to deliver customized turnkey solutions to serve this market.\nOur unique hardware and software portfolio in this vertical is highlighted by expanding smart grid-ready features that allow connection to grid services programs. Large C&I generators can provide enhanced resiliency and stability for grid operators while simultaneously providing a tangible and meaningfully improved return on investment for the asset owners, which is driving demand for these solutions across a diverse range of customers.\nStrong momentum also continued in our international segment, with total sales increasing 43% year-over-year during the second quarter, with 34% core sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America. The European region has seen strong demand across product lines as the heightened focus on energy independence and security that emerged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has continued. But longer-term implications are uncertain as geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions in the region remain volatile.\nInternational energy security concerns are not unique to Europe, and we are evaluating additional opportunities for home standby generators across multiple regions as a result. External sales in the Latin American region continued to grow at a solid rate, while intersegment sales grew substantially as our Generac Mexico operations continue to ramp production of telecom products for the North American market.\nIn addition to strong core growth, our recent international acquisitions, Deep Sea Electronics and Off Grid Energy reported impressive results in the second quarter. Demand for Off Grid Energy's mobile storage systems continues to grow across our global distribution footprint as we integrate the product offering through our commercial sales branches and channels. In addition, we have several product development projects underway within the C&I energy storage category, including expansion of the power capacity range of the mobile product lineup as well as potential stationary applications.\nConcerns around power security and energy prices in key international markets underpin the opportunity for an increasingly broad storage product portfolio for C&I applications. Deep Sea also benefited from healthy global demand for advanced generator controls during the quarter. And we remain very excited about the additional engineering capabilities Deep Sea brings as we leverage the team's electronics controls expertise to advance product road maps across our enterprise.\nOur international segment has also experienced much stronger profitability despite inflationary headwinds and supply chain challenges. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 14.5% from 9.7% in the prior year period due to the accretive margin profiles of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions, improved overhead absorption and better operating leverage on significantly higher volumes.\nIn closing this morning, I'm extremely proud of our team's continued ability to deliver record results and maintain our 2022 outlook despite the developing uncertain economic environment. Our strong sequential margin improvement reinforces our expectation that margins bottomed in the first quarter of 2022 and will continue to improve throughout this year. Additionally, our recent refinancing has provided further liquidity to accelerate our evolution into an energy technology solutions company.\nWe remain focused on executing against our Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy, and the megatrends supporting this strategy are as compelling as ever, many of which have the potential to decouple from the broader macroeconomic environment. Structural supply-demand imbalances facing the grid are not impacted by inflation, and increasingly severe and volatile weather cannot be slowed by higher interest rates.\nThe energy ecosystems that we are building for the future will give our end customers the ability to take control of their power security, lower their energy bills and reduce energy consumption while also helping utilities and grid operators to balance supply and demand. With our broad portfolio of products and solutions, combined with our services, our distribution, our brand and importantly, our expertise, Generac is uniquely positioned to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy future.\nI now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our second quarter 2022 results and our outlook for the year. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2022 results in more detail, net sales increased 40% to $1.29 billion during the second quarter of 2022, another all-time record, as compared to $920 million in the prior year's second quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 7% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class, residential product sales grew to $896 million as compared to $600 million in the prior year, representing a 49% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from our clean energy acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 7% of revenue growth for the quarter. Home standby generator sales made up the vast majority of the residential product core sales growth, increasing by more than 50% over the prior year as we continue to expand production capacity for these products.\nCommercial and industrial product net sales for the second quarter of 2022 increased 22% to $309 million as compared to $254 million in the prior-year quarter. Contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency had a net impact of approximately 6% on net sales growth during the quarter. The strong core revenue growth was broad-based, driven by growth across all regions globally and all channels domestically.\nNet sales for other products and services increased 31% to $86 million as compared to $66 million in the second quarter of 2021. Contributions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 13% of this revenue growth during the quarter. Strength in aftermarket service parts continues to be a key driver of the core sales growth in this category due to a larger and growing installed base of our products in the field, which is also leading to higher levels of extended warranty revenue. Also contributing to the increase was continued growth in our services offering in certain parts of our business.\nGross profit margin was 35.4% compared to 36.9% in the prior-year second quarter as the challenging supply chain and overall inflationary environment drove higher input costs during the quarter. Specifically, the lagging impact of elevated commodity prices and other surcharges, higher inbound logistics and expediting costs, increased labor rates, and continued plant ramp-up costs all pressured margins relative to the prior-year quarter.\nThe increasing realization of multiple pricing actions previously implemented and favorable sales mix partially offset these higher input costs. We're very encouraged that gross margins expanded 360 basis points on a sequential basis as pricing benefits increased and input costs began to ease during the second quarter, reinforcing our expectation that margins have bottomed in the first quarter.\nOperating expenses increased $83 million or 53% as compared to the second quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions and an increase in intangible amortization expense. Higher employee costs and additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes also contributed to the increase. Operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of revenue, increased approximately 75 basis points as compared to the prior year period due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales as those businesses scale for future growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest as defined in our earnings release was an all-time record $271 million or 21% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to $218 million or 23.7% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in EBITDA margin versus prior year was driven by the previously discussed decline in gross margins and higher operating expenses. But again, we're very pleased with the 370 basis point sequential improvement in EBITDA margins relative to Q1 2022.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 42% to $1.13 billion in the quarter as compared to $793 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 6% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $242 million, representing a 21.5% margin as compared to $204 million in the prior year or 25.7% of net sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to higher input costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the increasing realization of previously implemented pricing actions and favorable sales mix.\nInternational segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 43% to $203 million in the quarter as compared to $142 million in the prior-year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 34% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests was $29.5 million or 14.5% of net sales as compared to $13.7 million or 9.7% of net sales in the prior year. The significant expansion in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to strong margin contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and improved overhead absorption and operating leverage on significantly higher sales volumes.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2022 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $156 million as compared to $127 million for the second quarter of 2021. GAAP income taxes during the current year quarter were $45.8 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% as compared to $46.4 million or an effective tax rate of 26.6% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item in the prior-year quarter, resulting from a legislative tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction that unfavorably revalue deferred tax liabilities by $7 million, which had an approximate 4% tax rate impact to the prior-year quarter.\nDiluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.21 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $2.01 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $194 million in the current year quarter or $2.99 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $153 million in the prior year or $2.39 per share. Recall from last quarter, and as disclosed in our reconciliation schedules in our earnings release, our adjusted net income and EPS for the current year no longer adjust for cash taxes due to the expiration of our significant tax shield that originated from our LBO transaction in 2006.\nCash flow from operations was $24 million as compared to $123 million in the prior-year second quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $6 million as compared to $96 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a much higher working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Inventory levels stabilized in the second quarter, so the higher working capital investment during the current year quarter was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable, given sequential sales growth and a reduction in accounts payable as we optimize inventory levels and purchasing patterns. We expect free cash flow conversion to return to the historical long-term average in the second half of 2022, resulting in approximately 90% conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow.\nWe significantly enhanced our liquidity profile in the second quarter with the amendment of our existing credit facilities. This included establishing a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion, which was unfunded at closing. Proceeds from the $750 million new term loan were used to prepay $250 million of the existing term loan B facility and to fully pay off the existing ABL revolving credit facility, which had $285 million outstanding at closing, with the remaining funds added to the balance sheet to be used for general corporate purposes.\nOur new term loan A and revolving credit facility mature in June 2027. These new debt facilities will initially bear interest at SOFR plus 150 basis points through the end of 2022. And beginning on January 1, 2023, the applicable spread will range from 125 to 175 basis points, based on the company's total leverage ratio. Additionally, our existing term loan B does not mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of SOFR plus 175 basis points.\nWe also maintained our interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $1.72 billion of liquidity, comprised of $467 million of cash on hand and $1.25 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.37 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of only 1.5x on an as-reported basis.\nBefore discussing outlook, I want to highlight that we've been repurchasing our shares opportunistically thus far in the third quarter. In fact, we have exhausted the remaining $124 million of share repurchase authorization that existed as of the end of the second quarter. As a result, on July 29, 2022, the company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock over a 24-month period.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our outlook for 2022. As Aaron previously discussed, we are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2022. We continue to expect net sales to increase between 36% to 40% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 4% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook still assumes shipments of residential products increase at a mid- to high 40% rate during 2022. And revenue for C&I products is still expected to grow at a high teens rate compared to the prior year.\nLooking at seasonality for the second half of the year. Revenue is expected to increase sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, continuing the strong double-digit year-over-year growth trends, with fourth quarter sales levels up more modestly above the third quarter. Looking at our gross margin profile. As discussed, we expect that margins have bottomed in the first quarter. We continue to expect fourth quarter gross margins to recover back to first quarter 2021 levels in the 40% range, driven by increasing price realization, continued easing of inflationary pressures through the remainder of the year and further materialization of cost reduction benefits. This would result in gross margin percent for the full year 2022, to be approximately in line with 2021 levels, which is consistent with our previous expectations.\nOperating expenses as a percent of sales, excluding amortization expense, for the full year 2022 are still expected to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to full year 2021, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales as they continue to invest for future growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are still expected to be approximately 21.5% to 22.5% for the full year. From a seasonality perspective, adjusted EBITDA margins are projected to improve sequentially in the second half, primarily driven by improving gross margins as previously discussed, with fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins approaching 26%.\nSeveral additional guidance -- themes that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow require updating for the full year 2022. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 24% for the remaining quarters of the year, resulting in a full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 23%.\nFor full year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $52 million to $54 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $42 million to $44 million, reflecting our updated capital structure due to the refinancing of our credit facilities in June 2022. In addition, we have updated our interest rate assumptions to reflect the latest market expectations for SOFR in the second half of 2022. This assumes no additional changes in outstanding debt for the remainder of the year.\nDepreciation expense is still expected to be approximately $54 million to $56 million in 2022, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2022 is now expected to be approximately $100 million to $105 million as compared to our previous guidance of the high end of the $95 million to $100 million range. Stock comp expense is still expected to be between $32 million to $34 million for the year.\nOur full-year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be in the low -- at the low end of the previous guidance range of approximately 65 million to 65.5 million shares, given our share repurchase activity in July 2022. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. And as previously mentioned, free cash flow conversion is expected to return to historical norms of approximately 90% in the second half of the year. Finally, this 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Generac Holdings Inc., Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Now it is my pleasure to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mike Harris, Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael W. Harris\n\nVP of Corporate Development & IR, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation and other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.

Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another all-time record in shipments during the first quarter as net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all ahead of our previous expectations.\nThe revenue outperformance was primarily driven by continued progress on our capacity expansion plans and effective management of a challenging supply chain environment. This led to higher-than-expected shipments of home standby generators, PWRcell energy storage systems and C&I products globally.\nThe higher revenues drove adjusted EBITDA dollars, which were also ahead of our prior expectations, despite elevated input costs resulting in lower-than-expected margins in the quarter. Demand for our products also exceeded our expectations for the quarter, resulting in an increase in overall backlog from the end of 2021, with the home standby backlog remaining significant and providing us with considerable visibility in the quarters ahead.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales increased 41% to $1.14 billion and also grew sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021, which was the previous all-time record. We continue to experience robust and broad-based growth across the business with each of our residential and C&I product classes and Domestic and International reporting segments, all growing at incredibly strong double-digit rates as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis.\nStrong momentum in core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, continued in the quarter with 33% growth over the prior year, led by our residential product category. Overall, residential sales growth was again driven by a substantial increase in shipments of both home standby generators and PWRcell energy storage systems as well as the impact from recent acquisitions.\nThe C&I sales increase was led by our mobile and telecom channels domestically, growth across all regions internationally and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.3% were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher input costs, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges and the overall inflationary environment. Partially offsetting those cost headwinds were the increasing impact of multiple pricing actions implemented over the past year, favorable sales mix and the early impact of product cost reduction initiatives.\nImportantly, we expect growing realization of the previously announced price increases as 2022 progresses as well as incremental favorable margin impacts from additional pricing actions, which were enacted during the second quarter, further execution on cost reduction projects and easing input cost headwinds, resulting in sequentially improving margins throughout the year.\nNow discussing our first quarter results in more detail. Shipments of home standby generators in the first quarter grew at an exceptionally strong rate over the prior year and continues to benefit from the convergence of multiple megatrends that have significantly increased consumer awareness for the category. Power outage activity, as measured on a rolling 4-quarter basis, at the end of the first quarter was approximately in line with the long-term baseline average. And early forecast for the upcoming hurricane season are pointing to another year of above-average activity.\nAs discussed previously, home consultations faced a challenging comparison with the prior year due to the high-profile Texas winter storm event and several significant outages in other states in the first quarter of last year, but were in line with our expectations for the quarter. For some perspective, home consultations during the first quarter were nearly 3x higher than the levels seen in the first quarter of 2020, reinforcing our view that demand for the home standby category has once again achieved and held a new and higher baseline level.\nActivations, which are a proxy for installs, continued to grow at a solid rate compared to the prior year, led by the South Central and Midwest regions. We ended the quarter with over 8,100 residential dealers, an increase of more than 400 dealers over the past 12 months.\nWe made better-than-expected progress increasing production levels for home standby generators as daily build rates at our Wisconsin facilities further increased over prior year levels, and build rates continue to aggressively ramp sequentially at our new Trenton, South Carolina facility.\nHigher output levels are driving an important -- an improvement in lead times, which have been declining, to approximately 20 weeks from the approximately 27 weeks at the end of 2021. Despite the ongoing improvements in build rates and lead times, home standby backlog remains well above $1 billion. While build rates are projected to further increase throughout the year, we still expect to carry a meaningful portion of this backlog into 2023 even without the benefit of a major outage event in our forecast.\nIn response to higher inflationary pressures, we're also taking additional pricing actions in the home standby category in the second quarter, and we expect to realize the benefit of these additional increases primarily during the second half of 2022. New orders now reflect this higher pricing, and orders in backlog will also see a price increase effective June 1. In addition to the several pricing actions we've taken, significant cost reduction initiatives and moderating input costs are expected to further benefit margins for the product category moving forward.\nOur Clean Energy products contributed meaningfully to overall growth in the first quarter as shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew significantly from the prior year period, as our team successfully navigated industry-wide supply chain and logistic challenge.\nSupporting this rapid growth is the continued build-out of our installer network as we ended the first quarter with more than 2,600 trained and certified dealers with approximately 1,100 registered on our PowerPlay sales platform. In response to rising input and expedited logistics costs, we've also recently implemented additional price increases for our Clean Energy products.\nIn spite of policy-related uncertainty in the near term, we believe the megatrends and secular growth drivers underpinning consumer demand for residential Clean Energy solutions is as compelling as ever. We remain very optimistic about the new and innovative product offerings we're bringing to market in 2022, including our new PV microinverter product offering called the PWRmicro, which has continued to receive significant prelaunch interest from our channel partners.\nIn addition, our recently launched PowerManager load control device has garnered positive feedback in the market. And we expect this industry-leading innovative product to further strengthen our position within the residential energy storage market. We are still expecting Clean Energy revenue growth well above 50% for the full year, with continued strength in PWRcell energy storage systems along with contributions from the initial rollout of new products.\nI'd now like to provide a quick update on ecobee. We're seeing good progress in developing cross-selling opportunities for ecobee's hardware solutions with Generac's retail and wholesale partners. Longer term, we're pursuing opportunities with residential and Clean Energy dealers as well as working to leverage ecobee's existing HVAC dealer base to sell Generac products. In the smart thermostat product category, the ecobee brand resonates well with consumers, and we have exciting new product introductions coming here in the second quarter.\nAdditionally, ecobee's dedicated energy services team has seen a number of wins with several utilities and grid operators, including a recently announced demand response program with a local utility provider in Colorado. This is a simple but important example of a program that can be replicated across the country, which allows for the adjustment of ecobee smart thermostats during periods of high demand, resulting in energy conservation, financial benefits for homeowners and improved grid stability.\nWe're also seeing promising commercial developments between ecobee and Generac Grid Services, with utilities having an increasing interest in ecobee's product offerings. The Generac Grid Services and ecobee sales teams are jointly bidding on projects. And this collaboration offers significant growth potential in a large and rapidly expanding market by leveraging ecobee's growing installed base of more than 2 million connected homes.\nOur ability to increase our share of the value stack of a Grid Services program is also improving the economics and payback for homeowners, which has the potential to improve demand for ecobee hardware as well as participation in Grid Services programs.\nExpanding a bit more on Generac Grid Services. The team is executing on its strategic vision and has an increasingly impressive and diverse sales pipeline that includes expanding the cross-selling of Generac equipment, along with other opportunities beyond Software-as-a-Service contracts, driven by our unique hardware plus software plus services value proposition. Generac Grid Services also experienced strong growth during the quarter in key metrics such as connected assets under management. And we signed and closed a number of important Software-as-a-Service, turnkey and performance contracts.\nIn addition, a growing proportion of hardware orders, including home standby generators and PWRcell energy storage systems, along with other contracts in the final stages of negotiation, have improved our line of sight for a significant ramp in this business during 2022.\nImportantly, the Generac Grid Services team is making great progress integrating Generac's products on to the Concerto software platform to create complete solutions for utilities and grid operators. We are excited about the economic and societal value of these opportunities as we work to facilitate the decentralization, the digitization and the decarbonization of the power grid.\nNow let me make some comments on our C&I products, which also grew rapidly in the first quarter, with strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Specifically, global C&I net sales increased 38% on an as-reported basis and 24% on a core basis as compared to the prior year. Strong growth in net sales for domestic C&I products in the first quarter was led by national telecom and rental equipment customers as well as growing demand for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects.\nWe also have a substantial backlog for C&I products, which increased further during the first quarter, supporting our expectations for solid growth to continue in the category. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew again in the first quarter, and improving close rates helped drive growth in orders and backlog in this channel.\nShipments to national telecom customers increased significantly during the first quarter as compared to the prior year, benefiting from elevated levels of capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers. The catalyst for the investment in backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by the elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California and the growing number of connected wireless devices alongside the build-out of high-powered and increasingly critical 5G communications infrastructure.\nWe also experienced very strong growth with our national and independent rental customers this quarter. These customers are investing heavily in fleet equipment. And we remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products, given the megatrend of the critical need for infrastructure improvements and recently passed legislation supporting infrastructure spending.\nWe're also very excited about the opportunity to bring our mobile energy storage solutions, which we recently added through the Off Grid Energy acquisition in the U.K. to the North American market in 2022. And we have already seen meaningful order activity from key domestic channel partners for these products.\nAdditionally, we're experiencing significant momentum in project wins for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional standby power generation such as their use in Energy-as-a-Service, microgrid solutions and other distributed generation projects. A diverse range of customers from national and regional commercial accounts to municipalities and beyond are showing substantial interest in these solutions.\nWe believe this demand is being driven by the need for enhanced resiliency and grid stability that these larger blocks of power offer for grid operators while simultaneously providing a tangible and meaningfully improved return on investment for the asset owners.\nStrong momentum also continued in our International segment as well, with shipments increasing 49% year-over-year on an as-reported basis during the first quarter, with 27% core net sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America. Overall demand remains very strong across our International segment, with backlog further increasing since our fourth quarter earnings call.\nThe European region is seeing particularly strong demand for portable generators, mobile products and C&I generators, due in part to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the near term, a heightened focus on energy independence and security has emerged in the region. But longer-term implications of the conflict remain uncertain, given the troubling and very fluid nature of the situation.\nIn addition to strong core growth, our recent international energy technology acquisitions, Deep Sea Electronics and Off Grid Energy, reported impressive results in the first quarter. Numerous sales synergies are developing for Off Grid Energy's mobile storage systems through Generac's global distribution footprint, resulting in incremental demand in new geographies and driving significant backlog for these products. We have also begun additional product development projects within the mobile storage category to significantly expand the power capacity range of the product lineup.\nGlobal demand for Deep Sea's controls and automation products at are at all-time highs. And order intake has surpassed our previous expectations. With respect to synergies, we are further embedding Deep Sea controls and technology into our legacy C&I products globally. Additionally, Deep Sea provides important capabilities that are core to the growth of our portfolio of our portfolio grid-connected Energy-as-a-Service and microgrid solutions.\nOur International segment has also experienced much stronger profitability despite inflationary headwinds and supply chain challenges. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 15.2% from 6.2% in the prior year period due to the accretive margin profiles of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions, improved overhead absorption and better operating leverage on significantly higher volumes.\nIn closing today, I'm extremely proud of Generac team's efforts in delivering record sales -- record net sales results and navigating the difficult operating environment to deliver overall results that exceeded our previous expectations. We'll be discussing in detail our 2022 forecast update during the outlook portion of our prepared comments this morning. But in short, we're raising our net sales guidance for full year 2022 and maintaining our overall guidance for adjusted EBITDA dollars, which reflects the visibility provided from our increased backlog and confidence in our ability to execute.\nSupply chain challenges and the overall inflationary environment have persisted, but we believe we've also taken appropriate measures to offset these ongoing headwinds. While we are tactically executing on our near-term initiatives, we remain focused on the longer-term megatrends for our business and their alignment with the strategic pillars of our Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy.\nAs we execute on our strategic plan, we're building out an ecosystem of connected energy technology solutions for both the residential and C&I markets to address the challenges faced by the aging electrical grid and the serious supply and demand imbalances that are developing. We remain confident and squarely focused on building out the solutions portfolio as the modernization of the power grid is expected to significantly expand our addressable markets and ultimately lead to further growth opportunities for our business in the years ahead.\nI now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter 2022 results and our updated outlook for 2022. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2022 results in more detail. Net sales increased 41% to $1.14 billion during the first quarter of 2022, another all-time record, as compared to $807 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate plus 7% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales grew to $777 million as compared to $542 million in the prior year, representing a 43% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from the ecobee and Chilicon acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 5% of revenue growth for the quarter.\nHome standby generator sales made up the majority of the residential product core sales growth, increasing by approximately 50% over the prior year as we continue to expand production capacity for these products. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year as the U.S. residential solar plus storage market continues to grow and as we expand our distribution network for our Clean Energy solutions.\nPartially offsetting this strength, portable generators faced a tough prior year comparison due to the significant outages caused from the severe winter storm impacting several states in the first quarter of 2021, including the high-profile Texas winter storm event.\nCommercial and industrial product net sales for the first quarter of 2022 increased 38% to $279 million as compared to $202 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency had a net positive impact of approximately 13% on net sales growth during the quarter.\nThe very strong core revenue growth was broad-based, driven by growth across all regions, highlighted by robust telecom and rental volumes. Net sales for the other products and services category increased 28% to $80 million as compared to $63 million in the first quarter of 2021. Contributions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 8% of revenue growth during the quarter.\nStrength in aftermarket service parts continues to be a key driver of the core sales growth in this category due to the heightened power outage activity in recent years and a larger and growing install base of our products in the field, which is also leading to higher levels of extended warranty revenue. Also contributing to the increase were continued growth in our services offering in certain parts of our business and higher Grid Services subscription revenue.\nGross profit margin was 31.8% compared to 39.9% in the prior year first quarter as the challenging supply chain and overall inflationary environment drove higher input costs during the quarter. Specifically, the lagging impact of elevated commodity prices and other component surcharges, higher inbound logistics and expediting costs, increased labor rates and continued plant ramp-up costs all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The increasing realization of multiple price actions previously implemented and favorable sales mix partially offset these margin headwinds.\nOperating expenses increased $73 million or 55% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions together with the increase in intangible amortization expense. In addition, higher employee costs and additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes also contributed to the increase.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization, increased approximately 50 basis points as compared to the prior year period due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales, given their start-up nature.\nAdjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $196 million or 17.3% of net sales in the first quarter as compared to $214 million or 26.5% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in EBITDA margin was driven by the previously discussed decline in gross margins.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 39% to $965 million in the quarter as compared to $693 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 5% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $170 million, representing a 17.7% margin as compared to $207 million in the prior year or 29.9% of net sales.\nThe lower Domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to significantly higher input costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the increasing realization of previously implemented pricing actions and favorable sales mix.\nInternational segment sales increased 49% to $171 million in the quarter as compared to $115 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 27% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, was $26 million or 15.2% of net sales as compared to $7.1 million or 6.2% of net sales in the prior year.\nThe significant expansion in International EBITDA margins was primarily due to strong margin contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and improved overhead absorption and operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $114 million as compared to $149 million for the first quarter of 2021. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $28.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% as compared to $35.4 million or an effective tax rate of 19.1% in the prior year.\nThe year-over-year increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower discrete benefit from equity compensation in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year. The effective tax rate in the first quarter is seasonally below our full year 2022 guidance, due primarily to the timing of vesting of certain equity awards and the related benefit recognized for tax purposes.\nDiluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.57 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $2.33 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $135 million in the current year quarter or $2.09 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $153 million in the prior year or $2.38 per share. As disclosed in our reconciliation schedules in our earnings release, our adjusted net income and EPS for the current year no longer adjusts for cash taxes due to the expiration of our significant tax shield that originated from our LBO transaction in 2006.\nCash flow from operations was negative $10 million as compared to positive $153 million in the prior year first quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was negative $37 million as compared to positive $126 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a much higher working capital investment in the current year quarter.\nThe higher working capital investment was primarily driven by seasonal inventory build for certain product categories, increasing production rates and further increases in inventory levels due to the challenging supply chain environment and extended logistics in-transit times.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had approximately $500 million of liquidity, comprised of $206 million of cash on hand and $290 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in May 2026. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.09 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of only 1.3x on an as-reported basis.\nIn addition, recall our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2022. As Aaron previously discussed, our strong execution and ability to maneuver through this challenging supply chain environment allowed us to exceed shipment expectations during the first quarter of 2022. In addition, the higher-than-expected inflationary environment that has manifested over the last couple of months has required us to implement another round of price increases here in the second quarter of 2022.\nAs a result of these factors, we are raising our top line guidance for full year 2022 as net sales are now expected to increase between 36% to 40% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 5% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the previous guidance of net sales growth between 32% to 36%.\nThis revenue outlook now assumes shipments of residential products increase at a mid- to high 40% rate during 2022, up from prior expectation for a low 40% rate. And revenue for C&I products is still expected to grow at a high-teens rate compared to the prior year despite larger-than-expected FX headwinds.\nImportantly, this guidance still assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. As a result, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year. Given we still expect to be producing at full capacity for home standby generators throughout the year, the upside of a major power outage would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2022, meaning any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage would most likely result in incremental revenue in 2023.\nAs we ramp capacity and our supply chain for home standby and Clean Energy products and as incremental price realization kicks in over the remainder of the year, we're expecting quarterly revenue to increase sequentially over the next couple of quarters, with net sales in the first half approaching 47% weighted as a percent of full year sales.\nLooking at our gross margin profile. As we have discussed at length, cost pressures have continued to impact our profitability thus far in 2022. We expect first quarter 2022 to be the peak of this year-over-year price/cost headwind. As price realization has a more meaningful positive impact on our gross margins, certain inflationary pressures progressively ease for the remainder of the year and as the benefits of our focused cost reduction initiatives further materialize.\nAs a result of these factors, we expect quarterly gross margin percent to increase sequentially throughout 2022, with fourth quarter gross margins expected to recover back to first quarter 2021 levels in the 40% range. This would result in gross margin percent for the full year 2022 to be approximately in line with 2021 levels.\nLooking at operating expenses as a percent of sales. Excluding amortization expense, we expect full year 2022 OpEx percent to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to full year 2021, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales given their start-up nature.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the full year 2022 before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 21.5% to 22.5% compared to the previously expected range of approximately 22% to 23%. The additional price increases required to offset the higher-than-expected inflationary pressures are resulting in this modest EBITDA percent dilution from previous expectation. Importantly, the midpoint of this guidance range would result in adjusted EBITDA dollars in line with our previous guidance.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, adjusted EBITDA margins are projected to improve significantly as we move through the year, primarily driven by improving gross margins as previously discussed. We expect that the first quarter marked the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, with the progression of sequential improvement approximately level-loaded by a quarter, resulting in fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins returning to the 26% range, similar to Q1 2021 levels.\nSeveral additional guidance items that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow also require updating for the full year 2022. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 23% to 24% for the remaining quarters of the year, resulting in a full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 23%. This compares to our previous full year 2022 guidance of 24% to 25%. This decrease is driven primarily by the higher-than-expected equity compensation deduction in the first quarter as well as lower state income taxes expected during the full year 2022.\nFor full year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $42 million to $44 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $41 million to $43 million, reflecting higher than previously expected levels of LIBOR rates throughout 2022, while still assuming no additional term loan principal payments during the year.\nDepreciation expense is now forecast to be approximately $54 million to $56 million in 2022, given our assumed CapEx guidance, as compared to $56 million to $58 million previously expected. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2022 is now expected to be at the high end of the previously expected range of $95 million to $100 million. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $32 million to $34 million for the year.\nAs a result of these updated guidance items in our first quarter performance, net income as a percent of sales is expected to be similar to our prior guidance. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to be approximately 65.0 million to 65.5 million shares. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year.\nFor full year 2022, operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to follow historical seasonality and be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year. Given the very strong organic sales growth expected during 2022, we still expect the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 70% to 80% for the full year as a portion of cash flows will be invested in working capital to support this growth.\nFinally, this updated 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Michael Harris, VP, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael W. Harris\n\nVP of Corporate Development & IR, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors.\nIn addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nI will now turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a great finish to an outstanding 2021 for Generac, with all-time record performance for both the quarter and the full year for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as we achieved record quarterly production levels and continued to experience exceptional demand for our products and our solutions.\nAdditionally, we completed the strategic acquisition of ecobee during the quarter, which represents a major step forward in our efforts to provide a broader residential energy ecosystem that includes intelligent monitoring and management solutions as well as an increasingly sophisticated user interface platform.\nFourth quarter revenue was well ahead of our expectations, driven by higher shipments of home standby generators as build rates for the quarter exceeded our plan due to strong operational execution. Shipments of C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter, with broad-based strength continuing across all channels and regions.\nDespite the substantial increase in production levels, our backlog continued to grow in the fourth quarter across the business, highlighted by home standby generators, providing us with substantial visibility into 2022 being another year of exceptional revenue growth.\nYear-over-year, overall net sales for the fourth quarter increased 40% to $1.07 billion, an all-time record, and also increased sequentially over the third quarter, which was the previous all-time record. Notably, fourth quarter core sales growth of 35% accelerated relative to the third quarter's core growth rate of 30%, highlighting our strong execution and the progress we continue to make in ramping capacity despite ongoing supply chain challenges.\nGrowth in the quarter was broad-based with both residential and C&I products growing at a low 40% rate compared to the year ago period. Residential sales growth was once again driven by a substantial increase in home standby generator shipments and continued momentum in PWRcell energy storage shipments as well as the impact from recent acquisitions.\nThe C&I sales increase was led by our telecom and mobile channels domestically, growth across all major regions internationally and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% were lower year-over-year as it reflected the impact of higher input costs, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges and the overall inflationary environment as well as the impact of additional operating expense from acquisitions.\nPartially offsetting these cost headwinds were the initial impact of multiple pricing actions implemented over the past year. And we expect even greater realization of these price increases, along with cost-reduction initiatives and other favorable margin impacts as 2022 progresses.\nBefore discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some full year 2021 financial highlights as well as share some key accomplishments that we achieved during the year. First and foremost, I want to thank our team of over 9,500 employees globally for their hard work and perseverance throughout an incredibly challenging operating environment in 2021. Our teams have helped us successfully navigate the pandemic while still providing an incredible level of service to our customers and our partners around the world. The hyperscale growth that we are experiencing is a reflection of their commitment to the execution of our strategy and their dedication to our success.\nAs a result of our team's collective efforts, Generac achieved another year of record revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2021, far exceeding the previous record levels seen last year. In fact, revenue increased by approximately $1.3 billion, representing 50% growth year-over-year and marking the highest annual growth rate in our history as a public company. This performance came on top of very strong revenue growth over the 3 previous years that averaged in the mid-teens and was highlighted by tremendous growth in home standby generator shipments and approximate doubling of clean energy revenue and strong and broad-based growth in our global C&I products.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year was $861 million, with a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1% that was similar to the prior year despite a variety of supply chain challenges, considerable inflationary headwinds and significant investments for future growth. In the third quarter of 2021, we achieved an important milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our newest facility in Trenton, South Carolina. And we continue to make excellent progress in ramping production levels at this new facility as well as at our existing facilities in Wisconsin.\nAdditionally, the further build-out of our clean energy market opportunity was a key highlight during the year as we significantly grew shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems through the expansion of our supply chain, increased targeted marketing efforts, growth in our distribution network and the introduction of several exciting new products.\nWe also broadened our Energy Technology Solutions portfolio with several strategic acquisitions, highlighted by Deep Sea Electronics, Chilicon Power, Apricity Code, Off Grid Energy, Tank Utility and ecobee.\n2021 was also a heavy year of new products as we introduced our market-leading 26-kilowatt home standby generator, our Generac branded microinverter that we call PWRmicro, the industry's first dedicated engine-driven battery charging system we call PWRgenerator and our innovative PWRmanager load control device.\nWe also introduced a host of new C&I products this year, including a hybrid mobile power solution pairing a mobile energy storage system with a traditional mobile generator, a mobile battery-powered light tower and our first C&I battery storage system for the North American market through the Off Grid acquisition.\nWe also announced smart grid ready capabilities for all our home standby generators, PWRcell energy storage systems and our natural gas C&I generators. Smart grid ready technology is important to advancing our turnkey approach to grid services and enabling these products to be utilized in programs that provide grid resiliency and an incremental ROI for the asset owner.\nFinally, during our 2021 Investor Day last September, we debuted our new enterprise strategy we call Powering a Smarter World, which focuses on improving energy resilience and independence, optimizing energy efficiency and consumption, and protecting and building critical infrastructure. We also published our inaugural environmental, social and governance report, highlighting the alignment of our new strategy to key ESG-related external frameworks and standards.\nThese accomplishments provide us considerable momentum as we head into 2022. The guidance we are initiating today is for another year of significant revenue growth between 32% and 36%, which is expected to be driven by further increases in home standby production throughout the year, strong growth in clean energy markets, continued broad-based global demand for C&I products and contributions from recent acquisitions. Notably, this full year 2022 guidance projects an approximate doubling of Generac's revenue as compared to 2020 levels, with organic growth accounting for the vast majority of the increase.\nIn addition to the significant top line growth, we expect to maintain attractive margins while continuing to make aggressive investments in next-generation energy technology solutions. We credit these accomplishments to the agility and dedication of the Generac team as we overcome short-term operational challenges and remain focused on our long-term purpose of leading the evolution to more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions.\nNow discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail. Demand for home standby generators in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from important megatrends, which further expanded consumer awareness of the category. The Home as a Sanctuary trend remains a key driver of demand, along with the impacts of more extreme weather resulting in elevated power outage activity over the past several quarters, including 3 major outages over the past 18 months. The combination of these factors, along with broader electrification trends, continues to drive incredibly strong demand for home standby generators. As a result, home consultations or sales leads increased again in the fourth quarter over the robust prior year comparison and for the year grew at a strong double-digit rate, and we're nearly 4x the full year 2019 levels.\nActivations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew at a significant rate compared to the prior year. And our distribution footprint ended the fourth quarter with 8,100 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 800 dealers over the last 12 months. As we have discussed, we continue to make encouraging progress increasing production levels for home standby generators, most notably at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina, as daily build rates at all our facilities were dramatically higher when compared to prior year levels.\nBuild rates also grew sequentially as we added a new production line at both the Trenton and Jefferson, Wisconsin facilities during the quarter. As a result of the higher output levels, lead times have declined by approximately 4 to 5 weeks from 32 weeks at the end of the third quarter. However, home standby order rates have remained very strong, leading to a further increase in our backlog, which currently is still well over $1 billion and provides excellent visibility into 2022 revenue growth. Output levels are projected to increase further throughout the year as additional capacity comes online. However, demand has remained strong. And although we expect to exit the year with improved lead times, we anticipate that we will still end 2022 with a significant backlog for home standby generators.\nMany of the same factors underpinning tremendous demand for home standby generators, along with the increasing penetration of solar installations, are also helping drive rapid growth for our clean energy products. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew significantly in the quarter as compared to the prior year and also grew at a strong double-digit rate sequentially. Despite industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges impacting our clean energy solutions, full year 2021 clean energy-related revenue approximately doubled as end-user demand remains robust for our PWRcell energy storage systems.\nIn addition to strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy products continued to show favorable trends in the fourth quarter. Home consultation and system activations both increased at a strong rate over the prior year and also increased sequentially. In addition, we further built out our clean energy installer network as we ended the fourth quarter with nearly 2,500 trained and certified dealers with approximately 1,000 dealers registered on our PowerPlay sales platform.\nThe solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly, and we expect to see significant year-over-year growth again during 2022. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems are anticipated to increase substantially during the year. And we expect clean energy revenues to grow aggressively as compared to the 2021 levels. We're also very excited about beginning shipments of the previously mentioned new product introductions for clean energy, which are expected to contribute incrementally in 2022. This includes our new PV microinverter product offering called PWRmicro, with shipments expected to begin toward the end of the second quarter and ramping further during the second half of the year.\nA key component of future growth for our clean energy offerings is establishing and developing our distribution network, including partnering with large national solar providers. We recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Sunnova that adds even more of Generac's industry-leading technology to its current suite of offerings.\nIn addition to energy storage systems, Sunnova customers will now have access to the industry's only fully integrated lineup of home standby generators, microinverters and load control devices delivered from a single equipment provider. The scope of the new agreement includes integrating both companies' software platforms, enabling the joint participation in grid services programs across the U.S. Additionally, Sunnova's consumer-friendly financing solution will now be made available to Generac's certified dealers for all their customers' financing needs, including home standby generators. We're very excited about our expanded partnership as it grows distribution capacity for our residential products, increases financing opportunities for potential home standby customers and facilitate additional growth in grid services.\nI'd now like to provide an update on the ecobee acquisition, which closed in December and which helps to accelerate Generac's evolution into an energy technology company. We believe we can leverage ecobee's existing technology and capabilities to develop a home energy management platform, which will be core to our growing residential energy ecosystem of the future that benefits both homeowners and grid operators. This platform will enable homeowners to make smarter energy production, storage and consumption decisions while also integrating with our Concerto software platform to provide grid operators more efficient access to a home's distributed energy resources.\nImportantly, while still very early, we are already starting to see near-term commercial synergies from the acquisition as the initial integration with our existing commercial sales channels has been encouraging, including expansion into Generac's residential and clean energy dealer networks as well as key retail relationships. In addition, ecobee has a sizable dedicated sales team directly engaging utilities and grid operators with their ecobee energy program, which is aimed at developing demand response and load control opportunities.\nOur Generac Grid Services team has begun working closely with this group to coordinate and expand these efforts to develop our sales pipeline together by leveraging ecobee's more than 2 million connected homes as a valuable installed base of potential distributed energy resources. I'd also like to provide a further update on Generac Grid Services, a group recently formed within the company that builds upon our October 2020 acquisition of Enbala Power Networks.\nGenerac Grid Services has been making excellent progress in expanding its sales pipeline, including meaningful opportunities beyond traditional software-as-a-service contracts. The fourth quarter saw significant progress in new deals closed and in the final stages of negotiation, increasing our top line visibility for 2022. The Grid Services team continues to integrate Generac's products and solutions into the Concerto software platform, with the resulting hardware cross-selling opportunities expanding the sales funnel even further. We believe this creates a unique advantage for Generac in the market for grid services given our increasingly unmatched set of energy technology assets and industry-leading derms platform, helping us to maintain momentum with utilities, grid operators and energy retailers while raising our profile with key decision makers in the utility industry.\nWe also recently announced a key win for Generac Grid Services to build virtual power plants, or VPPs, by recruiting and enrolling Generac solar PV and battery storage system owners for Southern California Edison's PowerFlex program. This initiative gives SoCal Edison's residential customers the opportunity to earn incentives by allowing some of their carbon-free electricity stored in their PWRcell energy storage systems to be dispatched for grid stability purposes. Public sector support for grid services opportunities has been increasing, highlighted by the numerous programs within the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that target grid flexibility and resilience and encourage utilities and grid operators to develop and manage virtual power plants using distributed energy resources.\nNow let me make some comments on our C&I business, which grew rapidly in the fourth quarter as key end markets and geographies continued to recover off the softer prior year impacted by the pandemic. Global C&I product sales increased 43% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year and 30% on a core basis, which was well above 2019 levels during the quarter.\nOur domestic C&I products saw growth across all channels in the fourth quarter, led by national telecom and rental equipment customers. We also have a record backlog for C&I products, which increased further during the fourth quarter and has continued to build here in the first quarter, providing good visibility for another year of meaningful growth in 2022.\nShipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew again at a solid rate. And the channel continued to experience strong quoting and order activity along with improving close rates and market share gains in the quarter. We're also experiencing strong growth with our Energy Systems industrial distributor business in Northern California that we acquired in 2020 as our investments and overall increased focus in this important backup power market are producing excellent results. In working to build on this success, in the fourth quarter, we acquired the Power Generation Group of (inaudible) Material Handling, our industrial distributor based in Southern California, further expanding our presence in the large and growing West Coast market.\nShipments to telecom national account customers increased dramatically again during the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, benefiting from elevated levels of capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers. The catalyst for the investment in backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power and the build-out of 5G networks. The long-term demand outlook for backup power in the telecom sector remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications.\nWe also experienced very strong growth with our national rental equipment customers as shipments of mobile products continued to recover at a significant rate off the pandemic-driven lows of 2020. These customers are investing heavily in fleet equipment, and we remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products given the mega trend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements.\nWe expect that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in late 2021 will support a higher level of capital spending by rental equipment companies over the next several years. Additionally, we're experiencing ongoing strength in project quoting and improved close rates for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as their use in Energy as a Service, microgrid solutions and other distributed generation projects. Order rates for generators used in these applications increased dramatically during the full year 2021. We believe the increased interest in these products is being driven by the need for enhanced resiliency and grid stability that these large blocks of power offer for grid operators while simultaneously providing a tangible and meaningful return on investment for the asset owners.\nInternationally, we continue to see strong momentum as well with shipments increasing 47% year-over-year on an as-reported basis during the fourth quarter, with 26% core net sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all major regions and has recovered well above the levels from 2019.\nOverall, quoting and order activity continued to accelerate at a strong pace in key international markets in the fourth quarter, driving growth in the international backlog and higher visibility for 2022. We have also seen a growing interest in home standby generators in certain international markets, highlighting the potential for the product category's addressable market to grow significantly beyond the still underpenetrated U.S. market.\nCleaner burning natural gas C&I generators are also experiencing positive momentum internationally as we work to educate the global market on the benefits of natural gas fuel generators over their traditional diesel solutions. The International segment's fourth quarter EBITDA margin expanded to 13.9% from 6.8% in the year-ago period due to the accretive margin profiles of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, improved overhead absorption on higher volumes and realization from pricing actions, which were implemented throughout 2021.\nThe integrations of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions are progressing well as we continue expanding the reach of their energy technology solutions through our global distribution channels. Off Grid has seen very strong market interest for its mobile energy storage systems in new regions and with legacy Generac customers. And we are very excited to bring this innovative battery storage solution to the North American equipment rental market in 2022.\nThe Deep Sea acquisition has substantially expanded our global controls and electronics engineering teams and provides important capabilities that are core to the growth of our portfolio of grid-connected Energy as a Service and microgrid solutions.\nIn closing today, 2021 was a year of tremendous progress for Generac as we significantly expanded our capacity and further accelerated our evolution to an energy technology company with a number of key strategic investments across product categories and regions. We believe this growth has resulted in market share gains in every part of our business during 2021. And I'm extremely proud of the hard work of our teams to achieve such strong results despite the incredibly challenging operating environment.\nAs we look forward, we believe we are just getting started on our newly introduced Powering and Smarter World enterprise strategy. Through the combination of aggressive organic investment and strategic acquisitions, we have built a portfolio of power generation and storage systems, monitoring and management devices, and platform and controls capabilities that provide for resiliency as well as participation in grid services programs, thereby creating enormous value for an increasingly broad range of stakeholders.\nWith these solutions, in tandem with our services, our distribution, our brand and importantly, our expertise, Generac is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the ongoing modernization and evolution of our electrical grid to be more flexible, cleaner and smarter.\nI now want to turn the call over to York to provide some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our new outlook for 2022. York?\n\nYork A. Ragen\n\nCFO & CAO, Generac Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 40% to $1.07 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, an all-time record as compared to $761 million in the prior year fourth quarter. the combination of contributions from the Deep Sea, Chilicon, Off Grid, Tank Utility and ecobee acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 5% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2021 increased 50% to approximately $3.74 billion, also an all-time record for the company.\nBriefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales grew to $706 million as compared to $499 million in the prior year, representing a 42% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from the ecobee and Chilicon acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% of revenue growth for the quarter.\nHome standby generator sales made up of the majority of the residential product growth, increasing by approximately 50% over the prior year as we continue to make significant progress in expanding production capacity for these products despite the challenging supply chain environment.\nShipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year as overall solar market growth, rising storage attachment rates and our expanding distribution continue to drive growth for our clean energy solutions. An increase in shipments of portable generators and shore products also contributed to growth in the quarter.\nCommercial and industrial product net sales for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 43% to $284 million as compared to $199 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency had a combined impact of approximately 13% on net sales growth during the quarter. The very strong core revenue growth was driven by an impressive growth across all domestic C&I channels in all major regions internationally. While this growth rate was aided by the softer prior comparison impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our C&I revenue was up approximately 19% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels, which highlights the strong demand that we are seeing across most C&I markets.\nDomestically, the C&I growth was driven by a significant increase in shipments to telecom national account customers resulting from the much higher capital spending as these customers continue to harden their wireless networks. We also experienced strong growth in mobile product shipments to our rental channel customers as they continue to invest in their fleets, given strength in their end markets. Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors as well as higher shipments of natural gas generators used in beyond standby applications.\nInternationally, the increase in C&I products was broad-based from a geographic standpoint, with growth in all major regions as global C&I markets continue to experience a sharp increase in demand of the softer prior comparison impacted by COVID and had recovered well above 2019 levels. Net sales for other products and services increased 21% to $77 million as compared to $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Recall this product category is primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings. Contributions from the ecobee and Tank Utility acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 4% of revenue growth during the quarter. Strength in aftermarket service parts continues to be a core driver of sales growth in the category as heightened power outage activity and a larger installed base is driving increased demand. We're also experiencing higher levels of extended warranty revenue on a larger and growing base of extended warranty contracts. Also contributing to the increase were higher levels of remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue as well as increases in other services.\nGross profit margin was 34% compared to 39.4% in the prior year fourth quarter as the challenging supply chain and overall inflationary environment drove input costs significantly higher during the quarter. Specifically, the lagging impact of rising steel prices, inbound logistics costs and labor rates, along with the Trenton plant start-up, all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The early realization of initial pricing actions partially offset these margin pressures. Importantly, our backlog as of the end of the year contains multiple rounds of additional price actions that will be increasingly realized in the coming quarters.\nOperating expenses increased $58 million or 44.8% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, but declined approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization and transaction-related costs. The overall increase in OpEx dollars was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions, and related transaction costs, higher employee and marketing spend, additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes and increased amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $220 million or 20.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to $196 million or 25.7% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests came in at an all-time record of $861 million, resulting in a strong 23.1% margin that was similar to the 23.5% margin in the prior year despite the challenging operating environment and acquisitions that impacted margins during 2021.\nI will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 39% to $896 million in the quarter as compared to $645 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $197 million, representing a 21.9% margin as compared to $188 million in the prior year or 29.1% of net sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to the significantly higher input costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the early realization of pricing actions implemented throughout the year.\nFor the full year 2021, Domestic segment sales increased 52% over the prior year to $3.16 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 25.1% compared to 27.0% in the prior year.\nInternational segment sales increased 47% to $171 million in the quarter as compared to $116 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 26% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $23.7 million or 13.9% of net sales as compared to $7.8 million or 6.8% of net sales in the prior year. The significant expansion in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to strong margin contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, improved overhead absorption and operating leverage as well as the impact of pricing actions.\nFor the full year 2021, International segment sales increased 45% over the prior year to $573 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests were 11.5% of net sales during 2021, a 640 basis point increase compared to the 5.1% margin in the prior year.\nNow switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $143 million as compared to $125 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $20.6 million or an effective tax rate of 12.4% as compared to $39 million or an effective tax rate of 23.8% in the prior year. The decline in effective tax rate was primarily due to certain discrete items related to acquisitions and a higher stock compensation deduction during the current year.\nDiluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.04 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.97 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was an all-time record $162 million in the current year quarter or $2.51 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $136 million in the prior year or $2.12 per share.\nCash income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $29.7 million as compared to $34.9 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects a cash income tax rate of approximately 19.7% for the full year 2021 compared to our previous expectation of approximately 20.0% to 20.5%. The decrease is primarily driven by a higher level of stock compensation deduction than previously expected. This full year cash tax rate for 2021 compares to the prior year rate of 17.9%. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus the prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate, along with an increase in nondeductible goodwill from acquisitions.\nCash flow from operations was $62 million as compared to [$218] million in the prior year fourth quarter. And free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was $42 million as compared to $191 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a much higher working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by an increase in operating earnings and lower capital expenditures relative to the prior year.\nThe higher working capital investment was primarily driven by further elevated inventory levels at the end of the year, resulting from extended logistics in transit times, ongoing supply chain constraints, increasing production rates and continued investments in the ramping of our new Trenton facility.\nWe repurchased 350,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter for $126 million under our current share repurchase program. And we have approximately $124 million remaining under this authorization as of December 31, 2021. At year-end, we had approximately $550 million of liquidity comprised of approximately $150 million of cash on hand and $400 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in May of 2026. Also, total debt outstanding for the -- at the end of the year was $980 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was only 1.2x on an as-reported basis.\nIn addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026, and we do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date. And it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026.\nFurther enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile. And for the full year 2021, free cash flow was $306 million. Uses of cash during 2021 included $744 million for acquisitions, including earnout and noncontrolling interest buyouts, $126 million for share repurchases and $110 million for capital expenditures. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation give us the flexibility to grow our business, execute on our strategy and invest in future shareholder value-enhancing opportunities.\nWith that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2022. As Aaron previously highlighted, key demand metrics for most of our product categories continue to trend strongly during the fourth quarter, leading to a further increase in backlog as we exit 2021.\nLooking into 2022, we expect significant growth in home standby generator shipments as we ramp capacity in our Trenton, South Carolina plant. We also expect strong growth from our clean energy products as the solar plus storage market continues to grow rapidly and as we launched several important new products, including PWRmicro throughout the first half of the year. We expect C&I products to continue to benefit from strong and broad-based global demand, highlighted by domestic telecom, mobile and energy management customers and several key international markets. In addition, our 2021 energy technology acquisitions are expected to contribute meaningfully to our overall growth in particular, the ecobee, Deep Sea Electronics and Off Grid Energy acquisitions.\nIn summary, we have tremendous momentum and significant visibility into our demand profile as we enter 2022. As a result of this positive top line outlook, we're initiating guidance for 2022 that anticipate significant revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Net sales are expected to increase between 32% to 36% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 5% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes shipments of residential products increased at a low 40% rate during 2022. And revenue for C&I products is expected to grow at a high-teens rate compared to the prior year.\nImportantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. As a result, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a Category 3 or higher landed hurricane. Given we are expected to be producing at capacity for home standby generators throughout the year, the upside of a major power outage event would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2022. Meaning any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage event would most likely result in incremental revenue in 2023. As Aaron previously explained, we expect to significantly reduce our backlog and lead times for home standby generators during 2022. But given the strong demand for these products, we still expect to carry a notable amount of home standby backlog into 2023.\nAs we ramp capacity for home standby and clean energy products, we're expecting a certain level of quarterly seasonality during 2022, with net sales in the first half being approximately 47% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 53% weighted. Specifically related to the first quarter, we expect first quarter 2022 shipments to be similar to fourth quarter 2021 levels with increasing residential shipments being offset by seasonal impacts for C&I products.\nLooking at our gross margin profile as we enter 2022, we anticipate cost pressures from ongoing supply chain challenges, component shortages, higher logistics costs and an overall inflationary environment to further impact gross margins in the first quarter, resulting in a sequential decline in gross margins from fourth quarter 2021 to first quarter 2022. We expect many of these inflationary pressures to progressively ease as we move through 2022 for a variety of reasons. Steel prices have come off their recent peaks, and we expect freight costs will recede during the year as supply chain bottlenecks improve. Also, the realization of multiple pricing actions that we took in 2021 will have a meaningfully positive impact on gross margins, particularly in the second half, supported by our significant backlogs that contain higher pricing levels.\nIn addition, the impact of plant start-up costs will continue to lessen as production at the new Trenton, South Carolina facility further ramps. Also, we expect to realize certain cost-reduction initiatives that began in 2021 to combat the significant increase in input costs, including important projects to improve the cost structure for certain high-volume product lines. These tailwinds should be increasingly realized on a quarterly basis as we progress through 2022. For the full year 2022, we expect pricing, easing input cost pressures during the second half and cost-reduction initiatives to more than offset the continuation of inflationary cost pressures during the first half. As a result, we expect gross margins for full year 2022 to increase modestly compared to 2021 with sequential improvements throughout the year. Specifically, from a seasonality perspective, we expect price cost headwinds to hit peak levels in the first quarter of 2022, leading to trough gross margins that are expected to be approximately 100 basis points below fourth quarter 2021 levels. We expect quarterly improvements throughout the year ultimately leading to fourth quarter 2022 gross margins recovering back to first quarter 2021 levels.\nIn addition, we continue to make significant operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth in new and existing markets. These energy technology investments and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2021 are expected to result in moderately higher operating expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year 2022 when compared to full year 2021.\nAs a result of these factors and our gross margin expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are expected to be approximately 22.0% to 23.0% compared to 23.1% reported for the full year 2021. This includes the combined impact from recent acquisitions that is expected to dilute adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 150 basis points during 2022.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly as we move through the year, primarily driven by improving gross margins throughout the year as previously discussed in detail and, to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on the expected higher sales volumes. Specifically, regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to bottom in the first quarter at approximately 250 to 300 basis points below fourth quarter 2021 levels and then improve sequentially throughout the year, returning to the mid-20% range in the fourth quarter of 2022 even when including the impact of recent acquisitions.\nAs is our normal practice, we're also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2022. As a reminder, our approximate $30 million per year tax shield that originated from the LBO transaction in 2006 fully expired at the end of 2021. As a result, 2021 was the last year that adjusted earnings will benefit from a notably lower cash income tax rate relative to the GAAP tax rate. Given that our cash tax rate is now expected to be more in line with the GAAP tax rate, we are now only going to guide to the GAAP tax rate going forward.\nFor 2022, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% to 25% as compared to the 19.7% full year cash tax rate for 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the expiration of the previously mentioned tax shield as well as lower expected share-based compensation deductions in 2022 when compared to the prior year.\nIn 2022, we expect interest expense to be approximately $41 million to $43 million, assuming no additional term loan principal payments during the year and assuming increasing LIBOR rates throughout 2022. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. And depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $56 million to $58 million in 2022 given our assumed CapEx guidance.\nGAAP intangible amortization expense in 2022 is expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million during the year. This is an increase compared to $50 million of amortization expense in 2021 due to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2021 that resulted in a significant increase in finite live intangible assets such as trade names, customer lists, patents and technology. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $31 million to $34 million for the year.\nFor full year 2022, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year. Given the very strong organic sales growth expected during 2022, we expect the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 70% to 80% for the year as a portion of cash flows will be invested in working capital to support this growth.\nOur full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to increase and be approximately 65.3 million to 65.5 million shares as compared to 64.3 million shares in 2021. Finally, this 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

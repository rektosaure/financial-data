This call is being recorded information on how to access the replay can be found on our website now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nThank you Ben and good morning, everyone.\n\nOn today's call I'd like to address three key focus areas for the quarter.\n\nFirst I will briefly touch on the 10 year financial plan update we introduced just weeks ago.\n\nSecond I will walk through our strong third quarter financial results and lastly, I'll discuss our announcement from earlier this week regarding the sale of our Ohio gas LDC.\n\nLast month, we introduced an ambitious 10 year plan focused on supporting economic development, delivering strong customer outcomes, reducing O&M through operational efficiency and driving value for our investors.\n\nOur capital investment plan of at least $65 billion is supported by some of the fastest growing demand for energy anywhere in the country.\n\nImportantly, we also have visibility to at least $10 billion of incremental capital investment opportunities over the course of the plan, particularly in Texas, given the dramatic growth the communities we serve continue to experience.\n\nSpecifically in our Houston Electric service territory, we forecast peak load demand to increase by 10 Gigawatts in 2031.\n\nThis forecasted growth would representing nearly 50% increase in peak demand over the next six years.\n\nAdditionally, through the middle of the next decade, we estimate the electric load demand on our system will double to approximately 42 gigawatts.\n\nThis level of demand will continue to support a strong investment profile.\n\nOur capital investment plan through 2030 drives a projected rate base CAGR of over 11% through the end of the decade and the potential for double digit rate base growth through the middle of the next decade.\n\nThe greater Houston area is thriving powered by what we believe is the most diverse set of growth drivers in this sector. It is not relying on any single industry and the results speak for themselves.\n\nThis growth is an aspirational, it's already here, notably throughput in our Houston electric business were up 9% year to date.\n\nThis strong growth is anchored by our surge in industrial customer class throughput, which are up over 17% quarter over quarter and up over 11% year to date.\n\nThis incredible growth provides a solid foundation for our earnings guidance specifically.\n\nSpecifically, we have strong conviction in our ability to achieve non-GAAP EPS at the mid to high end of our 7% to 9% annual growth guidance from 2026 through 2028, and 7% to 9% annually thereafter through 2035.\n\nI continue to believe we have one of the most differentiated plans in the industry because of our unique combination of the diversity and pace of electric demand growth, a derisked regulatory and financing profile.\n\nAnd our ability to continue investing affordably for the benefit of our customers.\n\nThese attributes set us apart from our peers and enable us to continue to deliver value for all our stakeholders over the next decade and beyond.\n\nNow moving to our strong third quarter financial results.\n\nThis morning, we reported non-GAAP EPS of 50 for the third quarter, representing a 60% increase over the same period last year.\n\nAs we signaled last quarter 2025 earnings reflect a more backend weighted profile for the year consistent with our return to traditional capital recovery mechanisms now that the bulk of our rate case activity is behind us.\n\nI'll, let Chris cover the details in his section, but we remain well positioned to execute on our recently increased 2025, non-GAAP EPS guidance.\n\nAs such we are reiterating our full year 2025, non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1 75 to $1 77, which would represent 9% growth over 2024 delivered results of $1 62 per share.\n\nAdditionally, we are also reiterating our 2026 non-GAAP earnings guidance, we initiated a few weeks ago. As a reminder, we are targeting at least the midpoint of $1 89 to $1 91 per share.\n\nAt the midpoint this range would represent an 8% increase over the midpoint of our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range.\n\nFurther we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid to high end of our 7% to 9% long term annual guidance range from 2026 through 2028 and.\n\n79% annually through 2035.\n\nAs a reminder, our guidance is based on actual delivered results as we continue to execute and deliver value for our shareholders each and every year.\n\nI would now like to discuss our recent announcement regarding the sale of our Ohio gas LDC.\n\nEarlier this week, we announced the signing of our higher gas LDC transaction, which is expected to generate approximately $2 $6 billion in gross proceeds representing a significant milestone and executing our 10 year financial plan the.\n\nThe strong valuation of approximately one nine times 2020 for rate base underscores the exceptional demand for U S natural gas ldcs.\n\nThis outcome once again demonstrates our ability to efficiently finance our growth investments. This time by recycling the transaction proceeds of a high quality business at nearly two times book value and reallocating capital into our remaining portfolio at one times book value.\n\nThe after tax net cash proceeds of approximately $2 4 billion will be redeployed into higher growth jurisdictions to efficiently fund our capital investment plan.\n\n. The proceeds should also provide additional flexibility and funding for future incremental capital investments.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2026, Chris will go into the details of the transaction, including the structure, which will allow us to more smoothly to redeploy capital while maintaining a strong earnings profile.\n\nIt has been a privilege to serve the customers and communities and our Ohio gas business and we are committed to a smooth transition for our customers. This is a tremendous business with fantastic employees and we know they will continue to provide great service to 335000 metered customers in Ohio.\n\nThis transaction reflects our continued commitment to disciplined capital allocation as we seek to further enable growth, especially in Texas and long term value creation for all stakeholders.\n\nOur growing capital investment opportunities are supported by accelerating and diverse set of load growth drivers. This coupled with our ability to efficiently finance. Our plan continues to support our conviction that we have one of the most tangible long term growth plans in the industry and with that I'll hand, it over to Chris.\n\nThanks, Jason.\n\nThis morning, I will address four key areas of focus.\n\nFirst I will review the details of our third quarter results.\n\nSecond I will discuss the transaction structure of the recently announced sale of our Ohio gas LDC.\n\nThird I will highlight our progress on the execution of our 2025 capital investment plan.\n\nAnd lastly, I'll provide an update on where we ended the third quarter with respect to the balance sheet.\n\nLet's now move to the financial results shown on slide five.\n\nOn a GAAP EPS basis, we reported 45 for the third quarter of 2025.\n\nOn a non-GAAP EPS basis, we reported 50 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to 31 in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOur non-GAAP results remove of charges, primarily consisting of tax true ups related to the sale of our Louisiana, and Mississippi businesses and transaction costs in connection with our announced Ohio gas LDC sale.\n\nIn addition, it removes related to our temporary generation units as these units are no longer part of our rate regulated business.\n\nThese strong results give us confidence in meeting our positively revised 2025, non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1 75 to $1 77.\n\nNow taking a closer look at the drivers of our third quarter earnings.\n\nGrowth and rate recovery, when netted with depreciation and other taxes were a favorable variance of seven when.\n\nWhen compared to the same quarter of last year.\n\nThis positive variance underscores the strength of our interim capital tracker mechanisms, which continue to support the efficient recovery of our investments.\n\nWe expect these tailwind to continue driving earnings through the remainder of the year.\n\nDuring the quarter, we filed for our second set of interim capital recovery trackers at Houston Electric.\n\nThe T cost and DCF mechanisms, which support the timely recovery of transmission and distribution investments respectively.\n\nOur T cost filings, which included a $15 million annual revenue requirement increase was approved and reflected in customer rates on October 10th.\n\nOur filing which includes a $55 million annual revenue increase is on the PUC T. Open meeting agenda for later today.\n\nWith updated rates expected to take effect in December.\n\nWeather and usage were once unfavorable when compared to the comparable quarter last year, driven by fewer outages across our Houston Electric service territory related to storm activity.\n\nO&M was 12 favorable compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThis significant improvement in O&M is primarily driven by last August vegetation management, and other storm related costs, where.\n\nWhere we spent approximately $100 million to accelerate work and improve customer outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, we had of favorability and other which is primarily driven by an income tax remeasurement.\n\nThis reflects our continued efforts to optimize our tax structure to align with the evolving composition of our portfolio, which after the closing of our Ohio transaction.\n\nWill skew more heavily towards Texas.\n\nThese favorable drivers were partially offset by a of higher interest expense and financing costs.\n\nMerrily due to incremental debt issuances since the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNext I'll go through the details of our recently announced Ohio gas LDC sale.\n\nAs many of you may have seen earlier this week, we announced the sale of our hydro gas LDC, which.\n\nWhich is expected to generate gross sale proceeds of approximately $2 six 2 billion.\n\nGarnering a multiple of nearly one nine times 2024 year end rate base.\n\nWe anticipate total net proceeds of roughly $2 4 billion after taxes and transaction costs.\n\nThis is an outstanding outcome.\n\nThis result exceeds what was contemplated in our financing plans underscore.\n\nUnderscoring the conservative approach, we take to our planning process.\n\nAs such the transaction will be accretive to both our plan and alternative financing sources.\n\nIn the near term these proceeds will serve to further strengthen our balance sheet.\n\nAnd over the long term as Jason alluded to this transaction will allow for greater financing flexibility.\n\nAnd may enable us to fund incremental capital investments with less equity and a 47% rule of thumb, we provided at our September investor update.\n\nTransaction proceeds will be redeployed into higher growth jurisdictions to support near term capital investments in our Texas electric and gas businesses.\n\nNotably after the close of this transaction, Texas will represent 70% of our investment portfolio.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, we will enter into a one year sellers note with a six 5% annual coupon, which will help support earnings in 2027.\n\nAs a reminder.\n\nLast quarter, we announced an increase to our 2025 investment plan as we continue to make targeted system enhancements.\n\nThese incremental investments will help partially offset the loss of Ohio investment upon the close of the sale.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2026, aligning with our financing plans and long term value creation goals.\n\nNext I'll touch on our capital investment plan execution through the third quarter as shown here on slide seven.\n\nFor the quarter were right on track to meet our positively revised 2025 capital investment target of $5 3 billion.\n\nIn the third quarter, we invested $1 $3 billion of base work for the benefit of our customers and communities.\n\nWhich combined with a $2 $4 billion, we invested in the first half of the year.\n\nRepresents approximately 70% of our total year target.\n\nIn short, we remain well positioned to achieve our investment targets for 2025.\n\nNow moving to an update on our balance sheet and credit metrics.\n\nAs of the end of the quarter, our trailing 12 months adjusted to debt ratio based on the Moody's rating methodology with 14%.\n\nWhen removing transitory storm related impacts.\n\nWe anticipate these credit metrics can be further improved by early next year as we expect to issue securitization bonds in connection with hurricane barrel in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nWe continue to target 100 to 150 basis points above our Moody's downgrade threshold of 13% as we remain laser focused on efficiently financing our robust capital investment plan.\n\nEarlier this month, we once again illustrated our commitment to a strong balance sheet through our $700 million junior subordinated note issuance, which provides 50% equity credit.\n\nOur common equity guide through 2030 remains unchanged at $2 $75 billion.\n\nAs a reminder, we have derisked over $1 billion of these equity needs through the forward sales, we executed earlier this year and.\n\nAnd we do not anticipate common equity needs beyond those forward sales from now through 2027.\n\nWe believe we are well positioned to execute the remainder of the year and beyond.\n\nAnd we are reaffirming our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1 75 to $1 77.\n\nWhich equates to 9% growth at the midpoint from our delivered 2024, non-GAAP EPS of $1 62.\n\nAdditionally, we are also reiterating our 2026 non-GAAP earnings guidance, we initiated a few weeks ago at our investor update from the midpoint of our new and higher 2025 range.\n\nFor 2026, we are targeting at least the midpoint of $1 89 to $1 91.\n\nAt the midpoint this would represent an 8% increase over the midpoint of our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid to high end of our 7% to 9% range from 2026 through 2028.\n\nAfter 2028, we will target growing earnings annually at 7% to 9% through 2035.\n\nWe look forward to executing our plan that delivers on the most diverse growth drivers in the country fueling economic development for years to come.\n\nAnd with that I'll now turn the call back over to Jason.\n\nThank you Chris I'm proud of the team's continued execution over the past quarter and our results have firmly put us on track to deliver our guidance this year.\n\nThis management team will work to not only execute the ambitious targets, we set forth in our new industry, leading 10 year plan, but we will also work to enhance the plan for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\n\nThanks, Jason operator, I'd now like to turn it over to Q&A.\n\nAt this time, we will begin taking questions. If you wish to ask a question. Please press star. One one are you touched on key pad the company requests that when asking a question colors pick up their telephone handsets. Thank you.\n\nOur first question is from Nick Campanella of Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nHey, good morning, Thanks for all the disclosures.\n\nGood morning, Ed.\n\nHey, good morning, I, just wanted to ask Chris you talked a little bit about it in your prepared remarks on our balance sheet capacity here from the Ohio transaction.\n\nHow are you kind of viewing it on like an to debt improvement basis versus the plan you mentioned.\n\nFinancing may be less than the 45, 47% equity assumption.\n\nIs that is that now 30 or 15 is there any kind of way to further quantify that thanks.\n\nSure Hi, Nick.\n\nIf I could just maybe take a step back.\n\nAnd as you look at the transaction, there's really a couple of things going on one is over time, you've seen us continue down this path of .\n\nreally that far.\n\nFocus on the portfolio, we are reducing also earnings in cash lag, where we can so maybe that kind of goes to that point.\n\nAs you look at the total outcome as we do sources and uses Youll, probably see us initially step into reducing the opco debt. That's there so thats roughly $800 million. If you base. It on our year end 'twenty six rate base of $1 six.\n\nAnd then as we looked at our plan overall youre, probably looking at on the order of $400 million in benefit.\n\nNet to plan.\n\nSo ultimately what that puts us in a position to do as you can imagine as we will evaluate both the improvement to the balance sheet here in the near term and then as we go forward it could allow us to deploy additional capex to the plan in an accretive way.\n\nOkay, Great I appreciate it and then just maybe on the deal just any update on how local feedback has been on the ground and reception to the deal from state leadership since it was announced.\n\nYes, good morning, Nick It's Jason Richey.\n\nhas been.\n\nGreat. So far very supportive Joe anticipate any challenges and obviously going to work with .\n\nOur counterparty to successfully transition this business continued its track record of Great service in Ohio.\n\nAlright, Thanks, a lot.\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nYes.\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJust.\n\nMaybe.\n\nJason Chris more color on the sales growth in Texas, which obviously thats very strong.\n\nJust what.\n\nWhat sectors are driving the industrial sales.\n\nSo much higher this year.\n\nGood morning, Steve Thanks for the question I think.\n\nThroughput growth quarter over quarter year over year really reflects the diversity of drivers that we have here in the greater Houston area.\n\nAlready connected this year.\n\nLoan over half a gig of data center activity.\n\nMuch of that is on the transmission sort of industrial rail side, we continue to see.\n\nVery strong demand from energy refining and processing and exports.\n\nAnd I think what we really saw that as a differentiator of this this quarter was the increase in activity at the port of Houston, which is the largest port by waterborne tonnage in the world and we saw about an 18% increase quarter over quarter.\n\nExports.\n\nSo it's really just a diversity of drivers this isn't growth that we're anticipating coming down. The line. This is growth across a number of different industries that we're experiencing today.\n\nOkay, Great. That's helpful. And then just any update on prospects of.\n\nData center activity in Indiana.\n\nI don't know if you want to share any thoughts on how you're feeling about the regulatory.\n\nThe environment in Indiana, I know you don't have any cases, there right now, but just thoughts there.\n\nYes, we continue to actively work.\n\nData center opportunities in Indiana.\n\nWell positioned to deliver on that as we've talked about in capacity.\n\nPretty uniquely positioned in the fact that we've got excess capacity today on the system that allows us to move quickly. It's an area that is very constructive both from.\n\nCost of an availability of land water et cetera, and we've just brought online our simple cycle plant that was built to be.\n\nEasily converted to combined cycle.\n\nAllow us to efficiently increase the level of capacity available. So we continue to feel good about.\n\nThe prospects of bringing.\n\nData center activity to southwest, Indiana stepping back on kind of a broader base. Yes. We are all focused on affordability of our service out there.\n\nWe like many of the other Indiana utilities.\n\nA fairly significant step up in rates last year as a result of.\n\nLong term trend.\n\nClosing some very old.\n\nGenerating facilities as we project forward, though.\n\nWe see our rates growing in line with inflation.\n\nOver the remainder of this decade.\n\nTaken some steps to help mitigate the impact we cancelled about $1 billion of.\n\nRenewable projects.\n\nWe will push out the retirement of our third and final call facility a few more years and so I think at the end of the day, we like other utilities are taking proactive steps to to make sure that we moderate the pace.\n\nRate increases, but working constructively to bring economic development activity to the state and I think that's very much aligned with.\n\nThe.\n\nState leadership.\n\n.\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with Jpmorgan Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGood morning, Jamie.\n\nHi, Chris Thanks for the comments there on the asset sale I was just wondering if it might be able to expand a little bit more sounds like a nice credit accretive properties to the final deal terms versus expectations I'm. Just wondering if you could expand a bit more I guess on whether you see this being accretive to the earnings over time or any thoughts on that.\n\nSure I think Jeremy that a couple of ways to look at this we do see it as directly beneficial to the financing plan as I mentioned in an helpful from an earnings standpoint to a thing to keep in mind is.\n\nAs we looked at the sale here of Ohio, specifically from as we reallocate spend we're going to be in a situation where were experiencing 25% to 30% less.\n\nLess cash lag.\n\nJust on a historical basis, so I think thats certainly helpful as well going forward, we'll be putting those dollars to work as Jason mentioned.\n\nCurrently heavily in our Texas gas electric business, including in a set of Texas gas projects that we're excited about really for years to come where it really is a great business as you know coming out of the rate case last year. There. So I think well positioned both financing wise and from an earnings standpoint keep in mind.\n\nI alluded to this in my prepared remarks, but were just emphasize here too as we're stepping into making sure that.\n\nWe were managing any otherwise earnings impact.\n\nWe've already deployed about $500 million this year that we expressed in our plan.\n\nKeep in mind as I mentioned earlier this is about $1 six year end 'twenty six rate base. So you should assume that we're also going to accelerate another roughly $1 billion in 2026 that means net here, we're going to fully replace that rate base, but at the beginning of 2027, so overall positions us well going forward.\n\nThat's very helpful. Thanks, and just one more I guess on the.\n\nSellers note.\n\nTrout.\n\nAs you guys are receiving in the deal as far as how you think about.\n\nHow that helps facilitate the plan and what value that brings to centerpoint here being able to layer that in and how that allows you to I guess too.\n\nManage earnings.\n\nGoing forward, but it sounds like the capital.\n\nPlan is he said really is that as a big offset there.\n\nYes, certainly from a capital allocation plan, we've been pre funding thoughtfully, what I would say on the seller note is it's a pretty straightforward instrument, there, where we will have that opportunity for the second year for 2027, having that six 5% coupon associated with it on just over $1 billion and so.\n\nAllows us again to have good clarity would also settled on a quarterly basis, I think which is nice too. So there's no real lag there so straightforward instrument one that.\n\nHelpful component of the plan as well.\n\nGot it I'll leave it there thank you.\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\n\nThank you.\n\nLast question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nHey, good morning team. Thank you guys very much I appreciate it.\n\nGood morning Julien.\n\nHey, Good morning, Hey, Jason quickly a couple of things to follow up on first off I know you alluded to it a few weeks ago here, but.\n\nHow do you think about the Armani and rollout and the timeline on that front I mean, certainly it seems like this is a multi year project here, but certainly within the scope of the five year plan. How do you think about the cadence of that rolling in when do we start to get some visibility around that and contributions.\n\nYes, Julian Thanks for the question.\n\nThis next generation.\n\nAlly.\n\nInvestments.\n\nReally we'll start.\n\nAnd in our plan in 2006, maybe taking a step back for a second as we released the new $65 billion.\n\n10 year Capex plan, we identified.\n\nMore than $10 billion of upside I would consider one of these projects.\n\nOne of the one of the upside opportunities to that plan.\n\nComing back to the timing of the most important thing that we can do.\n\nRun a pilot in 2006 to prove the use case and benefits for our customers.\n\nAnd then I would really look at that once we have that pilot in and making a filing with the.\n\nPSEG and really starting to kind of work this project.\n\nAnd our earnings beginning in 2027 and beyond and again, there are very real benefits for our customers as we've talked about in the past.\n\nWhen we experienced winter storm yuriy because of the generation of meters. We had at the time, we could not use those meters for load shed related activities instead, we add too.\n\nLoad at the circuit level.\n\nNext generation.\n\nSmart meters would allow us to do that at home and I think would allow us to be much more targeted.\n\nAnd allow for even more rolling of power.\n\nWinter storm area was to occur against a number of benefits.\n\nOur customers, we need to prove those out with a pilot in 2006.\n\nLook towards more fulsome deployments beginning in 2007.\n\nExcellent. Thank you for that and then if I could pivot in a slightly different direction, obviously kudos on the transaction here is the other item if I were to think about like what's not in terms of included in the formal guidance on cash flows as mobile Jan I perceive at the economics and price points, there continue to improve as.\n\nEvidenced by.\n\nSome of the folks out there like for me talking about this but how would you characterize.\n\nToday.\n\nWhere you are around that and the opportunities that exist.\n\nMore of the longer term, obviously is that it's less committed.\n\nIn terms of the existing units and your exposure to some of that improved market pricing.\n\nYes, there's really two aspects to that Julien Theres first we've got what we call medium sized units just a little bit larger than five megawatts of PS five units five megawatts a piece of that.\n\nSure.\n\nCurrently.\n\nWe have the ability to market and are actively doing that.\n\nMarket for those units remains.\n\nstrong and would be a potential cash flow tailwind in the plan.\n\nOn a larger basis, we have 15 units that are roughly kind of call them 30 megawatts of piece.\n\nBetter now actively supporting the grant outside of San Antonio until either kind of late 2006.\n\nEarly 27 at the latest at which time, then we will be able to remarket those units as.\n\nAs you said the market remains strong if anything is improving modestly that will become a.\n\nOur cash flow tailwind when we can release those units from the support of the aircraft grade in San Antonio in every market that was again.\n\nProbably likely around spring of 2007.\n\nWe continue to work with brokers.\n\nThird parties to keep a pulse on the market and think about how we can kind of derisked can take advantage of.\n\nThis growth, but obviously more to come here.\n\n.\n\nQuarters unfold as we get closer to those.\n\nReally service units.\n\nExcellent sorry, and Thats, a nitpick what final detail here HB for three or four right. So thats your peers in the state your gas utilities has kind of been talking a good bit about this.\n\nI know that you all in the in the interim of talk up even more gas investments in your plan a few weeks ago.\n\nIs the scope of the contribution from that legislation.\n\nFully included in the plan and to what extent is there is there anything else that we should be considering here given your expanded investment in gas in recent weeks.\n\nYes, we think that that was a very constructive.\n\nPisa legislation to help sort of reduce regulatory lag.\n\nWhat I would say is the benefit of that legislation is incorporated in the plan that we released with respect to.\n\nThe investments that we have identified.\n\nAs we continue to look at enhancing their plan.\n\nAnd we've alluded to the.\n\n10 billion plus outside there is opportunity as we fall gas related capital in that.\n\nYes.\n\nPlant should be enhanced further with with the benefit of that legislation. So partially in the plan has the opportunity to be improved as we as we put more capital in.\n\nGot it alright, well, we'll stay tuned there alright ill leave it there. Thank you guys very much have a great day.\n\nThanks Julien.\n\nThanks, Jason Operator. This concludes our call. Thank you all for joining.\n\nThis concludes Centerpoint Energy's third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation."

Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'd like to address 4 key areas of focus. First, I will touch on our second quarter financial results. Second, I'll provide an update on the strong growth that our Houston Electric Service territory continues to experience fueled by a diverse set of economic drivers. Third, I'll touch on our recent announcement to efficiently recycle proceeds through the proposed sale of our Ohio gas LDC. And lastly, I'll discuss today's announced $500 million increase to our capital investment plan, which will be deployed this year.\nToday's added customer-driven investments represent our third capital increase this year, now totaling $5.5 billion. Importantly, these increases to our capital investment plans will be funded without the issuance of incremental common equity. Now starting with our second quarter financial results. This morning, we announced non-GAAP EPS of $0.29 for the second quarter. Combined with our reported first quarter non-GAAP EPS, we are approximately 46% of the weight of the midpoint of our full year earnings guidance range of $1.74 to $1.76.\nThis quarter's earnings are in line with our expectations for the first half of 2025. As we discussed on our first quarter call, we anticipated earning 40% to 50% of the full year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the first half of this year. In short, we are right on track. As such, we are reaffirming our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.74 to $1.76 which equates to 8% earnings growth at the midpoint from our delivered 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62. Over the long term, we continue to expect a non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% range annually through 2030. We also expect to grow dividends per share in line with the earnings growth over the same period.\nNow I want to provide an update on our strong load growth outlook for the Houston Electric service territory, which continues to be catalyzed by a discrete and diverse set of economic drivers. Over the previous 2 quarters, we have shared the drivers of the substantial growth opportunities ahead. By 2031 alone, we expect a forecasted peak load increase of 10 gigawatts which represents a nearly 50% increase in peak demand on our system over the next 6 years. We have strong conviction in this forecast as we've made conservative assumptions related to the projects and our low interconnection queue.\nNotably, since our first quarter call, our load interconnection queue has grown by 6 gigawatts or more than 12%. What differentiates this potential increase is that it continues to be propelled by a diverse set of drivers, including data centers, advanced manufacturing, energy development and energy exports. Together with the 7 gigawatt increase we discussed in our first quarter call, this additional 6 gigawatts of growth results in a cumulative increase of over 30% to what we included in our ERCOT load filing we made earlier this year. At this time, we are not formally increasing our load forecast above the nearly 50% growth target by the end of the decade.\nHowever, these positive trends in customer demand only serve to reinforce our confidence in our growth forecasts. Most importantly, this growth is already beginning to materialize when observing year-over-year sales trends. Through the first half of this year, weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales were up 8% when compared to the first half of 2024. The growth we're currently experiencing in addition to the significant growth we are forecasting requires the construction and regional build-out of our electric transmission system that we will begin executing on in the near term. To fund this exponential growth in our Houston Electric service territory, we have continued to evaluate the most efficient forms of financing.\nThis, along with the timing needs for growth-driven capital ultimately led to our announcement of our Ohio Gas LDC sales process kick off during the quarter. I would like to share some additional color around our decision to efficiently recycle capital through the proposed sale of our Ohio Gas LDC. I want to begin by saying that these decisions are never easy. We value this constructive jurisdiction and our rate employees that execute and deliver for our Ohio gas customers every day. However, as our Houston Electric and Texas gas jurisdictions continue to experience increased and accelerated growth, we have decided to shift our strategic focus even more towards Texas.\nIn connection with the shift, we believe the proposed sale of our Ohio Gas business makes sense at this time, principally for 3 reasons. First, the sale will allow us to efficiently recycle cash proceeds to support our continually increasing investment programs. We have previously demonstrated our ability to monetize assets above book value and efficiently reinvest those funds back into our regulated business. This transaction is yet another opportunity that we believe we can execute to finance our increasing capital needs efficiently. Second, we anticipate that the sale of the Ohio Gas business will allow us to reprioritize nearly $1 billion of capital expenditures through 2030 to support our Texas jurisdictions.\nThis reprioritization of $1 billion will help support the ongoing set of customer and community needs in Texas. In addition, we anticipate that the investing of these proceeds will result in a higher consolidated cash return in the future. We believe improved cash flow profile will allow us to more efficiently self-fund our future investments and potentially allow us to rely less on common equity issuances. Third is we look to optimize our portfolio, it makes sense for us to focus our time and resources in jurisdictions where we have both gas and electric service or we have a larger customer presence.\nWe anticipate that the recycling of cash proceeds from the sale of our Ohio Gas business. In addition to this reallocation it will result in Texas constituting over 70% of our portfolio after the close of the sale. The proposed sale of our Ohio Gas business and our derisked quite through 2027, which Chris will touch on in his section, has allowed us to increase our capital investment plan by $5.5 billion since the beginning of this year. All of these increases are anticipated to be funding without incremental common equity. In addition, we believe any further increases to our capital plan this year can be achieved without the need for additional common equity.\nI now want to discuss the $500 million increase to our 2025 capital investment plan, which, as I mentioned, is on top of the $5 billion of increases already announced this year. The $500 million increase announced today will be invested in 2025 as we continue to make targeted system enhancements for the benefit of our customers. This increased capital investment will also help partially offset the loss of Ohio investments upon the closing of the sale. As I discussed earlier, our forecasted low growth will necessitate significant investments in our transmission system in both the near and longer term.\nTo address these forecasted needs, we are taking a leading role with peer utilities in ERCOT to advance the key planning studies and proposed projects that will help us enable the tremendous economic development in the eastern part of Texas. Through our own work with ERCOT's regional planning group, in addition to our own internal work, we have identified approximately 200 projects that we will look to execute over the next 10 years. We believe we are well positioned to execute these projects over this relatively short period of time.\nUnlike many other transmission systems, we have a significant number of brownfield opportunities where existing transmission structures are already in place reducing construction costs and increasing speed to energization. Although we've already significantly increased our capital investment plan this year with our plan now at $53 billion through 2030. We have 3 significant investment drivers outside of electric transmission that continue to reinforce an upward bias to our capital investment plan. The first of these opportunities is related to furthering our resiliency-based work as we aspire to be the most resilient coastal grid in the country.\nOver the last 12 months, we've made targeted assist improvements through our Greater Houston Resiliency initiative, which have already yielded improved outcomes for our customers. Notably, through May of this year, the average duration of outages, our Houston Electric customers experience has gone down nearly half as compared to the comparable period in 2024. This is a significant improvement and we are proud of our teams and our field crews focus on executing on our system automation strategy and pole replacement program at such an accelerated pace. However, we know there's still more work to be done.\nWith this in mind, we still see incremental resiliency capital investment opportunities through the end of the decade that go well beyond our current system resiliency plan, which will likely run through 2028. Chris will discuss the progress we've made on our current related regulatory filings in this section. The second driver of incremental capital investments I want to highlight is related to the revitalization of downtown Houston, which our plan does not currently include. This work will require substantial investments to support both growth and modernization of our underground electric system and our substations that support the downtown area as the city is in the process of undertaking a very exciting set of infrastructure plans to dramatically change the downtown landscape.\nThe third driver of potential incremental investments is in our Texas Gas service territory. that we've previously mentioned on our first quarter call. This relates to the opportunity to build a high-pressure distribution system in our Texas gas business, which currently relies on a series of contracts that are more costly for customers to move our owned gas throughout the greater Houston region. We're excited to share more about these capital investment opportunities later in the third quarter when we plan to provide a new comprehensive 10-year plan.\nWe continue to believe that we have 1 of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry. The growth of our businesses have continued to experience has resulted in $5.5 billion of increased capital investment so far this year, including the $500 million increase we announced this quarter. Even with these announced increases, we believe there is still further upside to our capital investment plan that runs through 2030. Our ability to efficiently fund our plan has allowed us to take our capital investment plan from $47.5 billion at the end of 2024 to $53 billion without introducing additional common equity.\nIn addition, we have derisked our modest common equity needs through 2027 through executing a forward sale of our common equity earlier in the second quarter. We believe we are well positioned with tailwinds exceeding headwinds, and we are excited to share a refreshed comprehensive 10-year plan by the end of the third quarter of this year.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. This morning, I plan to cover 4 areas of focus. First, the details of our second quarter results Second, I'll touch on our regulatory progress through the first half of this year, including our recently announced proposed settlement in our Ohio gas rate case. Third, I'll discuss our progress on the execution of our 2025 capital investment plan, including our $500 million increase, bringing our 10-year plan to $53 billion, which we will fund without issuing incremental common equity. And finally, I'll provide an update on where we ended the second quarter with respect to the balance sheet and how we're thinking about the future financing of our capital investments in light of the proposed sale of our Ohio Gas LDC.\nLet's now move to the financial results shown on Slide 8. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.30 for the second quarter of 2025. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.29 for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2024. Our non-GAAP EPS results for the second quarter removed the impacts from the sale of the Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs. As Jason alluded to and as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we anticipated a more back-weighted shape to our 2025 earnings profile this year. As a reminder, this earnings profile is primarily driven by the different cadence of capital recovery as we were unable to access certain interim capital recovery mechanisms during our various rate case proceedings in the first half of the year.\nSlide 9 depicts our expectations for the remainder of the year. Now taking a closer look at the quarter. Growth in rate recovery netted with depreciation and other taxes was an unfavorable variance of $0.01 when compared to the same quarter last year. Again, this is largely driven by the off cadence filings of our interim capital tracker mechanisms. Weather and usage were a favorable $0.01 when compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. The largest impact here was from our Houston Electric service territory, which has experienced a warmer start to 2025, and as compared to slightly milder weather in the second quarter of 2024. O&M was $0.03 unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2024.\nLike the first quarter, this unfavorable variance was largely driven by timing of vegetation management and other activities, which we accelerated to be ready ahead of the official start of the 2025 hurricane season. With much of this work moved into the first half of the year as compared to a more ratable work schedule in prior years, we anticipate this unfavorability to reverse over the second half of the year. In addition, interest expense and financing costs were $0.03 unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2024. These $0.03 were primarily driven by the increased debt issuances since the second quarter of last year, some of which were slightly higher coupon junior subordinated notes, given our focus on the balance sheet and emphasis on credit supportive instruments.\nLastly, as you may recall, last year, we issued $500 million of common equity. $250 million of these issuances were a pull forward from 2025 as we sought to strengthen our balance sheet after our storm restoration. These equity issuances resulted in an unfavorable variance of $0.01 quarter-over-quarter. Next, I'll briefly touch on our regulatory progress, starting with our Ohio Gas rate case settlement. As many of you may have seen 2 weeks ago, we reached a proposed settlement in our Ohio gas rate case. The settlement agreement includes a revenue requirement increase of $59.6 million based on an equity ratio of 52.9% and return on equity of 9.85%.\nWe began hearing earlier this week and anticipate those hearings continuing through the end of next week. We look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders in this case to reach a reasonable outcome for all parties. Moving now to Houston Electric. I'll begin with our system resiliency plan filing where we recently reached an all-party settlement. The proposed settlement includes distribution system resiliency investments and spend of approximately $3.2 billion over the next 3 years. There are 3 categories of investment included in this figure, an acceleration of our polar placement program, undergrounding with vulnerable areas of our system and automation and increased resiliency of distribution circuits and substations.\nIn addition to those investments, the proposed settlement also includes certain noninvestment activities for which we will receive a deferral related to the spend. Most notably, the proposed settlement provides for $140 million of vegetation management, which will allow us to defer costs associated with our industry-leading plan to reduce our cycle from 5 years to 3 years for the benefit of our customers. Proposed $3.2 billion included in the settlement represents a reduction of approximately $2.5 billion from the $5.75 billion included in our January filing. The primary driver of this reduction is the removal of transmission-related investments we included in our filing.\nWe thought it was important to include these investments in our initial filing to present a comprehensive picture of how we're approaching resiliency investments to improve outcomes for our customers. However, in settlement discussions, -- we agreed with stakeholders that these investments are better considered outside of the system residency plan process. To be clear, we still intend on executing important transmission system hardening work. Over the last few years, we've made many investments to improve the backbone of the system by investing approximately $1 billion.\nWith much of that work already completed, we anticipate fully achieving our initial hardening targets on our transmission system within the next 10 years. We want to thank all stakeholders for engaging in constructive discussions about the resiliency investments that will help improve outcomes for customers in the Greater Houston area. We anticipate the PUCT to vote on this proposed settlement agreement by the end of the third quarter.\nNext, I'll move to storm cost recovery filings starting with the Hurricane Beryl filing. Just this week, we started a set of mediated discussions with all parties to the case, and they are currently hearing scheduled on the cost recovery request at the end of this month. Moving to our process to recover costs associated with last year's May storms. As a reminder, we have fully settled this request and now have received an approved financing order.\nOur next step is we will seek to issue these bonds in the third quarter of this year. We will continue to work with all stakeholders in connection with the storm cost recovery filings in advance of the securitization of these costs, which is beneficial for our customers.\nNext, I'll touch on our capital investment plan execution through the second quarter and our positively revised capital plan through 2030, as shown here on Slide 10. As Jason mentioned, today, we are increasing our 2025 and 10-year capital investment plan by $500 million without anticipating any need for additional common equity. This represents our third capital plan increase this year. bringing our total 2025 increases to $5.5 billion with our total plan through 2030 now at $53 billion. And as Jason indicated, cumulatively, $5.5 billion comes without any anticipated increases to our common equity guidance through 2030.\nAs a reminder, our equity needs still stand at $2.75 billion through the end of the decade, of which over 1/3 has been derisked through our forward equity sales. Today's announced investment increase will help further support the accelerated economic growth investments that we continue to execute in our Texas gas and electric service territory to move at pace for our customers. I want to be clear that even with the increases or announced this year, we continue to see strong tailwinds to support further enhancements to our capital investment plans.\nWe are excited to aggregate all of these updates as well as provide others to give everyone a comprehensive update, a new 10-year plan later third quarter of this year. For the quarter, we are right on track to meet our positively revised 2025 capital investment target of $5.3 billion. Through the first half of 2025, we invested $2.4 billion of base work for the benefit of our customers and communities. Finally, I will provide an overview of how we're thinking about the financing of our $5.5 billion of capital investment increases and touch on where our credit metrics are currently tracking. We continue to explore the most efficient forms of financing to fund the incredible growth our businesses continue to experience.\nDuring the quarter, we made significant strides towards both addressing and derisking our future equity financing plans. We did this by announcing the proposed sale of our Ohio gas LDC with the intent of recycling the proceeds back into our Texas businesses, executing additional forward sales under our ATM program, which totaled $165 million for the first half of the year and executing $920 million of a forward sale of common equity to be settled by the end of February 2027. As Jason highlighted, we have made a strategic decision to allocate more capital to our high-growth businesses in Texas and recycle capital through the proposed sale of our Ohio Gas LDC business.\nThe proceeds from this transaction are intended to support the funding of the $5.5 billion increases we have already announced this year. With additional progress in our oil rate case proceeding, we anticipate having a transaction signed by the end of the year with the closing expected by the end of next year. I want to be clear that we view this transaction similarly to the others we have executed. This sale will not result in making a downward revision in our earnings guidance.\nToday's announced $500 million increase to the 2025 capital plan will help partially offset the investments we have made previously in our Ohio Gas business. In addition to the announcement related to our Ohio Gas business, we were able to derisk our planned equity issuances for 2026 and 2027 through forward sales of our common equity and with the execution of $165 million of forward sales under our ATM program and $920 million through our [indiscernible] transaction we have been able to satisfy our anticipated comedy equity needs for both 26 and 2027.\nNow moving to an update on our credit metrics. As of the end of the quarter, our trailing 12 adjusted FFO to debt ratio based on the Moody's rating methodology was 14.1%. And when removing transitory storm-related costs. Much like our historical profile, we anticipate our credit metrics to strengthen throughout the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we anticipate receiving nearly $400 million in securitization proceeds related to the May storms in the third quarter of this year. In addition, in light of the progress in the Hurricane Beryl storm securitization process I highlighted a moment ago, we expect to receive nearly $1.3 billion of proceeds by the end of the year or early next year.\nAlso, as we mentioned on our first quarter call, with the bulk of our rate cases now complete, we anticipate a 5% improvement to our operating cash flow beginning next year. We expect this cash flow to allow us to more efficiently self-fund capital investments for the bit of customers. This same operating cash flow improvement helps fund today's $500 million announced increase without any anticipated need for incremental common equity. And although we are not formally changing our guide regarding incremental investments requiring funding with 50% equity and 50% debt.\nThis new operating cash flow profile may provide financing flexibility to reduce that ratio in the future. With the anticipated receipt of the combined $1.7 billion of securitization proceeds, in addition to improved operating cash flow, we remain confident that we will exit 2025 with a 100 to 150 basis point cushion above our downgrade threshold without the need for common equity issuances. With the first half of 2025 in the books, we are right on plan to deliver our full year results. We are reaffirming our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.74 to $1.76 which equates to 8% growth at the midpoint from our delivered 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62.\nOver the long term, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of the 6% to 8% range annually through 2030. We also expect to grow dividends per share in line with earnings growth over the same period of time. We look forward to the second half of 2025 and executing for the benefit of all stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over back to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Chris. I'm proud of our team's continued execution over the past quarter and the results that put us firmly on track to deliver on our financial guidance this year. We are looking forward to sharing our 10-year plan refresh later this quarter. I believe that this refresh plan will reflect our confidence in our exciting growth prospects ahead and why we have such strong conviction that we have one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry."

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Jackie Richert, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert?\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to CenterPoint's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Jason Wells, our CEO; and Chris Foster, our CFO, will discuss the company's first quarter results.\nManagement will discuss certain topics that contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are currently based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based on various factors as noted within our Form 10-Q and other SEC filings as well as our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements.\nWe reported $0.45 of earnings per share for the first quarter of 2025 on a GAAP basis. Management will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. When providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of diluted adjusted earnings per share. On a consolidated basis, referred to as non-GAAP EPS.

We use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'd like to address four key areas of focus. First, I'll touch on our first quarter financial results. Second, I will discuss the improvements we have made in advance of the upcoming hurricane season in support of our goal to build and operate the most resilient coastal grade of the country. Third, I'll provide a brief update on our regulatory progress through the first quarter and touch on a few recent filings at Houston Electric. And lastly, I'll provide an update on the continued significant and diversified load growth in our Houston Electric service territory, which is driving an increase of $1 billion to our capital investment plan through 2030.\nNow starting with our first quarter results. This morning, we announced non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 for the first quarter. As a quick reminder, and as Chris will cover in more detail, I want to emphasize that our incremental revenue from capital recovery mechanisms will be more weighted to the second half of the year as we were unable to access those mechanisms consistent with our historical schedules last year, given our rate case activity. We anticipated this profile when we initiated our guidance, and we are reaffirming our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.74 to $1.76 which equates to 8% growth at the midpoint from our delivery 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62.\nOver the long term, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% range annually through 2030. We also expect to grow dividend per share in line with earnings growth over the same period of time. I would like to now discuss the improvements we have made in advance of the upcoming hurricane season. As many of you recall, immediately after Hurricane Barrel, we introduced our Greater Houston resiliency initiative to significantly accelerate resiliency investments to reduce the number of outages during extreme weather events as well as to help restore service more quickly when those outages occur. I'm proud of the progress our crews have made. By June 1, we will double the number of grid automation devices on our system. We've replaced 26,000 poles designed to withstand extreme winds and trim or remove over 6,000 miles of high-risk vegetation since we launched this initiative last August.\nIt is important to note that much of this work is being performed in parallel with our base workload plan. In fact, taking all together, we will have completed what amounts to an extra 1.5 years of work on top of our base work plan in the last 9 months. I want to thank the team here at CenterPoint for acting with urgency to improve customer outcomes as we head into the 2025 hurricane season. We remain committed to working towards our goal of being the most resilient coastal grid in the country.\nNow turning to my third key area of focus, a brief overview of our regulatory progress, including some recent filings at Houston Electric. Before I touch on any specific regulatory filing, I want to put into perspective what our teams have accomplished over the last 18 months.\nLast year, five of our now seven service territories were subject to a rate case proceeding that represented nearly 90% of our enterprise rate base. As of today, we have received final orders in three and are now awaiting another for our Minnesota gas business, where we've already reached an all-party settlement. After the conclusion of the last rate case for our Ohio gas business, we expect that over 80% of our enterprise rate base will not be subject to a general rate case proceeding for about another 4 years. This significantly derisked regulatory profile provides a solid foundation for our financial plan through the remainder of the decade.\nI now want to briefly touch on a few filings in our Houston Electric service territory. Chris will provide updates on filings in our other jurisdictions in his section. I'll start with our most recent filing related to our temporary generation units. Last week, we made a filing to remove the unamortized rate base of our large temporary generation units. As a result, average residential customers will see a reduction in their electric delivery charges, which, over time, will equate to a monthly savings of up to $2. This plan was publicly supported by several key stakeholders at a recent legislative hearing.\nSecond, I want to provide an update on our system resiliency plan filing. As you may recall, we refiled our system resiliency plan at the end of January. The contents of that filing were informed broadly by our extensive stakeholder engagement after Hurricane Barrel. We heard loud and clear that our stakeholders wanted a more resilient grade delivered at an accelerated pace. We believe the investments included in our updated filing are responsive to that feedback as well as the feedback we've received from interveners from our initial filing. We look forward to further discussing the merits of our plan during a mutually agreed to mediation, which is scheduled for next week. Absent any settlement in this docket, the PUCT has a statutory deadline of mid-September due to shows final order.\nLastly, I want to touch upon our upcoming cost determination filing related to the storm cost recovery for Hurricane Barrel and other storms. Within the next 2 weeks, we anticipate making our cost determination filing to seek recovery of the $1.1 billion of cost incurred to restore over 2 million outages as a result of Hurricane Barrel. In addition, this filing will also include approximately $100 million of restoration costs related to two subsequent storms. Approximately 90% of the hurricane barrel related costs are related to 2,000 CenterPoint frontline personnel and nearly 13,000 mutual aid workers who travel from approximately 30 states over a 9-day period. Notably, their work led to restoration times that were in line or better than other Texas peers as well as peers outside of Texas that experienced similarly damaging storms.\nThe securitization mechanism for Texas utilities continues to be an important and constructive storm cost recovery tool for both customers and utilities. It mitigates the customer bill impact of system damage from severe weather while also providing liquidity to utilities to continue to efficiently fund capital investments for the benefit of c customers. We look forward to working with stakeholders towards a constructive resolution of this upcoming filing. As I mentioned, Chris will cover the details of our other regulatory filings in his section. Finally, I want to discuss the recent load growth trends in our Houston Electric service territory, and provide some additional color on the $1 billion increase to our capital investment plan through 2030. As you may recall on our last quarter call, we outlined what we believe to be a conservative forecast of a 10 gigawatt increase by 2031, in peak load on our Houston Electric system.\nWe continue to see positive trends that only bolster our confidence in this forecasted load growth figure. Notably, since we submitted our forecast to ERCOT at the end of January, our load interconnection queue has grown by another 7 gigawatts through 2031. This represents a nearly 20% increase in load interconnection requests in a little more than 2 months. This significant increase is driven by a diverse set of load growth factors, including industrial customer demand, data centers and transportation electrification projects.\nAt this time, we are not increasing our forecast of a peak load increase of 10 gigawatts by 2031, which as a reminder, represents about a 50% increase in peak demand on our system over the next 6 years. However, these new data points provide us even stronger conviction in our submitted forecasts. This tremendous growth potential will undoubtedly require additional capital investment in the electric transmission system which, as we alluded to in our fourth quarter call, we believe to be at least an incremental $3 billion of capital investment by the end of the decade with likely more thereafter.\nWhile the total forecasted capital investment and exact timing are still being refined and will be influenced by the PUCT recommendation on the high-voltage standard. We plan to incorporate the increased capital investment in our guidance over the course of this year, starting with today's increase of $1 billion. This initial $1 billion increase in our capital investment guidance, which now takes our total investment plan to $48.5 billion through 2030. Reflects nearly a dozen transmission projects we will be submitting to ERCOT's regional planning group in the coming weeks.\nWe will continue working with stakeholders on the final transmission voltage standard and anticipating providing additional updates to our capital investment guidance over the next 2 quarters. In addition to these electric transmission investment opportunities, we continue to see a robust set of incremental capital investment opportunities in our Houston Electric service territory as well as other jurisdictions.\nIn Houston Electric, we see the potential capital investment opportunities as we partner with the city of Houston on its downtown revitalization program, which will require substantial investment to support both growth and modernization of our underground electric system in our downtown substations. We will also evaluate additional resiliency investments towards the latter part of the decade as we continue to aim to be the most resilient coastal bread in the United States. We also have a number of incremental capital investment opportunities outside of our Houston Electric business. One example relates to our Texas gas business, which relies on third parties to move our owned gas throughout the greater Houston region.\nWe believe there's an investment opportunity to build a localized high-pressure distribution network around the city of Houston, similar to what we've constructed in our Minnesota gas service territory that could result in significant savings for our customers. Investments related to this project will likely begin next year and extend well into the next decade. We are excited to share more about all of these capital investment opportunities in the third quarter of this year when we plan to provide a new comprehensive 10-year plan. These examples of capital investment opportunities across our business further strengthens our conviction that we have one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry. We believe that the growth in Houston Electric service territory in combination with the capital investment opportunities in our other businesses will continue to drive growth for years to come.\nEqually important, this growth will also provide a sustainable platform for our customers whose charges will continue to benefit from the ever-growing population and economic activity. We are privileged to serve all of the communities across our 4-state footprint, and we continue to focus on executing for the benefits of our customers and all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. This morning, I will plan to cover four areas of focus. First, the details of our first quarter results and how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. Second, I'll touch on the regulatory progress we've made across the various states that we have the privilege to serve. Third, I'll discuss our progress on the execution of the 2025 capital investment plan and our positively revised capital investment plan through 2030. And finally, I'll provide an update on where we ended the first quarter with respect to the balance sheet and credit metrics.\nLet's now move to the financial results shown on Slide 6. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.45 for the first quarter of 2025. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.53 for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2024. Our non-GAAP EPS results for the first quarter removed the book loss resulting from the sale of Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs. As part of the sale, $217 million of goodwill was disposed. This was the reason for the book loss associated with the transaction.\nNow taking a closer look at the quarter, growth in rate recovery contributed $0.03 when compared to the same quarter last year. I want to take a moment to discuss why this figure is lower than what you've seen in our previous first quarter earnings walk. As a reminder, during 2024, we were prosecuting five separate rate cases. And due to this, we were unable to recover our capital investments on our normal filing rhythm of traditional interim recovery mechanisms. In some cases, such as the distribution and transmission capital trackers at Houston Electric, these filings were delayed several months from when they were traditionally filed. In other instances, such as the [ GRIP ] filing at Texas Gas, we were unable to file for recovery of capital investments for over a year. The filings we made during the first quarter represented a catch-up of capital investment recovery and represent nearly $2.2 billion of capital investments made in 2024 and nearly $260 million of associated revenue requirement increases.\nOver the next few months, rates will be updated and the associated earnings will begin to materialize. As such, you should expect a lower earnings profile in the first half of 2025 primarily due to these timing differences. Slide 7 depicts our expectation for the earnings shape for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we expect a more back-weighted earnings profile than in typical in our non post rate case year. As Jason mentioned, this shape was known at the time we initiated guidance, and we are confident in our ability to execute through the remainder of the year.\nComing back to the quarter. weather and usage was a favorable $0.05 when compared to the comparable quarter of 2024 as Texas and Indiana, both had more seasonably normal weather as compared to the milder weather of Q1 2024. O&M was $0.02 unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2024. This was primarily driven by the timing of work as we sought to accelerate our vegetation management work ahead of the official start of the 2025 hurricane season. In addition, interest expense and financing costs were $0.04 unfavorable when compared to the first quarter in 2024. These $0.04 were primarily driven by the approximately $3.4 billion of net new debt issuances since the first quarter of last year, some of which were slightly higher coupon junior subordinated notes given our focus on the balance sheet and emphasis on credit supportive instruments.\nLastly, as you may recall, last year, we issued $500 million of common equity. $250 million of these issuances were a pull forward from 2025 as we sought to strengthen our balance sheet after storm restoration. These equity issuances resulted in an unfavorable variance of $0.02 quarter-over-quarter.\nNext, I'll briefly touch on our regulatory progress related to the interim capital recovery trackers we filed during the quarter, starting with Houston Electric. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we had a number of interim filings that we filed outside of our normal cadence. The distribution capital recovery tracker or DCRF, was one such filing. We filed the first of our two allowed for the year at the end of February with a requested revenue requirement increase of approximately $123 million. This filing incorporates capital investments made between January and December of last year and was updated for revenues otherwise recovered in our Houston Electric case. We expect that customer delivery charges will be updated later in June.\nIn addition to the distribution capital tracker filing, we also filed for the first of our two allowed transmission recovery tracker filings or TCOS. This filing included a revenue requirement increase of approximately $64 million, which was recently approved with rates anticipated to be updated in the coming weeks. And moving now to Texas Gas. In mid-February, we filed our annual capital investment recovery mechanism, or GRIP, which included a revenue requirement increase of approximately $71 million. I'd like to highlight that this is another one of the interim recovery mechanisms that we were unable to file last year as we prosecuted the Texas Gas rate case.\nThe $71 million revenue request is larger than previous GRIP filings as it incorporates 15 months of capital investments for which we are seeking recovery rather than the traditional 12 months. We anticipate customer gas delivery charges will be updated to reflect the new revenue requirement associated with this filing by early June.\nNext, I'll touch on our capital investment plan execution through the first quarter and our positively revised capital plan through 2030 as shown here on Slide 8. In the first quarter of 2025, we invested $1.3 billion of base work for the benefit of our customers and communities. In short, we are right on track to meet our 2025 capital investment target of $4.8 billion.\nLooking further ahead, and as Jason mentioned, today, we are increasing our capital investment plan that runs through 2030 and by $1 billion from $47.5 billion to now $48.5 billion. We intend to finance these incremental investments in line with our previously communicated rule of thumb, of 50% equity and 50% debt. To be clear, however, we are not updating this year's equity plans as we still do not intend to issue common equity. That's because we pulled forward our 2025 equity base plan needs last year.\nToday's capital investment increase is one of our first steps in a planned effort to sustainably increase our capital investment plan to support the rapid and significant growth the Greater Houston area continues to experience. Over the next 2 quarters, you should expect incremental updates regarding CapEx and associated financing. Later in Q3 of this year, we will be in a position to aggregate all of these updates as well as provide others to you to give you all a comprehensive update and a new 10-year plan.\nFinally, I want to touch on how we're thinking about the balance sheet and where we ended the quarter with respect to our credit metrics. As of the end of the quarter, our trailing 12-month adjusted FFO to debt ratio based on the Moody's rating methodology was 13.9% when removing transitory storm-related costs. This quarter, we made progress towards getting back to our target cushion range of 100 to 150 basis points with the closing of our Louisiana and Mississippi LD, which resulted in net cash proceeds of a little over $1 billion. We also expect an additional $400 million of securitization proceeds related to the May 2024 Duraco storm event later this summer.\nIn addition, as Jason discussed, we plan to file for the cost determination for the roughly $1.1 billion of storm costs related to Hurricane Barrel and $100 million related to other storms within the next 2 weeks. We anticipate receiving securitization bond proceeds around the end of this year. During the quarter, we also took advantage of the recent stock performance and proactively worked to derisk 2026 financing plan. In particular, we executed equity forward sales through our ATM program of approximately $145 million.\nWith respect to 2025 common equity needs, there is no change as we do not anticipate the need for common equity through the remainder of the year to fund our current plan. However, we'll continue to be opportunistic in addressing 2026 equity needs. We will continue to stay laser-focused in supporting the balance sheet while also investing for the benefit of our customers and communities. We are off to a solid start in 2025, and we are right on plan to deliver our full year results. We are reaffirming our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guide range of $1.74 to $1.76, which equates to 8% growth at the midpoint from our delivered 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62. Over the long term, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of the 6% to 8% range annually through 2030. We look forward to the remainder of 2025 and executing for the benefit of all stakeholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Chris. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us through the end of the decade and beyond, and we look forward to sharing an updated 10-year plan in the third quarter of this year.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jason. With that, I'll now turn it over to Q&A. Operator? ."

[Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Jacqueline Richert, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert?\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to CenterPoint's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Jason Wells, our CEO; and Chris Foster, our CFO, will discuss the company's fourth quarter and full year 2024 results.\nManagement will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are currently based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based on various factors as noted in our Form 10-K, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements.\nWe reported $1.58 and $0.38 for the full year and fourth quarter of 2024, respectively, on a GAAP basis.\nManagement will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. When providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of diluted adjusted earnings per share on a consolidated basis referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to our earnings news release and presentation on our website. We use our website to announce material information.\nThis call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by extending my sincere appreciation to all of our frontline personnel that work through the unprecedented winter weather we experienced across our various service territories. We experienced subzero temperatures in Minnesota freezing rain in Indiana and record-breaking snowfall in the Houston area. Through it all, our team worked to keep the lights on and the gas flowing for our customers.\nOn today's call, I'd like to address 4 key areas of focus. First, I'll touch on the fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. Second, I'll provide a broader regulatory update, including highlights of our recently filed system resiliency plan for Houston Electric and touch on the significant progress we've made in our various rate cases. Third, I'll share an overview of the transaction we have proposed to ERCOT that we believe benefits all stakeholders. And lastly, I want to highlight the impressive growth drivers across the Houston area and how that growth informed the substantiated load filing we recently submitted to ERCOT.\nNow starting with our fourth quarter and full year financial results. This morning, we announced non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 for the fourth quarter and $1.62 for the full year. Chris will provide additional details of these strong results in his section. The $1.62 per share translates to 8% growth over our 2023 actual results. This is now the fourth consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our annual non-GAAP EPS guidance.\nIt is also important to note that we have rebased our long-term growth targets off these higher earnings levels each year as we seek to deliver value for our investors each and every year. Consistent with this approach, we are reaffirming our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.74 to $1.76, which equates to 8% growth at the midpoint from our delivered 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62. Over the long term, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% range annually through 2030. We also expect to grow dividends per share in line with earnings growth over the same period of time.\nNow turning to my second key area, and update on our broader regulatory efforts, starting with our recently refiled system resiliency plan at Houston Electric. In line with our commitments, we refiled our system resiliency plan at the end of January. This filing proposes a total spend of $5.75 billion from 2026 through 2028 to improve system resiliency. $5.5 billion of this spend is related to capital expenditures. Chris will discuss the associated capital expenditure increase from our previous plan in his section, but I want to briefly touch on the system improvements we are focused on in this filing.\nOur plan outlines 39 specific resiliency measures that are designed to strengthen tens of thousands of miles of our transmission and distribution system. The investments included in our filing represent the largest single investment in grid resiliency in our company's history, as we work to improve the customer experience for those that live and work in higher-risk areas. As a result of our planned work through 2028, we expect that our transmission system will be fully hardened with no remaining wood structures and that nearly all substations will be elevated above the 500-year floodplain.\nI am proud to say that with our accelerated pace in less than a year since Hurricane Beryl, we will have more than doubled the number of circuits that have automation on our system, and we won't stop there. With our system resiliency plan in another 3 years, we will triple the number of automated devices since Hurricane Beryl. We estimate that our actions over the next several years will save customers more than 1 billion outage minutes in extreme weather events.\nIn addition to contributing to an improved customer experience, beginning in 2029, these investments are anticipated to result in an estimated $50 million of reduced storm-related costs per year which naturally support lower electric delivery charges over the long term.\nAs I've mentioned before, this is not the beginning of our journey to a more resilient system but an acceleration of what we started a few years ago when we targeted hardening and modernizing the electric transmission backbone as well as some of our substations prone to flood risk. We believe that these investments, combined with the other actions outlined in our Greater Houston resiliency initiative, set us on a clear path to become the most resilient coastal grid in the country.\nNext, I want to focus on the continued regulatory progress at Houston Electric. As many of you recently saw, we reached a settlement in our 2024 rate case. We believe that the proposed settlement is constructive for both our customers and our investors. The proposed settlement, if approved, includes an annual revenue requirement decrease of $47 million, which translates to a reduction of approximately $1 per month in the average electric delivery charge for our residential customers. It also includes an increase to both our return on equity and equity ratio.\nThese improvements strengthen our competitiveness in the capital markets that we regularly access to efficiently fund capital investments for the benefit of our customers. This unique outcome of lower customer bills with improvements of both the cost of capital and capital structure comes despite the fact that we've increased our vegetation management spend by 45% over the last few years. It also exemplifies our ability to improve customer outcomes while also efficiently executing O&M reductions throughout the business. We'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for working together to submit to the PUCT what we believe is a constructive settlement for all parties.\nBeyond the rate case, we've also made progress on our traditional interim mechanisms and storm cost recovery filings at Houston Electric. Chris will provide further details regarding these items in his section.\nNow turning to Indiana Electric. A few weeks ago, we received a final order in our Indiana electric rate case. The final order was approved in line with the settlement filed in May of last year, which included a total annual revenue requirement increase of approximately $80 million and a 9.8% return on equity. We believe this is a fair and balanced outcome as we have continued to invest for the benefit of our customers, while also being conscious of the impact of our capital investments on the customer bill.\nOur move away from older generation facilities has enabled us to eliminate nearly $40 million of O&M directly benefiting our customer bills. We also previously securitized the remaining book value of one of our aging facilities forgoing profits related to this plant for the benefit of our customers. Moving forward, we will continue to be mindful of our customer bills and the reliability needs and work with stakeholders to achieve balanced outcomes for all parties.\nMoving to our Minnesota Gas rate case. During the fourth quarter, we reached an all-party settlement in our Minnesota Gas rate case. The settlement includes a total revenue requirement increase of nearly $104 million for 2024 and 2025, which reflects over 75% of our proposed revenue increase of approximately $136 million. Interim rates for the 2024 increase went into effect in January of last year, and interim rates for 2025 went into effect last month.\nThese rates closely mirror the increased revenue requirement included in the proposed settlement that is now pending a final order for the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The commission has a statutory deadline of July 1 to issue its final order in this case. We also want to thank all stakeholders for working together to achieve what we believe is a strong outcome for all parties.\nFinally, I want to briefly touch on our rate case for Ohio Gas. At the end of October, we filed our Ohio gas rate case application, which included a revenue requirement increase of $99.5 million. Over the last several years, we've had one of the lowest customer bills in the state. Our request reflects an investment recovery rate that will put us more in line with our Ohio peers. In addition, this larger revenue requirement increased will allow us to more efficiently fund and continue to prioritize pipeline modernization investments that we believe contribute to the overall safety and efficiency of the system.\nBefore closing out my remarks on our regulatory progress, I want to put into context what has been a very busy and constructive regulatory cycle. Over the last 18 months, our teams have been busy as they have filed 5 rate cases. Of the 5, we have received final orders in 2 and are awaiting approval of settlements for our Houston Electric and Minnesota Gas businesses.\nTogether, these 4 rate cases represent over 80% of our enterprise rate base. Should these cases be improved in line with their current proposed settlements, we will have been able to improve our consolidated return on equity and equity ratio, which naturally increases the earnings power of the company.\nI want to thank all of our teams for their hard work and dedication for working with stakeholders to achieve such strong outcomes for both our customers and our investors.\nNow I'd like to provide an update on our proposed temporary generation transaction. Through engagement with a diverse set of stakeholders, it is clear that there is no longer a desire for transmission and distribution utilities in the state to invest in large temporary generation facilities to mitigate the impact of large load shed events.\nIn response to this, we have worked with the same set of stakeholders to develop what we believe is a truly unique Texas solution that benefits Houston Electric customers, other ERCOT customers and CenterPoint investors. I will briefly walk through the contours of this transaction, and Chris will provide additional details related to the financial impacts.\nOur proposal to transfer the use of our units to a Texas payer utility will provide a temporary bridging solution for summer peak reliability needs in the San Antonio area. We will make these units available for this purpose for up to 2 years, starting this spring. After that, we intend to market the 15 large units to third parties at what we expect to be prevailing higher market rates. Given current market demand, we believe that the revenues earned for marketing these units after the period that they are in San Antonio will exceed the foregone revenues during the period these units are donated to ERCOT at no cost.\nWe truly believe this Texas solution is a win for all stakeholders. As part of this solution, we will make an unprecedented contribution of value for the benefit of the ERCOT grid. Houston Electric customers will be made whole on charges related to the large temporary units. And finally, our shareholders will receive the benefit of their investment when we take into consideration the anticipated profit from marketing after the period these units operate in the San Antonio area. We appreciate all stakeholders for providing their feedback and working collaboratively to identify this unique solution that ultimately benefits everyone.\nNow switching gears. I want to highlight the strong organic growth we continue to see, especially in our Texas service territories. While my earlier commentary focused on capital investments related to resiliency enhancements on our system, I want to emphasize that we continue to experience significant electric demand growth across Texas and particularly the Greater Houston area. We are proud to partner with both existing and potential new customers to support their energy needs as our region continues to experience rapid economic development. It is these discussions that have informed our estimated electric load forecast for the Houston region that we recently submitted to ERCOT.\nI want to briefly touch on what we included in our submission and equally important, what we excluded. Last year's ERCOT load report was largely focused on Texas electric needs outside of the Greater Houston region. We are excited to have now submitted our expected load increase for the greater Houston region this year. Like our peers, we've experienced an unprecedented level of interest in connecting to our grid. In fact, we have received approximately 40 gigawatts in load interconnection requests. Those load requests are incremental to our current peak of about 21 gigawatts.\nWhile we're actively pursuing this full set of load interconnection requests, we believe our submission is a more realistic reflection of the low growth that will materialize by 2031. Currently, we are forecasting a nearly 50% increase in peak demand from 21 gigawatts today to nearly 31 gigawatts by the end of 2031. To put that in perspective, the 10 gigawatt increase we are forecasting over the next 7 years is more than the increase that Greater Houston region has experienced over the last 25 years.\nOur rigorous approach to forecasting load demand gives us confidence in our projections. Our outlook also benefits from the fact this growth is not driven by a single industry or theme. Houston has clearly earned its reputation as the energy capital of the world, but our types of economic expansion go well beyond this core sector. It may come as a surprise to some that today, energy constitutes only a little more than 1/3 of the [ area's ] economy.\nWhen looking at Houston's low drivers, we see 3 economic activities as the catalyst for significant long-term load growth. First, Houston is a major logistics hub for the United States. Boasting the largest port by waterborne tonnage, Houston is a gateway for goods coming from and going all over the world. We forecasted opportunities for port electrification, fleet electrification and other associated projects will drive approximately 20% of the 10 gigawatt increase through 2031.\nSecond, Houston is home to the largest medical complex in the world, and it is only growing. It continues to expand not only its offerings for patients who come from all over the globe for treatment, but continues to pioneer medical innovation and medical manufacturing. We forecasted its continued expansion as well as other commercial activities, including data centers, will drive 30% of our anticipated load growth by 2031.\nThird, Houston is and will continue to be at the center for energy refining and energy exports. As the global energy mix continues to evolve, Houston will play a central role in the development and exportation of that energy. This significant growth will certainly require continued and increased investments in electric infrastructure, especially with respect to the transmission system.\nAs a reminder, Houston makes up just over 2% of the geographic area of Texas, but is approximately 1/4 of ERCOT's peak load. On any given day, we import as much as 60% of the electricity consumed in the Houston area.\nPrior to formalizing our capital investment plans related to this immense growth, we need the feedback and final decisions from the Texas Public Utility Commission regarding the 765 kV or 345 kV standard for transmission build-outs. We anticipate further clarity on this topic by May of this year.\nRegardless of the direction the PUCT takes, the continued growth of the Houston area is undoubtedly a long-term tailwind and is one that is truly unique to CenterPoint. The diverse underlying fundamentals driving Houston growth gives us continued confidence in our belief that we have one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry. This growth will continue to drive investment opportunities for years to come. but also provide a sustainable platform for our customers whose charges will continue to benefit from the ever-growing population.\nWe are privileged to serve such a growing and vibrant area and look forward to continuing to partner with customers, communities and other stakeholders to further enable this truly remarkable growth.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. Before I get into my updates, I want to echo Jason's gratitude for not only our CenterPoint coworkers, but also the external frontline crews who aided in the restoration in Indiana and kept energy flowing for our customers throughout our various service territories.\nThis morning, I will plan to cover 4 areas of focus: first, the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results; second, I'll touch on our capital deployment execution for the year as well as our upwardly revised capital plan that now reflects our recently filed system resiliency plan and an update on our other capital investment trackers; third, I'll go into further detail on our temporary generation proposal and the associated financial impacts; and finally, I'll provide an update on where we completed the year with respect to our balance sheet.\nLet's now move to the financial results shown on Slide 8. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.38 for the fourth quarter of 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.40 for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $0.32 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP EPS results for the fourth quarter remove the impacts associated with the sale of Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs. In the fourth quarter, these impacts included an $8 million deferred tax remeasurement reflecting a slightly lower effective state income tax rate post sale.\nNow taking a closer look at the quarter, growth in rate recovery contributed $0.05 when compared to the same quarter last year, which was driven by the ongoing recovery from interim mechanisms for which customer rates were updated in addition to approved interim rates related to our Minnesota Gas rate case. In addition, O&M contributed $0.05 of favorability when compared to the comparable quarter of 2023. This favorability was primarily driven by the approximately $0.03 of work that was pulled forward in Q4 of last year that we did not replicate this quarter. In addition to O&M and rate recovery, weather and usage contributed an additional $0.02 favorability quarter-over-quarter.\nInterest expense and financing costs were $0.03 unfavorable when compared to the comparable quarter in 2023. These $0.03 were primarily driven by the $3 billion of net new debt issuances quarter-over-quarter. And despite the headwinds we faced this year, we were still able to deliver for our investors our full year 2024 and non-GAAP EPS target of $1.62.\nI want to take a step back to discuss how we're thinking about O&M. Over the last few years, we've been able to reduce our O&M by nearly 2% annually. We are now committed to continuing to do more vegetation management work at Houston Electric, where we are now proposing to transition from our current 5-year vegetation management cycle to a 3-year cycle.\nThis positions us well given the long seasonal growth periods and has us leading statewide in Texas and among the few in our industry that seek this level of proactive vegetation management. This more aggressive cadence will naturally reset our O&M levels in the near term. However, we will be laser-focused on continuing to take costs out of the business elsewhere and continuing to target 1% to 2% O&M reductions from these higher levels, ultimately benefiting customer charges.\nFor example, as Jason pointed out earlier, starting in 2029, we anticipate saving roughly $50 million of storm costs annually from the investments outlined in our recently filed system resiliency plan. This overall level of execution gives us confidence in reiterating today our full year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance target range of $1.74 to $1.76. The midpoint of this range represents annual growth of 8% from our actual 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62 as we seek to deliver value for our shareholders each and every year.\nNext, I'll touch on our capital investment execution for 2024, as shown here on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we invested $1.2 billion of base work for the benefit of our customers and communities. For the full year, we invested $3.8 billion, exceeding our 2024 capital expenditure target of $3.7 billion, and this is despite multiple diversions from performing base work due to storm restoration.\nAs Jason touched on, our recently filed system resiliency plan includes capital investments of $5.5 billion. This updated plan results in a $500 million increase to the $47 billion capital investment plan that runs through 2030. As such, we are updating our capital investment target to $47.5 billion through the end of the decade, and we will fund our incremental capital investments consistent with our prior guidance. As such, you should assume we will fund in line with the enterprises approximate consolidated capital structure of 50% equity and 50% debt.\nSeparately, we are back now in our more traditional rhythm of seeking ongoing capital plan recoveries using existing mechanisms. At the same time, we continue to make progress on storm recoveries. Related to those recoveries, we are focused on progressing through the securitization process here in Texas and are currently ahead of plan. That is because we have now reached a settlement in principle on our [ major ratio event loss ].\nAs part of the proposed settlement, we will recover 98% of the cost attributable to the storm. This is a great outcome and one that further illustrates the constructive business and regulatory environment in which we operate here in Texas.\nWe're also still on track to make our cost recovery filing related to Hurricane Beryl in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to advance on our capital recovery mechanisms at Houston Electric. During the fourth quarter, we filed both our transmission and distribution trackers. In our transmission tracker or TCOS, we requested a revenue increase of approximately $63 million, which was approved and rates were updated to reflect this increase in mid-January.\nOur distribution tracker or DCRF, was filed at the beginning of December and reflected a requested revenue increase of approximately $100 million. We recently withdrew this filing because we're updating it with the revised figures to reflect the capital investments included in the rate case filing. We will also incorporate incremental capital investments through the end of December 2024 in our revised filing that we anticipate filing by the end of the first quarter.\nI'd now like to discuss the expected financial impacts for customers and investors associated with our temporary generation transaction that Jason referenced. First, I want to take a step back and walk through how we're thinking about our investment relating to the lease of our large temporary emergency generation units. There are essentially 3 periods, with the lease running through June of 2029. First, the period where the units were available to our CenterPoint customers to mitigate potential large load shed events. Second, the period the units will serve our fellow Texans. And third, the period where we will seek to market all 15 large temporary generation units to third parties at prevailing market rates.\nWhen crafting our proposal, our focus, first and foremost, was on our customers. We intend to be responsive to stakeholders that have expressed a desire for us to offset collections from regulatory recoveries of roughly $475 million. That's approximately the amount we'd seek to offset for our customers.\nLet me summarize how we would go about doing that. There are 3 components of customer benefit at a high level. First, in the spring of this year, we are proposing to make all of our 15 large temporary emergency generation units available to serve the San Antonio area to support reliability needs identified by ERCOT ahead of the summer load peak. We will make an unprecedented contribution for the benefit of Texans of approximately $180 million of value for an up to 2-year period. That's the time in which we would propose the large temporary generation unit will serve ERCOT customers, resulting in us not seeking future recovery of this balance for Houston Electric customers as they will cease to be a regulated investment.\nSecond, our Houston Electric customers will receive the benefit of the Houston Electric rate case settlement. When approved, saving customers around $250 million over a roughly 5-year period.\nAnd third, as we highlighted in the third quarter, we performed significant incremental work related to both the May storms and Hurricane Beryl recovery, and we will not seek recovery for roughly $110 million of these costs. We anticipate that during the time the units are serving as a statewide system benefit, cash flow will be slightly lower as collections from customers will be reduced to account for the foregone recovery related to the future use of these units.\nAt the end of that time, the third period will begin, where we seek to market all 15 large temporary generation units to third parties at prevailing market rates. The market has and continues to move favorably for mobile power units such as these, where we have seen market rates that are roughly double our original lease rate. As I briefly touched on, once these units move to the San Antonio area, we will not earn a regulated return with respect to our investment in them.\nGiven the unregulated nature of this investment going forward, we will remove the impacts, both favorable and unfavorable from our non-GAAP earnings numbers. Although we project the earnings and cash flow profile, have the potential to equal or better the prior regulated investment profile. This is now largely a timing item. And the asymmetric earnings profile of this investment is not consistent with our core regulated business. I will reiterate Jason's sentiments with respect to this Texas-centric solution. We believe this transaction is a tremendous outcome for all stakeholders.\nFinally, I want to touch on our balance sheet and how we're thinking about funding our increased capital plan. As of the end of the year, our adjusted FFO-to-debt ratio based on the Moody's rating methodology was 13.6% when removing storm-related costs. This is slightly below our target range of 14% to 15%. But as a reminder, it is transitory in nature as we anticipate receiving approximately $1 billion in cash proceeds next month from the closing of our Louisiana and Mississippi LDC sale.\nWe also expect an additional $500 million of securitization proceeds by the end of June, and we continue to expect to file for securitization of the $1.1 billion of storm costs related to Hurricane Beryl within the next few months, with proceeds anticipated coming by the end of the year.\nWe will continue to stay laser-focused in supporting balance sheet health, while also investing for the benefit of our customers and communities. With now 4 consecutive years, meeting or exceeding expectations, we continue to reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS target of 8% this year and the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% thereafter through 2030.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, I'm proud of our team for persevering through 2024, which marks our fourth year of meeting or exceeding our financial guidance. This performance places us in the top decile within our utility peer group.\nIn addition, we have a strong foundation in place for 2025 and beyond, a foundation that includes a comprehensive plan to deliver the most resilient coastal grid for our customers. Incremental CapEx announced today of $500 million driving 10% rate base growth through the end of the decade, which is one of the highest in the sector, constructively settling 4 rate cases representing over 80% of enterprise rate base, giving us clear line of sight for the next 4 years. And the privilege to serve one of the fastest-growing regions in our country with an expected peak load increase of approximately 50% in the Houston area through 2031, powered by a diverse set of economic drivers. This load growth undoubtedly provides incremental CapEx tailwinds to an already industry-leading plan.\nWe look forward to sharing more comprehensive details about the long-term investment opportunities later this year.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jason. Operator, we're now ready to take Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jackie Richert, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to CenterPoint Energy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Jason Wells, our CEO; and Chris Foster, our CFO, will discuss the company's second quarter results. Management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nActual results could differ materially based upon various factors as noted in our Form 10-Q, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call when providing guidance. We use the non-GAAP EPS measure of diluted adjusted earnings per share on a consolidated basis referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed on this call, please refer to today's news release and presentation on our website. We use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Before spending most of my time discussing the impact of and our response to Hurricane Beryl, I will very briefly touch on our results for the second quarter. I'll then turn it over to Chris for a regulatory update and a more detailed recap of our financial results. For the second quarter, we reported GAAP and non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share. In addition, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63. Beyond 2024, we are also reaffirming our long-term guidance where we expect to grow non-GAAP EPS and dividend per share growth at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% range annually through 2030.\nNow to turn to our primary area of focus. Earlier this month, Hurricane Beryl impacted our entire 5,000 square mile service territory in the Greater Houston area causing power outages for nearly 2.3 million of our customers or approximately 80% of our Houston Electric customer base. We began tracking Hurricane Beryl and preparing for a possible impact 9 days before Beryl made landfall. Initial forecast showed that our service area in Greater Houston would be spared a direct impact by the worst of the hurricane. Nonetheless, we remain vigilant and planned for impact. .\nWe initially secured 3,000 mutual assistance crew members from locations safely outside of the projected path of the store. We also coordinated utilities across Texas and the region to ensure resource availability. As the forecast trajectory changed, we quickly called on additional mutual assistance resources, ultimately activating and deploying over 15,000 CenterPoint mutual assistance crew members. Early in the morning on Monday, July 8, Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a powerful category one hurricane with heavy rains, flooding and up to 97-mile hour wins that reached further inland than any storm experienced in Houston since 1983.\nAs part of our response, we restored power to over 1 million customers within 48 hours replaced over 3,000 distribution [ bulls ] on our system, walked over 8,500 circuit miles to repair damage and deployed mobile generators at 28 sites across the Greater Houston area to various critical facilities. Impacts to our distribution lines and facilities from vegetation, such as uprooted trees and related debris carried by the very high winds were the primary cause of customer outages. In recent years, trees in the Houston area have been weakened due to a combination of high rainfall, prior drought conditions as well as winter freezes. We trimmed or removed approximately 35,000 trees during our restoration process.\nThrough discussion with one of our largest vegetation management companies, 60% of the vegetation it removed for trees that had fallen from outside of our rights of way. Over the last 18 months, we proactively worked to address the challenges these conditions present to our distribution system through increased vegetation management. In fact, in 2023, our Houston Health business increased its vegetation management spend by over 30% from the prior year. We continue to execute and invest at a similar higher level of vegetation management as we recognize the impacts of the challenging growing seasons experienced in the Houston area over the last 3 years and the resulting threat they could have on our lines and infrastructure.\nIn addition, Hurricane Beryl's destructive wins in combination with already weakened crease highlighted not only the urgency with which we need to execute on our vegetation management plan, but also the scope. As a result, we have doubled our vegetation management resources and are aggressively tackling the riskier line miles with trees nearby. We will trim or remove trees related to an incremental 2,000 miles of our system by December 31 of this year. This represents a nearly 50% increase compared to our planned work for 2024.\nThe vegetation work we have begun is only a part of a more comprehensive plan to improve customer outcomes and directly address the customer concerns and frustrations voiced with respect to critical aspects of our emergency response. This plan will also help us better prepare our response in key areas to future storms or hurricanes. I will walk through the 3 pillars of our comprehensive action plan to address our customers' concerns.\nOur first pillar relates to our resiliency investments by accelerating the adoption of advanced construction standards retrofitting existing assets on an accelerated basis, and using predictive modeling and AI as well as other advanced technologies, we will harden our distribution system to help withstand more extreme weather and improve the speed of restoration. This is in addition to proactive steps we took nearly 2 years ago when we moved to constructing at the new national standard for high wind and extreme ice loading.\nSecond, we will build a best-in-class customer communications program. Since the ratio that impacted Houston and May, our outage tracker has not been available for our customers. The tracker we previously used was hosted on a physical server that was not able to accommodate the demand of millions of users at one time. To keep our communities informed, we provided daily restoration updates, but we understand that for many, this was insufficient. As one component of our customer communication action plan, we are launching a new more customer-oriented outage tracker later this week.\nOur new outage tracker will help provide our customers more of the information they need in a timely fashion. It will also be comparable to what our Texas peer utility customers experience. The new tracker is cloud-based, which will also allow us to scale to high levels of demand. Third, we will strengthen our partnerships with government and community leaders. Effective emergency preparedness and response requires close coordination with government officials. We will hire a seasoned emergency response leader to help the company rapidly accelerate its planning capabilities and to develop close community partnerships to help ease the burden of storm events on our more vulnerable communities.\nWe believe the work underlying these 3 pillars will support our efforts to build and operate a grid that meets the demands of one of the most dynamic economies in the United States here in Houston. The initial set of specific actions we are taking is laid out on Slide 3. We will also be taking additional actions as we continue to learn from our internal reviews and external independent review as well as through engagement with emergency response experts, our customers, elected officials and community stakeholders. Our singular and overarching goal is to improve in every area of our emergency preparedness and response.\nWhether it is before, during or after any future storm, we will be better prepared to support, communicate with and serve our customers in these times of emergency. As we begin to execute this initial plan, we will work to consistently provide updates on our progress. The men and women at CenterPoint go to work every day with an unrelenting focus on delivering safe, reliable and resilient energy to our customers while also striving to improve their experience. We will continue to make customer-focused capital investments to achieve better outcomes for the nearly 3 million electric customers and over 4 million gas customers across our 6-state footprint.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. Before I get into my updates, I want to echo Jason's gratitude to our customers and our communities. Our team is focused on improving our resilience and emergency response capabilities. and I will speak to our financial plan to support those efforts in my remarks today. Today, I'd like to cover 3 areas of focus. First, the details of our second quarter financial results and guidance. Second, I'll provide a brief update of the progress we're making on our regulatory calendar. Third, I'll touch on our capital deployment status this quarter and forecasted storm costs. And finally, I'll provide an update on our financing plans. .\nAgain, as Jason noted, today, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63, which represents 8% growth at the midpoint from our 2023 actual results of $1.50. Beyond 2024, we are also reaffirming our guidance where we expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of the 6% to 8% range annually through 2030 as well as targeting dividend per share growth in line with earnings per share growth.\nLet's now move to the financial results shown on Slide 4. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.36 for the second quarter of 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, we also reported $0.36 for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.28 in the second quarter of 2023. Diving into more detail of the earnings drivers for the quarter, growth in rate recovery contributed $0.10, which is primarily driven by the ongoing recovery from various interim mechanisms for which customer rates were updated last year as well as the interim rates in our Minnesota gas business that went into effect on January 1 of this year.\nIn addition, the Houston area continues to see strong organic growth, extending the long-term trend of 1% to 2% average annual customer growth. This sustained growth has been beneficial for our customers and investors alike. O&M was $0.02 favorable for the quarter. This favorable variance was driven primarily by the fact that we incurred more of our expenses in the first quarter and had some of our scheduled activities diverted to attend to restoration efforts related to the major [ agro ] storm. Partially offsetting the favorable items from rate recovery in O&M were unfavorable weather and increased interest expense.\nWeather and usage were $0.01 unfavorable when compared to the comparable quarter of 2023, driven primarily by a milder spring in our Minnesota gas service territory. Interest expense was $0.06 unfavorable primarily driven by the new debt issuances since the first quarter of last year to fund customer-driven work across our electric and gas territories at a higher relative cost of debt. I now want to turn to an update on our broader regulatory calendar and progress, and I'll cover these sequentially from the dates filed.\nStarting with Texas Gas, where last month, we received Railroad Commission approval of our now final settlement. As a reminder, our Ford Texas gas jurisdictions will now be consolidated on a go-forward basis for our ongoing rate adjustments. This new consolidation should benefit many customers through a lower impact on their bills from certain investments and also a reduced administrative burden for other stakeholders.\nMoving next to the filed Minnesota gas rate case. And as a reminder, we filed our rate case on November 1 of last year. As discussed on the last call, the interim rates for 2024 were approved in mid-December and went into effect on January 1. The Minnesota Commission will consider interim rates for 2025 toward the end of this year, depending on how far along we are in the case. Hearings are scheduled to occur in the middle of December of this year. Ahead of those hearings, we intend to engage in settlement discussions with parties involved in the case. And as you may recall, we have settled our previous 3 rate cases in our Minnesota gas jurisdiction.\nNow turning to the Indiana Electric rate case. We currently have a nonunanimous settlement pending approval. Hearings on this settlement will begin the first week of September with the new statutory deadline for a final order of February 3. We look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders to achieve what we believe to be a reasonable outcome for all parties.\nI'll now touch on our largest jurisdiction, Houston Electric. Over the last month, we have been engaged with many stakeholders as part of settlement discussions in our pending rate case. Those discussions are ongoing, and we continue to provide regular updates to the ALJ in the case. In addition, as we execute on the actions we've laid out following Hurricane Beryl, we intend to work with stakeholders on how to amend our system resiliency plan with the PUCT. The process is fluid, but at this stage, we have abated the schedule on the underlying system resiliency plan, which all parties have agreed to. This allows us to take the coming months to reflect stakeholder input and additional potential system resiliency concepts that emerged from our after-action review and the review of the PUCT.\nWe currently anticipate filing a revised plan later in Q1 2025. Lastly, I want to briefly mention that next month, we will file a notice of intent for our upcoming rate case for our Ohio gas business, which is approximately $1.4 billion in rate base. Next, I'll touch on our capital investments thus far in 2024, as shown on Slide 6 including the anticipated impact of storm costs and their associated recovery.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we invested $800 million of base work for the benefit of our customers and communities. This excludes spending related to storm restoration. We now have a little less than 60% of our original 2024 capital expenditure target of $3.7 billion to be invested over the remainder of the year, excluding storm costs. We remain on track to meet our capital investment target despite the interruptions of normal capital deployment from the storms we've experienced this year. Maintaining our target as we consider a revised version of the resiliency work is a reflection of the conservatism with which we plan each and every year.\nAlthough the cost invoicing in that final, total spending associated with the May storm events and Hurricane Beryl are currently estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We currently anticipate that we will securitize both the capital and noncapital portion of the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion distribution costs to limit the impact to our customers on their bills and will include approximately $100 million of transmission investments within the next TCOS recovery filing. Based on the total current average residential electric bill, we estimate that these costs could result in an increase of a little more than 2%.\nAs a reminder, the mechanism to recover storm costs in the state of Texas is very constructive and cost effective for customers. Texas TDUs are able to securitize [indiscernible] cost of storm-related costs in excess of approximately $100 million under existing statutory authority. As a result, we anticipate filing for securitization in the fourth quarter of this year with securitization bond proceeds expected to be received towards the end of next year.\nFinally, I want to touch on our balance sheet and how we're thinking about funding the storm costs I just discussed. As of the end of the second quarter, our calculated FFO to debt was 13.3% based on our calculation aligning with Moody's methodology as shown on Slide 7. The second quarter tends to be our lightest quarter due to the timing of incremental financing relative to interim recovery mechanisms. This quarter also had a temporary cash flow item that we expect to normalize through the next quarter.\nTaking a step back, as we continue to see the need to fund growth we are experiencing in Texas, we remain focused on the balance sheet. And with respect to our financing plans through the end of the year, we have evolved our approach, recognizing the [ impact ]. As we remain committed to maintaining our current credit metrics in light of these incremental costs, we intend to pull forward $250 million of equity planned for 2025 into this year, which is in addition to the $250 million issued to date. This does not change our long-term equity guidance, rather should only be considered as an acceleration.\nWe will also incorporate higher equity content into our upcoming debt issuances to enhance credit metrics until the anticipated securitization proceeds are received. We would also see this as pulling forward instruments we've been considering in our long-term plans as mentioned in recent quarterly calls. We remain confident in the continuation of our long-term execution.\nThe last thing I want to mention is we are making good progress related to the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs. We, along with the buyer, have now made all required regulatory filings, including filings with the Louisiana and Mississippi Public Service Commission, and we look forward to working constructively with the commissions to facilitate the approval proceedings. We still anticipate closing the sale late in the first quarter of 2025 and is anticipated to result in after cash tax proceeds of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, a majority of these proceeds will be used to fund our capital investments at Houston Electric for the benefit of customers.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Chris. Regardless of the challenges we face, this management team remains firmly committed to delivering for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our communities, our regulators, our legislators and our investors.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jason. With that, operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

We will use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. As many of you likely saw from this morning's earnings release, we are off to a strong start in 2024 despite the mild weather and the general trend of higher [ for ] longer interest rate environment our sector has experienced. This quarter is yet another illustration of why we believe we have one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry, which we plan to consistently execute and thoughtfully enhance for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\nOn this morning's call, I'd like to address 3 key areas of focus before handing the call over to Chris to discuss our financial results in more detail. First, I'll briefly summarize the strong first quarter financial results I just alluded to. Second, I'll touch on the details of our most recent filing at Houston Electric related to our resiliency investments, including the potential for incremental CapEx. And lastly, I'll provide an update on where we stand with respect to our regulatory calendar including an overview of our pending rate cases and an important update on the settlement of our Texas Gas rate case, where we are hopeful for an eventual constructive outcome for our stakeholders.\nFirst, turning to our financial results for the first [ quarter ]. This morning, we announced non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 for the first quarter, which represents over 1/3 of our full year non-GAAP earnings guidance at the midpoint. As a reminder, our full year 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63 represents 8% growth at the midpoint from our 2023 actual results of $1.50 per share and reflects our continued folks delivering value for our investors each and every year. Beyond 2024, we are reaffirming our guidance where we expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% range annually through 2030 as well as targeting dividend per share growth, in line with earnings per share growth over that same period of time. Chris will provide additional details regarding our financial results and earnings guidance shortly.\nNow I'll turn to the recent announcement we made regarding Houston Electric's resiliency plan filing. There's been a tremendous amount of collaboration by the public and private sector to align our focus on great resiliency across the state of Texas. I want to applaud the state for its continued support for providing additional tools to help improve resiliency of the electric grid, all of which serves to support the continued economic growth here in Texas. This legislation is a recognition of investments needed to strengthen the resiliency of the grid for the increasing risk of disruptive, extreme weather-related or security-related events while at the same time accommodating [ load ] growth across Texas. Through these filings, we anticipate achieving a faster pace of investments to support higher levels of resiliency for our customers while also utilizing a recovery mechanism that is expected to enable smoother and more efficient recovery of certain distribution-related costs for the benefit of our customers and our investors.\nOur focus on delivering a more [ reasonable ] [indiscernible] that serves approximately 2.8 million metered customers across the Greater Houston area has been underway for some time. The sequence of our work portfolio began with enhancing our electric transmission system and related substation, which comprised the backbone of our electric grid. This work included upgrading our transmission structures to better withstand extreme winds, elevating our substations to mitigate flood risk and converting our older 69 kV transmission lines to a more robust 138 kV standard. We will continue this work on the backbone of our system and when the first 3-year cycle proposed in this filing is complete in 2027, we believe we will have finished the vast majority of work associated with these programs.\nWith that series of measures well underway, we're now complementing these program elements by expanding our targeted investments to improve outcomes closer to the customer. Our work articulated in our resiliency filing has 24 individual resiliency measures that are focused on advancing the overall resiliency of our system. The 3-year plan is expected to significantly improve customer outcomes from the most severe system events associated with extreme wind, flood, temperature changes and wildfires. Additionally, measures are being undertaken to bolster physical and cybersecurity. Examples of some of the solutions will deploy include composite poles, trip [ saver ] devices and intelligent grid switching automation technology. All of these are proven to help the system respond more favorably in extreme conditions, resulting in a reduced number of sustained interruptions that our customers experience.\nIn fact, we've steadily deployed similar system automation in recent years, saving our customers over 300 million minutes of interruptions over the last 5 years. With the investments included in our resiliency plan filing, we could more than triple that figure over the next few years. In aggregate, our filing includes a range of investments of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion over the 3-year period of 2025 to 2027. The high end of our filing, if approved, would increase our total capital expenditures from $44.5 billion to $45 billion over our 10-year plan ended in 2030.\nConsistent with how we have historically incorporated incremental investment opportunities in our base plan, the $500 million of additional capital will be formally included in our capital investment plan when we believe we can efficiently execute, finance and recover these investments.\nWe will also align our execution with the feedback and final resolution of the resiliency plan proceeding, which we anticipate will be towards the end of this year. While we have factored the majority of this resiliency investment within our updated CapEx and financing plans discussed last quarter, Chris will describe thoughts on efficiently funding the incremental $500 million of capital investment opportunity including pursuing various state and federal incentives. We are excited to work with the commission and other stakeholders to get feedback on the plan we proposed and most importantly, executing work to create a more resilient electric grid for our customers.\nI now want to turn to an update on broader regulatory calendar. I'll cover these sequentially from the dates file, starting with a Texas Gas rate case, where we have recently announced a party settlement. Although this settlement is still subject to railroad commission approval, we believe the settlement agreement reached with parties is a constructive outcome for our customers and all other stakeholders. In its current form, pending approval, the case will result in an annual revenue requirement increase of approximately $5 million, which results in an average increase of well under 1/10 of 1% for our Houston area residential customers. This very modest customer bill increase is a great illustration of the power of organic growth, coupled with our continued focus on reducing O&M across our businesses. The Texas Gas rate case filing included nearly $500 million of new capital investments and an increase to its authorized cost of capital that I'll briefly touch on in a moment, all while resulting in a very modest increase for our customers.\nSince the last rate case, we have invested a total of $1.4 billion in CapEx to continue to improve system safety and reliability for our customers. These investments have translated to more than 1,800 miles of pipe replacement and more than 300,000 advanced meter upgrades, all helping to modernize our gas network. As I just mentioned, our $5 million settled revenue requirement proposal includes an increase to our authorized capital structure and return on equity. The proposed settlement includes an authorized equity ratio of approximately 61% and an authorized return on equity of 9.8% across our entire Texas gas jurisdiction. In comparison, we are currently authorized on average for a 55.5% equity layer and a 9.64% return on equity across the 4 historic divisions, increasing both our authorized equity ratio and our authorized return on equity is vital to the Texas Gas business as well as our other regulated businesses as we continue to compete for capital to make critical investments for our customers.\nIn addition to the minimal impact to our customer bills, the settlement combines our 4 historic Texas gas jurisdictions into 1 jurisdiction for future capital recovery mechanisms which will benefit all stakeholders through reduced administrative burden and the ability to spread future investments over a broader growing customer base. We appreciate the effort of various parties involved in the rate case to this point and expect railroad [indiscernible] consideration of the settlement this summer.\nMoving to the filed Minnesota Gas rate case. As a reminder, we filed our rate case on November 1 of last year, with a requested revenue increase of approximately $85 million and $52 million for 2024 and 2025, respectively. As discussed on the last call, the interim rates for 2024 were approved in mid-December and went into effect on January 1 of this year. The commission will consider interim rates for 2025 toward the end of this year, depending on how far along we are in the case. At this stage, we anticipate hearings to occur in the middle of December this year. Head of those hearings, we intend to engage parties to the case in settlement discussions. As you may recall, we have settled our previous 3 rate cases at our Minnesota Gas jurisdiction.\nNow turning to the Indian Electric rate case, which we filed in December of last year with a requested revenue requirement of $190 million. As we've discussed previously, much of this revenue requirement increase is associated with our investments in connection with our electric generation transition plan as we move away from coal to more efficient and cost-effective fuel types such as renewables and natural gas. We have slightly delayed the start of the hearings in this case to determine if a settlement is possible with parties. Absent a settlement, we would expect a final decision in this case in the fourth quarter of this year.\nAnd finally, I'll touch on our largest jurisdiction, Houston Electric. As many of you saw, we have filed our rate case last month with a requested revenue requirement increase of 2.6%, which is approximately $60 million. This revenue requirement increase results in a relatively nominal residential customer charge increase of about $1.25 per month or less than 1%. This revenue requirement increase is premised on the filing seeking an authorized equity ratio of approximately 45% and an authorized return on equity of 10.4%. As a reminder, we've been funding the Houston Electric business with a 45% equity ratio, as we believe this is the minimum amount of equity with which this business should be capitalized even though we are currently authorized at 42.5%. The modest revenue requirement request truly exemplifies the strong advantage we have here at CenterPoint, as it's driven by: one, our relentless focus on reducing O&M 1% to 2% per year on average, two, prior securitization charges rolling off the bill in October of this year; and three, the nearly unparalleled growth at Houston Electric and surrounding areas experienced each and every year.\nTo put these combined factors into perspective, since our last rate case in 2019, Houston Electric's rate base has nearly doubled, while the residential charges were nearly the same amount at the beginning of 2024 as they were all the way back in 2014.\nAs a management team, we are acutely aware of the advantage we have to serve a growing economy like Houston, but we also understand the tremendous responsibility that a company [indiscernible] We are tasked with serving and supporting the dynamic growth of Houston's vibrant and diverse population. One recent tangible example of Houston's continued expansion can be seen from the nearly $6 billion in Department of Energy grants awarded a little over a month ago. Nearly 1/3 of these grants were ordered for projects in the Greater Houston area. If completed, we believe these projects associated with these grants could contribute well over 500 megawatts alone in new load in the Houston Electric service territory. And this is just one of many examples of the explosive load growth potential in this region. We look forward to working with our stakeholders as we continue to support this incredible growth story here in Houston.\nBefore moving on, I want to briefly mention that we have one other rate case that we will be filing in 2024 related to our Ohio Gas business. We anticipate filing this rate case in August of this year, and we'll provide more details as we get closer to the filing.\nWe look forward to continuing to work with all of our stakeholders to reach constructive resolutions to all of our rate cases. We believe we are well positioned in all of our filings as we've made prudent investments on behalf of our customers and have made concerted efforts to reduce controllable O&M for the benefit of the communities we serve. Those are all of my updates for now.\nWith a strong start here in 2024, we have laid the foundation to once again meet or exceed expectations for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. I'm proud of the early milestones already achieved in 2024 and look forward to being able to provide progress on our cases and how the resiliency plan filing and other opportunities may influence incremental investments in the future. I am confident in our path forward and our ability to continue as we reaffirm our commitment to our proven strategy into our non-GAAP EPS guidance target range of 8% in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% non-GAAP EPS guidance target range annually from 2025 through 2030. And as we've mentioned in recent quarters, we'll be prepared to update a new 10-year plan through an Analyst Day following the conclusion of our rate cases next year.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Chris for his financial updates.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. Today, I'd like to cover 3 areas of focus. First, the details of our strong first quarter financial results. Second, I'll touch on our capital deployment progress this quarter and the potential for incremental capital related to Houston Electric system resiliency plan filing. And finally, I'll provide an update on where we stand with respect to our current financing plan and credit metrics.\nLet's start with the financial results shown on Slide 6. As Jason highlighted earlier, the first quarter of 2024 was yet another strong quarter of financial performance here at CenterPoint. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.55 for the first quarter of 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, we also reported $0.55 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.50 in the first quarter of 2023. With these first quarter results, we have now earned over 1/3 of our full year 2024 non-GAAP earnings guidance at the midpoint.\nDiving into more detail of the earnings drivers for the quarter, growth in rate recovery contributed $0.09, which was primarily driven by the ongoing recovery from various interim mechanisms for which the customer rates were updated last year. In addition to those capital recovery mechanisms, interim rates in our Minnesota gas business went into effect on January 1 of this year. These rates reflect a revenue requirement increase of approximately $69 million, which when combined with our requested 2025 revenue increase, represent an approximately 5% average bill increase over the next 2 years.\nIn addition, we continue to see strong organic growth in the Houston area, extending the long-term trend of 1% to 2% average annual customer growth, which continues to benefit both customers and investors. A great illustration of this continued growth can be found in the impressive job creation we've observed in Houston over the last year. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the Houston Metro area, added the second most jobs in the entire U.S. from February of last year to February 2024. Weather and usage were $0.02 favorable when compared to the same quarter of 2023. And despite the mild weather, the $0.02 favorable variance was largely driven by more favorable weather when compared to an extremely mild Q1 of 2023, partially offsetting the favorable items from rate recovery and usage were increases in O&M and interest expense.\nO&M was $0.02 unfavorable for the first quarter. This unfavorable variance was driven by additional work pulled forward in the first quarter of this year as well as storm response recovery efforts. However, we remain on track to achieve our target of reducing O&M 1% to 2% per year on average through 2030. Interest expense was $0.04 unfavorable, primarily driven by the new debt issuances since the first quarter of last year at a higher relative cost of debt. However, the impact of this increase was partially offset by the redemption of all outstanding shares of the Series A preferred for $800 million last September which eliminated the approximately $12 million quarterly dividend. I'll discuss our long-term financing plan and balance sheet in greater detail later.\nNext, I'll touch on our capital execution thus far in 2024 and the state of our 10-year capital plan target, which you can see here on Slide 7. In short, we are right on plan. The first quarter of 2024 represented yet another quarter of solid capital investment execution as we invested $800 million for the benefit of our customers and communities. This represents a little over 20% of our 2024 capital expenditure target of $3.7 billion.\nOur approach to incorporating customer-driven capital has resulted in a capital investment plan of $44.5 billion and potentially more, which represents an increase of over 10% since our 2021 Analyst Day. This increased capital plan is expected to drive a nearly 10% rate base CAGR through 2030, which supports strong earnings growth through the remainder of the decade. We continue to estimate our growth in customer delivery charges at Houston Electric to be equal to or less than historical inflation rate of 2% through 2030 with this capital investment profile. We have confidence in our ability to achieve this, given the size of Houston Electric's customer base and the underlying tremendous organic growth, securitization charges that are rolling off the bill later this year, and our plan to reduce O&M as I referenced.\nIn addition to enhancing the customer experience through our capital investments, we remain focused on affordability, both from an O&M and ongoing targeted capital perspective. A great illustration as to why we are confident that we can continue to prudently invest while keeping customer charges modest can be found by looking at our utility delivery charge increases over the last 10 years. Since 2014, Houston Electric's average monthly delivery charges have stayed essentially flat. That's a truly remarkable outcome for our customers. And as Jason mentioned, our capital has potential for further incremental revisions driven by our resiliency filing in Texas. The system resiliency plan filing could drive incremental customer-driven opportunities of up to $500 million at the high end range of our proposed investment. And I want to reiterate that over the past couple of years, we have been increasing our capital investment plan through 2030 and as we identify incremental investment opportunities that we believe we can efficiently execute, finance and recover.\nLet's spend a moment on the potential for funding the incremental resiliency investment opportunities of approximately $500 million, which Jason mentioned, we are applying for various federal dollars through multiple avenues and have already applied for $100 million of [ grid ] applications through the Department of Energy Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership funding opportunity, and that was submitted a little over a week ago. These funds, if approved, would primarily assist in providing a lower cost of borrowing for our resiliency initiatives around distribution circuit rebuilds and substation resiliency innovations.\nIn addition, we will also seek other efficient funding opportunities through federal and state matching programs such as the DOE loan guarantee program. CenterPoint has 3 separate loan applications working through the process in various stages for over $2 billion in aggregate. While these are loan dollars, not grant dollars, the relative cost savings versus traditional debt can be substantial, around 100 basis points, representing meaningful savings for customers. As Jason alluded to, we are actively pursuing these avenues of funding as we believe these are incredibly valuable initiatives for customers. To the extent that we are not successful, our consistent growth capital investment rule of thumb holds which is funding in line with our consolidated capital structure.\nFinally, to highlight the balance sheet and credit strength. As of the end of the first quarter, our calculated FFO to debt is 14.6%, based on our calculation aligning with Moody's methodology, as shown on Slide 20. On a full year 2024 basis, we still anticipate delivering on the 100 to 150 basis points cushion we continue to emphasize when applying Moody's methodology.\nAs you can see on the slide, we've also included S&P's calculation on the slides this quarter and will continue to do so going forward. As the computations illustrate, we've adjusted our calculations for onetime items, mainly driven by Winter Storm Yuri. We have had 2 years of onetime items related to the over $1 billion of extraordinary gas costs associated with that storm. We don't believe that this debt nor is the eventual receipt of the proceeds and associated taxes were indicative of the fundamental credit health of the company and adjusted accordingly.\nFor comparative purposes, you can see on the slide that we put our calculated 14% in the middle of the 18.5% FFO to debt that Moody's derived and the 11.2% calculation that S&P derived. To be clear, we see no need to change our current financing plans we shared with our rating agencies earlier this year to improve the outlook from S&P on our credit metrics.\nIn addition, we've made good progress against the modest $250 million at the market or ATM equity program year-to-date. We have completed approximately 75% of our equity sales through today leaving only around an expected $60 million of equity remaining to be issued this year. As a reminder, we continue to have slightly elevated parent debt to total debt as we are continuing to carry over $400 million of debt at the parent to support what we believe is the proper capitalization of the CEHE and [indiscernible] operating companies through rate cases. We plan to continue to carry that through the [ CE ] rate case supporting its approximately 45% equity layer today.\nOn the solid footing of a strong first quarter, we continue to reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS target of 8% this year and the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually thereafter through 2030. This growth is supported by differentiating factors that we enjoy, including consistent customer organic growth, which has averaged 2% per year over the last 30 years in the Houston area, Texas' pro-business environment which continues to attract new investment, especially in the Gulf Coast region. And lastly, our relentless focus on O&M discipline. We believe these factors will allow us to sustainably grow for years to come.\nThe last thing I want to mention is that we are making good progress related to the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs. We, along with the buyer, have now made all required regulatory filings including filings with the Louisiana and Mississippi Public Service Commission, and we look forward to working [ constructively ] with the commission to facilitate the approval proceedings. We still anticipate closing the sale later first quarter 2025 and is anticipated to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1 billion, which equates to an earnings multiple of nearly 32x 2023 earnings. This will be a terrific outcome for all stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Chris. I look forward to continuing not only to execute on what I believe to be 1 of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry, but also enhancing it for the benefit of all of our stakeholders in both the near and long term.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jason. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Jackie Richert, Vice President of Corporate Planning, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert, please go ahead.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to CenterPoint's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Jason Wells, our CEO; and Chris Foster, our CFO, will discuss the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon various factors as noted in our Form 10-K, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. When providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of diluted adjusted earnings per share on a consolidated basis, referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to our news releases and presentations on the website. We use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the quarter and the annual results for the first time as CEO, I want to take a moment to thank the Board once again for entrusting me to lead this great company into its next chapter. I'm privileged to work with an amazing team, and I couldn't be prouder of how we closed out 2023 and how we're off to an already strong start in 2024. On this morning's call, I'm excited to cover 4 key topics before turning it over to Chris to our financial results in more detail.\nFirst, I want to discuss my continued commitment to our strategic objectives that I have now stepped into this new role. Second, I'll briefly summarize the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Third, I'll discuss the rationale for the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs that we announced this morning and provide an update on our long-term capital investment plan. Finally, I'll conclude with an update on where we stand with respect to our regulatory calendar. I'm fortunate to step into this role at a time when CenterPoint is undoubtedly better positioned than it was when we held our Analyst Day in 2021. In my time here, I've clearly articulated that I believe we have one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the history. My focus will be continuing our established track record of consistently executing this plan and thoughtfully enhancing it for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\nAt our 2021 Analyst Day, we put forth a premium value proposition underpinned by our strategic objectives, which included delivering consistent and sustainable non-GAAP EPS and dividend per share growth to our investors, investing in customer-driven capital in our core regulated utility businesses driving industry-leading rate base growth. Providing affordable service to our customers through O&M discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet while efficiently funding our capital investments. I want to reiterate my commitment to these strategic objectives and discuss each in more detail.\nFirst, looking at delivering consistent and sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Looking over the last 3 years, we have demonstrated that not only do we have a great plan in which we have targeted 8% non-GAAP EPS growth each year, but we also have the ability to execute above expectations. This execution resulted in us achieving a 9% non-GAAP EPS CAGR over that period, which is top decile in the sector. In addition to growing non-GAAP EPS, we also grew our dividend in line with earnings, leading one of the highest dividend growth rates in the sector over that same period of time. To expand on a point I made last quarter, I'm excited about the company's great future as we continue to be laser-focused on providing outstanding service to our customers and communities and executing consistently to deliver enhanced stakeholder value. We are collectively focused on continuously improving service levels while maintaining customer affordability by utilizing a lean mindset throughout the organization.\nNow turning to investing in customer-driven capital in our regulated businesses. Supporting our strong financial results as a capital investment plan and resulting rate base growth that is among the highest in the sector. At our 2021 Analyst Day, we outlined a $40 billion plus capital investment plan that translated to an approximately 9% rate base growth through 2030. Today, we're once again announcing a capital increase supported by customer-driven capital investments to $44.5 billion, a nearly 11% increase since the 2021 Analyst Day. This revised capital investment plan now support 10% rate base growth CAGR through 2030, which is, again, one of the highest in the industry. This strong growth will continue to serve as a solid foundation for our long-term non-GAAP EPS growth targets.\nIn addition to effectively executing on our capital plan, we also strive to provide affordable service to our customers. We continue to be mindful of the impact of our investments on our customer bills. For this reason, we remain focused on our target of reducing O&M 1% to 2% per year on average through 2030. Our relentless attention to this area has resulted in an average annual reduction of 2% over the last 3 years, the high end of our target range, despite reinvesting additional savings back into the business for the benefit of our customers. One of the other targets we put forth in our 2021 Analyst Day dovetails with our O&M reduction targets. As we target our net 0 goal for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2035, we are retiring generation from less efficient fuel sources, which translates into customer savings over the long term.\nFinally, turning our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and efficiently financing our customer-driven investments. At our 2021 Analyst Day, we targeted funding our 10-year capital investment plan through 2030 without reliance on external equity issuances. We evolved that message last quarter with the introduction of a modest ATM program to support growth capital investment opportunities in 2024. And today, we're continuing that efficient financing evolution with our strategic transaction we announced this morning. The transaction, which I'll discuss in more detail will be the fourth we have pursued to recycle capital and reinvest transaction proceeds back into our regulated operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.\nIn addition, as we have incremental financing needs outside of our growth capital investment plans, we are also extending the need for $250 million per year of equity or equity-like funding through 2030. Chris will provide further color regarding our ongoing financing of our business. Moving to my second key topic, I'll cover the fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. This morning, we announced non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 for the quarter and full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS of $1.50. Again, these full year results translate to 9% non-GAAP EPS growth from prior year actual results for what is now the third consecutive year. Most importantly, we have rebased our long-term growth targets off these higher earning levels each year. Consistent with this practice, we are reaffirming our 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63, which would equate to an 8% growth rate at the midpoint from our higher base of $1.50. Beyond 2024, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS at the mid- to high end of the 6% to 8% range annually through 2030 and continuing to grow dividends per share in line with earnings growth.\nChris will provide additional details regarding our financial results and earnings guidance later. Now I want to discuss the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi Gas LDCs we announced this morning. We anticipate closing the sale in late first quarter of next year, and it is anticipated to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1 billion which equates to an earnings multiple of approximately 32x 2023 earnings. This is a terrific outcome for all stakeholders. Again, following the execution of this transaction, we will mark our fourth time over the last few years in which we have recycled transaction sales proceeds to efficiently fund our industry-leading growth plan. Although the transaction is a great outcome, it is always hard to part with a great team as well as great assets. Louisiana, Mississippi are incredible jurisdictions, and we have been privileged to serve those communities over the years.\nI want to share color around the decision to sell these gas LDCs which was driven principally by 3 reasons: first, the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDCs will allow us to efficiently recycle the roughly $1 billion in anticipated after-tax cash proceeds to support our continued capital investment programs. The valuation of about 32x 2023 earnings is approximately 75% more cost effective than issuing our own common stock to support our industry-leading rate base growth and to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. The valuation also illustrates that even in a much different cost of capital environment than our last LDC sale, there continues to be a strong market demand for [indiscernible], particularly for those in high-growth and constructive jurisdictions.\nSecond, we anticipate that the sale of these gas LDCs will allow us to reprioritize approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures to support other jurisdictions. The added benefit of this reallocation of $1 billion of capital investment is that we expect that we will be able to deploy much of it in jurisdictions with less regulatory lag, therefore, enhancing the ongoing earnings power of the company. Third, as we work to optimize our portfolio, it made sense for us to focus our time and resources in jurisdictions where we have both gas and electric service or where we have a larger presence. This transaction will help support our non-GAAP annual EPS growth target of 8% in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% non-GAAP EPS growth range through 2030, while also helping maintain the strength of our balance sheet.\nNow shifting to how this transaction fits within the broader context of our now [ $44 ] billion capital investment plan. Today, we're announcing that once again, we have positively revised our capital investment plan by an increase of $600 million to $44.5 billion through 2030. $100 million of this increase was already deployed in the fourth quarter of this year, which brought the total capital investments in 2023 to $4.3 billion for the benefit of our customers. This represents a nearly 20% increase over the $3.6 billion we originally guided to at the beginning of 2023. We made the decision to increase the amount of planned work on our systems, principally related to critical investments to improve resiliency and reliability in our Houston Electric service territory. We did this knowing we would be able to efficiently fund these investments once the announced sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi gas LDCs closed. [indiscernible] this increased capital spend is that it will also help offset the loss of approximately $800 million of rate base that we have invested in those states today. Today's capital increase will be focused on investments in system resiliency at Houston Electric in response to the resiliency bill that was enacted in 2023 by the Texas legislature as well as targeted investments in our gas businesses.\nThese resiliency investments at Houston Electric will support the prioritizing of operational programs that modernize, harden and enhance the resiliency and reliability of our transmission and distribution system, such as asset hardening, distribution automation devices and substation flood mitigation. We look forward to filing our multiyear resiliency plan likely early in the second quarter of this year and sharing further details on our next earnings call. Before I move on from this capital investment conversation, I want to make a few comments around our modest [ pay ] and our long-term financing plans moving which Chris will cover in more detail momentarily. In addition to the efficient recycling of strategic transaction proceeds [indiscernible] earlier, we are also planning to incorporate approximately $250 million of annual equity or equity-like funding needs into our long-term financing plans moving forward.\nThis is to allow us to continue to fund our growing capital plans, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and address incremental annual cash needs that Chris will describe shortly. Lastly, before turning it over to Chris, I want to provide some color on our rate cases and put into context what is a relatively busy regulatory calendar. I think it's important to remember the place where we start from. That although greater than 80% of total enterprise rate base is located in jurisdictions where we are anticipated to have rate cases in the next 12 months. We are uniquely positioned in that most of the investments have already been through some regulatory review. As we've stated previously, over 80% of our capital expenditures are recovered through interim trackers and as such, are already in rates. This is a key differentiator from rate cases in other jurisdictions.\nNow turning to our largest jurisdiction, Houston Electric. On our previous call, we indicated that we had requested an extension to file our Houston Electric rate case from March 9 to the second quarter of this year. However, in the January PUCT open meeting, the commission decided to stay with the original March 9, 2024 deadline as ordered in the last rate case. While we [ deferred ] the extended filing date that was supported by all parties in the case, we will be prepared to file the case in early March and anticipate a relatively flat revenue requirement increase. At the same January open meeting, the PUCT finalized its rule-making for house bill 2555 better known as the Resiliency Bill.\nAs you may recall from our previous earnings call, the resiliency bill allows Texas TDUs to file a multiyear resiliency plan that would allow for the recovery of certain costs through riders or regulatory assets. For Houston Electric, these investments are expected to include investments in upgrading distribution lines, building new and upgrading older substations and upgrading our transmission system. These upgrades should help support fewer and shorter unplanned outages, faster renovation response time and greater accuracy with respect to our restoration times. Additionally, the rulemaking in its final form allows for deferral of certain costs such as depreciation and a return on our cost of capital associated with distribution investments and resiliency between the time the assets are placed in service and when rates are updated for those investments. This final rule is beneficial in reducing regulatory lag on these critical investments.\nWe initially indicated we would make our filing towards the end of the first quarter. However, as the final room making was slightly delayed, our filing will likely be submitted early in the second quarter. Now I'll highlight our 3 recently filed rate cases. In our other electric jurisdiction in Indiana, we filed our rate case in the first week of December with a requested revenue requirement increase of approximately $119 million distributed over the next 3 years. Much of this requested revenue requirement increase is associated with our investments in connection with a generation transition plan as we move away from coal to a more efficient and cost-effective field types such as renewables and natural gas.\nAs a reminder, we plan to fully exit operating coal generation by the end of 2027. These investments are a continuation of our prudent investing in Indiana as we strive to also keep customer bills affordable. In fact, since rates went into effect from our last rate case in 2009, customer charges have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 0.5%, well below our peers in the state, which range between 1.7% and 4.7% over that same period of time. Absent a settlement, we expect a final decision in this case in Q4 of this year.\nMoving on to Texas Gas. We filed our Texas Gas rate case towards the end of October with a requested revenue requirement increase of approximately $37 million. As a reminder, we combined all 4 of our Texas jurisdictions into a single rate case filing. This combined filing should not only result in a reduced number of filings on a go-forward basis. But in the near term, it should also result in declining bills from many of our customers, specifically those located in more rural areas. We have a third settlement conference later this month, and we look forward to continuing to work towards a constructive resolution of this case. Absent the settlement, we expect a final decision in the middle of the year.\nFinally, turning to our Minnesota gas business. We filed our rate case on November 1 with the requested revenue increases of approximately $85 million and $52 million for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Interim rates for 2024 were approved in mid-December and went into effect on January 1. The commission will consider interim rates for 2025 towards the end of this year if we have not settled the case before then. This is the first time we have filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota with the goal of providing smoother revenue increases for the benefit of our customers in the future. The majority of the requested revenue requirement increase could be attributed to the fundamental safety programs we operate as well as some of the projects which we filed for under the Natural Gas Innovation Act.\nLastly, I want to mention that we have one other rate case we will be filing in 2024 in our Ohio Gas business. We anticipate filing this rate case midyear, and we'll provide more details as we get closer to the filing. We look forward to working with all of our stakeholders to reach constructive resolutions to all of our rate cases. We believe we are well positioned in all of our cases as we've made prudent investments for our customers and we've made concerted efforts to produce controllable O&M for the benefit of our customers. I realize that is a lot of information. But given the relevance of the rate cases to all stakeholder groups and our intense focus on successfully executing this activity, I believe it's important to cover it and some depth with you. Those are all of my updates for now with a strong foundation of a simple, focused plan to drive value for all stakeholders.\n2023 was another great year here at CenterPoint as we continue a long track record of consistent execution. I am confident in our path forward as we reaffirm our commitment to our proven strategy into our long-term non-GAAP EPS growth guidance target of 8% in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2025 through 2030. I want to thank all of our employees, but especially those on the front lines as they worked hard to provide service to our customers even as we faced a historically hot summer in our Houston Electric service territory, damaging severe storms in Indiana and extreme cold throughout our service territories this winter. 2024 will no doubt bring its own unique challenges, but I am confident we have the right team in place here to manage through them.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Chris for his financial update.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. I want to echo Jason's sentiments regarding the team's performance this year, seeing them go above and beyond to deliver for our customers, even in some of the most challenging situations. Their dedication and focus have certainly contributed to our delivery of financial results and operational performance outcomes that improve the customer experience. Today, I'll cover 4 areas of focus. First, the details of our fourth quarter and annual results. Second, I'll provide additional color around our thoughts regarding the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi LDCs. Third, an update regarding our positively revised capital plan. And lastly, an update of where we stand with our balance sheet and credit metrics.\nLet's start with the financial results on Slide 8. As Jason highlighted earlier, Q4 and full year 2023 with another strong year of financial performance here at CenterPoint. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2023. As previously noted, our non-GAAP EPS results for the fourth quarter removed the results of our net invested nonregulated business, Energy Systems Group. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.32 for the fourth quarter of 2023 and compared to $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2022. With this latest quarter of strong financial performance, we are right at the midpoint of our upperly revised non-GAAP EPS guidance target range of $1.50 for the year. Taking a closer look at the quarter, growth and rate recovery contributed $0.05, which was driven by the ongoing recovery from various interim mechanisms for which customer rates were updated earlier in the year such as the transmission tracker or TCOS at Houston Electric, the DCRF, for which rates were updated in September and the Texas Gas Grips.\nIn addition, we continue to see strong organic growth in the Houston area, extending the long-term trend of 1% to 2% average annual customer growth, which continues to benefit both customers and investors. Weather and usage were $0.01 unfavorable when compared to the same quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the milder winter weather experienced in both our Houston Electric and Indiana Electric service territories. O&M was $0.01 unfavorable for the fourth quarter and $0.01 favorable for the full year 2023. The Q4 figure was primarily due to the increase in vegetation management, which began in Q3 and continued into Q4. We saw these expenditures as prudent given the heightened recent drought conditions and other targeted gas and electric projects that should help us improve safety and reliability for our customers. However, even in light of pulling forward O&M, we were still able to achieve a net annual savings.\nLastly, I want to touch on a favorable onetime item related to an income tax benefit, which was recorded in the fourth quarter, which constitutes the majority of our other favorable drivers. Due to the number of divestitures over the last few years, our state income tax footprint has changed. This change in footprint has resulted in a reduced blended state income tax rate, and we now anticipate paying fewer state income to cash taxes on a go-forward basis. Under GAAP, this reduced blended tax rate necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred taxes, which resulted in the onetime income tax benefit. Additionally, the onetime earnings benefit represents future cash tax savings that will provide an additional source of future incremental cash flow to be invested back into our regulated businesses for the benefit of customers. Closing out the earnings drivers for the quarter, favorability from rate recovery and the income tax benefit was partially offset by a $0.05 increase in interest expense.\nThe primary driver of this was the approximately $6 billion in debt issuances since Q4 of last year with higher coupon rates. However, the impact of this increase was partially offset by the redemption of the $800 million Series A preferred that occurred in September, which eliminated the approximately $12 million quarterly dividend. I'll discuss our long-term financing plan and balance sheet in greater detail shortly. Informing our plan was the transaction we announced this morning related to the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDCs. I'd like to take a bit of time to talk about our thinking here. We were focused on both efficient capital redeployment and investing thoughtfully to eliminate direct earnings implications from the loss on rate base.\nAs you heard Jason mentioned earlier, we have signed an agreement to sell these quality LDCs, which is anticipated to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1 billion. This represents an earnings multiple of nearly 32x based on 2023 earnings. This is a tremendous outcome even when compared to the multiple at which trade today and one that demonstrates the continued market demand for gas LDCs. We assume the closing of this transaction will occur towards the end of the first quarter in 2025. These cash proceeds are expected to provide greater financing flexibility and efficiencies for our capital investments for both our gas and electric businesses throughout the remainder of the capital plan. I want to be clear that we do not see a change in our earnings nor are we making a downward revision to our capital investment targets through 2030 as a result of this transaction. In fact, as I'll touch on more in a moment, we are increasing our 10-year capital plan target by $600 million in aggregate despite serving 2 fewer jurisdictions going forward.\nThis brings our total capital target to $44.5 billion through 2030. Following on Jason's remarks, in 2023 alone, we invested $700 million above what we guided to at the beginning of the year. Much of this spend helped to backfill the rate base that would be lost in this transaction. This allowed us to make much-needed investments in ongoing projects in resiliency and reliability. And although we recognize this temporarily increased our reliance on the balance sheet in the interim, our investment also helped to synchronize capital deployment to prepare for this transaction. This spend supports a consistent ongoing commitment to and confidence in our earnings profile with no interruption expected to our long-term earnings targets.\nMoving on to capital investments. I'll now focus a bit on our capital execution in 2023 and the increase in our 10-year capital plan target shown here on Slide 9. The fourth quarter of 2023 represented yet another quarter of sound capital investment execution by the team here as we invested $900 million for the benefit of our customers and communities bringing our 2023 capital deployment total to $4.3 billion. Given the broader economic impacts our customers are experiencing, we continue to be focused on affordability from both an O&M and an ongoing targeted capital perspective. Even with the incremental capital investment, we continue to estimate our growth in customer delivery charges at Houston Electric to be equal to or less than the historic inflation rate of 2% through 2030. We have confidence in our ability to achieve this. Given the size of the Houston Electric customer base and its tremendous organic growth, securitization charges that are rolling off the bill later this year and our plan to reduce O&M as I referenced.\nReducing O&M will continue to be a focus while we execute our core work plan to meet our customers' needs. As we look over the last 3 years, even with the opportunity to complete more maintenance work on the system, we have successfully reduced O&M at about 2% per year on average over that period, which is the high end of our target. And we are just getting started on using [ Lean ] as a methodology throughout the organization, which we expect to help us continue to reduce O&M and enhance the effectiveness of the capital we deploy. But even in its early stages, we are already seeing results. One recent example that comes to mind comes from our electric business. Through a review of recent reliability outcomes and the associated processes, we identified an internal standard that generated multiple truck rolls to the same location for the same issue. This had nothing to do with the issue not being addressed and fixed after the first visit, but was an internal standard that was resulting in multiple truck rolls.\nThe team is now implementing a modified standard that gives our frontline crews the ability to assess and address the work, mitigating additional truck rolls and providing a better customer experience. This is just a small but meaningful example of improving customer outcomes while also being more efficient in our O&M activities. We certainly appreciate the focus of our teams on the customer and doing the right work while also eliminating the rework along the way. Here on Slide 13, you can see the cumulative effect. This illustrates a rare attribute in our sector. The charges associated with the work we deliver on our customers' bills as a state essentially flat over the last 10 years. We are proud and fortunate to serve a thriving community where we seek to thoughtfully invest in key infrastructure doing our part to enable the economic development of our region.\nAs we look further out into the plan, I want to provide some additional insight into and address our evolving tax profile, to how we're thinking about the financing of our plan. First, the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi LDCs is expected to provide greater financing flexibility over the course of our plan as we look to deploy those proceeds as well as reallocate the capital previously associated with those businesses. We are also now assuming moderate pressure coming from evolving tax policy. In particular, this relates to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, unlike many others in the sector, CenterPoint has historically been a cash taxpayer. On a prospective basis, given the current guidance, we now assume that our base case is that we are subject to AMT. However, as we look to the future, we anticipate a cash tax liability that will be partially offset by the credit generated from paying AMT, allowing us to monetize these payments.\nWe expect this cash tax liability will largely be driven by our income tax liability generated from operations and the tax liability associated with the maturity of our ZENS instrument that matures in 2029. I would think of this as simply prepaying cash tax liabilities associated with our ZENS instrument. With respect to funding incremental cattle, our funding strategy introduced last quarter remains unchanged. As we continue to identify and acute incremental capital, equity or equity-like funding would be required, and I'll reiterate that you should assume this equity funding should be in line with our consolidated capital structure. So as we look to fund the incremental $600 million announced today, of which $100 million was already deployed in 2023. That would imply that we expect to issue approximately $250 million of equity under our ATM program in 2025 in addition to the $250 million we plan to issue in 2024.\nTo add color to what Jason touched on in his remarks, on a go-forward basis, we anticipate that these modest issuances of roughly $250 million will be programmatic through 2030 as we continue to fund what we anticipate will be expanding capital needs and satisfy our near-term minimum tax obligations. We will be in a better position to provide additional color around our future capital plan and the corresponding financing plan as we get to the other side of our rigs filings. Finally, to highlight the balance sheet and credit strength. As of the end of the year, calculated FFO to debt was 14% delivering the cushion we continue to emphasize. For 2 reasons I'll touch on, we may be in a transitory period for a few quarters, but continue to target FFO to debt through 2030 at our target range of 100 to 150 basis points of cushion to our downgrade threshold of 13%. We are continuing to carry over $400 million of debt at the parent, which was issued to fund our higher equity layer at both Houston Electric and Texas Gas.\nWe believe these are the proper capitalization of these businesses, and we've reflected this in our Texas Gas rate case filing, and we'll do so as well in the CD rate case that we file here in the next few weeks. Additionally, as both Jason and I touched upon we performed much more work in 2023 than we had originally anticipated as we made much needed investments in resiliency and reliability, especially at Houston Electric. The combination of cap structure positioning and the incremental investments is temporarily elevating our debt on the balance sheet, which we felt comfortable with as we anticipate cash coming in the door from the sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi LDCs and the recovery of those investments. An area in which we've seen improvement is the continued reduction of our exposure to floating rate debt. We reduced floating rate debt to approximately $1.9 billion in 2023, which represents close to a nearly 60% reduction when compared to 2022.\nThis includes the floating rate note of $350 million at 5.99%, which matures soon. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet throughout this interest rate environment. We believe we have built in conservatism into our long-term plan and today shows another step in progressing that plan for customers, investors. Today's announcement and capital allocation focuses on planning for the long term into jurisdictions with solidly improving regulatory recovery and shared large growing customer bases. This only serves to strengthen an already great plan and execute even in the face of continued headwinds for the benefit of customers and investors. With 3 consecutive years of 9% growth behind us, we continue to reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS target of 8% this year and the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% thereafter through 2030.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Chris. I look forward to leading this company for many years to come in executing what I believe to be one of the best, most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry. I am confident in our team and the organization's continued improvement to enhance an already strong track record of delivering for all of our stakeholders.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGreat. Thank you, Jason. Operator, we're now prepared to take Q&A."

We use our website to announce material information.\nThis call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Before we review our third quarter results, I'd like to touch on the leadership transition announcement we made earlier today.\nAs you've seen, effective January 5, 2024, Jason Wells will succeed me as CEO and a member of the Board. It has been a great personal and professional experience to work alongside him and our very talented executive team. I am incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished together in the past 3.5 years, as we worked hard to position the company to achieve the premium market valuation we have today.\nWe could not have done it without the support and buy-in of our management team and all of our great employees. I have full confidence that Jason is the right person to take the helm. And given how far we come now is the right time to advance this transition.\nAs our very strong third quarter results demonstrate, we have great momentum and a solid foundation in place. Making this change at the beginning of 2024 allows Jason and the team to hit the ground running. And as you will hear shortly, this move has no impact on our financial plans, capital growth plans nor impacts the great opportunities ahead for CenterPoint.\nI have no doubt about CenterPoint's ability to continue to outperform. I'm looking forward to working closely with Jason and the rest of the management team to support a seamless transition.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jason for a few comments.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Dave. I am honored and excited for the opportunity to lead and serve CenterPoint and all of its stakeholders into this next chapter.\nFor my first day at the company, I've worked with Dave and our Board of Directors to reshape and launch our utility-focused strategy.\nI've also been fortunate to have worked alongside Dave in our pursuit of a track record of consistent execution to unlock value.\nI appreciate the board's confidence in me, and I'm thrilled with the opportunity to work alongside this talented team we have here at CenterPoint to continue enhancing and executing on one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry.\nI am confident that with our team who puts our customers at the heart of all we do, the opportunities ahead are boundless. I look forward to spending the next few months continuing to engage with our stakeholders and sharing my vision for the company's great future as we continue to be laser focused on providing outstanding service to our customers and communities, and executing consistently to deliver enhanced stakeholder value.\nNow before I turn it back over to Dave to kick off the discussion of our strong third quarter results, I want to personally thank him for his tireless leadership, mentorship and friendship. He is a force for change and I look forward to building off the momentum he has created.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. Now let's turn to what was a great quarter.\nI'm excited to announce that despite the continued headwinds the industry faces, our Q3 2023 represents our 14th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding expectations here at CenterPoint.\nAnd as you probably saw from the results published this morning, this quarter can squarely be put in the, not only meets, but exceeds column. And as I did last quarter, I will share the quarter's headlines.\nHeadline 1, strong financial results, even with ongoing macro headwinds. Despite the persistent inflation across the economy and increasing interest rate headwinds, we were able to deliver $0.40 of non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter of 2023. This represents a 25% increase over the comparable quarter of 2022.\nHeadline 2, strong Q3 results give us visibility and confidence to increase full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $1.48 to $1.50 to $1.49 to $1.51 per share. At the new and higher midpoint, this projected increase would represent a 9% growth over 2022. This would also be our third consecutive year of 9% growth, and our third consecutive year with a compounding beat and raise, reflecting our ongoing strong execution.\nIn addition, we yet again increased our dividend this quarter from $0.19 to $0.20, which represents a 10% increase over the last 12 months, one of the highest increases in the sector. These are just outstanding results.\nHeadline 3, initiating 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.61 to $1.63 per share. Our new 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance range represents an 8% growth over the midpoint of our new and now higher 2023 guidance range of $1.49 to $1.51. This continues to reflect the compounding effects of our 3 years of expected beat and raise results, and is due to excellent execution over the past several years.\nAs we've said previously, we continue to target year-over-year growth to deliver value to our customers and investors each and every year. We are also demonstrating that we continue to have upside to our previously stated annual growth targets.\nHeadline 4, another upward revision to our capital plan. We continue to be prudent and formally incorporating incremental capital into our plan. We will not deviate from our practice of only adding in incremental investments when we believe we can operationally execute them, efficiently fund them and effectively recover them.\nI am delighted to say today that we now have line of sight to increase our capital plan by an additional $500 million. This brings our total 10-year capital plan due 2030 to nearly $44 billion, supporting a 10% rate base CAGR throughout that same period. Better yet, this amount also includes an increase to our 2023 plan from $4 billion to $4.2 billion. This represents a nearly 17% increase since our beginning of the year target of $3.6 billion. The remaining incremental $300 million will be deployed in 2024 and 2025.\nThese additional capital investments will continue to support safety, reliability and resiliency for the benefit of customers, while balancing the impact on their bills.\nChris will discuss the funding of this incremental capital a little later in his remarks.\nHeadline 5, O&M discipline continues to help results and benefit customers. We continue on a path of reducing O&M costs by 1% to 2% per year on average over our current 10-year plan. We have successfully been able to reduce overall O&M on an annual basis even in years when we have pulled forward O&M. This benefits all of our stakeholders.\nThis year's strong results will allow us to pull approximately $0.03 of O&M into '23 from 2024.\nNow over time, we've discussed a lot of pluses, minuses and pull forwards to our O&M in our earnings calls over the past 3 years. And sometimes it's easy to get lost in the weeds on our great progress, and we do see in O&M. In fact, that happens to me at times. But here is the bottom line that you should focus on. Even with higher inflation, we are now on track to have reduced total controllable O&M from $1.46 billion to $1.28 billion since the beginning of 2021, a reduction of over 12%.\nHeadline 6. Our 4 upcoming rate case filings remain on track with a slight modification to the timing of our Houston Electric rate case. With the support of key stakeholders, we are requesting a shift to the timing of our CE rate case. With PUCT approval, we will seek to file a couple of months later to allow the use of a calendar year test year which should simplify the filing for all parties. Jason will get into that in a few minutes.\nHeadline 7, Houston growth continues at a blistering pace. The Houston area has seen a nearly 15% increase in housing starts through the first 3 quarters of 2023. This activity continues to support our annual 1% to 2% organic customer growth that benefits customer charges. In fact, 10 years ago, our average monthly customer charges were approximately $49. Today, even after historic inflation, our monthly charge is still that same $49. This is a testament to benefits of the decades-long 2% organic customer growth here in the Houston area.\nHeadline 8, still targeting Houston Electric customer charges at or below the 2% historical rate of inflation. While continuing to heavily invest in the fundamentals of safety, resiliency and reliability, our goal is to keep Houston Electric customer charge increases at or below the 2% historical level of inflation over the longer term.\nIn summary, balancing the economic headwinds such as higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, with the tailwinds of unseasonably warm weather, especially in our Houston service territory, we continue to deliver for both our customers and investors.\nThe third quarter of 2023 highlights this management team's commitment and ability to execute even through adverse macro conditions. We continue to believe that we have one of the most tangible, long-term growth plans in the industry. And we believe we have the right team in place to extend our track record of execution.\nBefore I hand it over to Jason and Chris, I want to express my sincere appreciation to all employees here at CenterPoint that endured extreme weather conditions this summer to keep the power on for our customers when it mattered most.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Dave. Before I get into my updates for the quarter, I also want to extend my gratitude to all of our employees who work through the challenging weather and economic conditions this summer to provide exceptional service to our customers. .\nNow looking at the regulatory calendar on Slide 5. I want to provide an update regarding the timing of our 4 upcoming rate case filings, beginning with the first 1 of 2 that will be filed next week. That is our Texas gas rate case.\nFor the benefit of our customers, and to reduce administrative burden on all of our stakeholders, for the first time, we will be combining our 4 Texas gas jurisdictions into a single rate case filing. We expect that this combined filing will result in reduced monthly bills for certain customers, specifically to those in our smaller rural Texas gas areas of our service territory, as well as our large commercial and industrial users. Those residential customers in more urban areas are anticipated to see a moderate overall monthly bill increase.\nAdditionally, this single filing will simplify future consolidated annual [indiscernible] filings from 4 to 1 per year.\nMoving on to our other Texas business, Houston Electric. We are now targeting the second quarter of 2024 to file our rate cases. We had previously guided to the first quarter of 2024. However, to simplify the case for all stakeholders, we now anticipate using a calendar test year ending December 31, 2023, rather than the previously contemplated test year-end of September 30, 2023.\nThe shift to a calendar test year reduces the administrative burden for all parties. Given the anticipated new test period end date, we wanted to ensure that we had enough time to compile our filing. While we're still developing the parameters, we are still anticipating the rate case to have a relatively flat revenue requirement and look forward to highlighting the large O&M reductions we've been able to achieve, which will be a key contributor to the expected revenue requirement.\nIn our Minnesota Gas and Indiana Electric businesses, we don't anticipate any changes to the timing of our filings as we continue to target early November, December of this year, respectively, for those filings.\nAlthough we don't expect the timing of the Minnesota rate case to change, the structure of our filing will, we are planning to file a 2-year forward-looking rate case instead of a 1-year rate case, which we've historically filed. This change will allow us to file for a revenue increase for the second year and maintain those rates to the next rate case, putting us on an expected path to smooth revenue increases for the benefit of our customers.\nAdditionally, given the filing will cover a longer period, it will naturally result in fewer rate case filings, lessening the administrative burden for all stakeholders.\nMoving to the regulatory updates shown on Slide 6. Outside of our rate cases, during the quarter, we began to recover on our interim mechanisms at Houston Electric. The first interim mechanism related to our distribution investments, known as the DCRF, which went into rates on September 1 with an annual revenue requirement increase of $70 million. The $70 million increase relates to our distribution investments made during calendar year 2022.\nAs many of you are aware, recently enacted legislation now enables Texas utilities to make 2 such filings per year instead of the 1 we were previously allowed. This should allow for the reduction of regulatory lag associated with our future distribution capital spend at Houston Electric as we continue to make customer-driven investments.\nThe second interim mechanism that also went into rates relates to our recently settled emergency generation or T filing, which like the DCRF, was included in customer rates beginning on September 1. This is a tremendously constructive outcome for our customers. These emergency generation assets can be deployed during some of the most critical times like extended outages caused by severe weather events that occur in the Houston area.\nAs power resiliency and reliability remain a key focus of ours and the communities we serve, we will continue to advocate for these customer-focused outcomes.\nI want to take a moment and highlight that although we continue to make these customer-driven investments in resiliency and reliability, which in aggregate, equates to over $300 million in incremental revenue, we are still mindful of the impacts to customer charges.\nAs Dave said, 10 years ago, our average monthly delivery customer charges were approximately $49 a month. Today, even after historic inflation, our average monthly delivery charge is still that same $49. This is a testament to benefits of the tremendous organic customer growth here in the Houston area as well as our disciplined focus on managing O&M.\nLastly, I'd like to provide an update regarding the generation transition in Indiana. We had filed for cost increases associated primarily with the increased cost in solar panels and MISO interconnection costs. This quarter, we have received reapproval for Posey Solar, which is one of our 200-megawatt utility-owned solar projects.\nWe are also revising the place in service dates for 2 of our renewable generation projects that are now expected to be operational in 2026, which were previously anticipated to go into service in 2025. These delays come in with these types of projects are due to increased pricing and the long queue for MISO interconnects, among other factors.\nAs we've said before, in instances of delayed projects, we will work to sequence our other capital deployment opportunities to eliminate any earnings impact to our plan.\nWe want to recognize the Indiana Commission who continues to work to balance all stakeholder input of our ongoing energy transition as we work towards moving away from more costly coal generation to cleaner, lower-cost generation investments in wind, solar and natural gas.\nThose are my updates for the quarter. I am proud of our operational execution, especially in light of the extreme weather some of our jurisdictions endured during the quarter.\nOur Houston Electric service territory experienced 12 new record demand peaks. Our crews restore transmission lines to mitigate generation congestion, provided relief through voltage reduction and organizationally took a leading role in socializing the need for customer energy conservation.\nThrough these efforts, we were able to not only keep the power on for our customers, but also manage our O&M while doing so, benefiting future customer rates.\nAlthough our sector continues to face headwinds, I am still firmly in the belief that our tailwinds, such as efficient capital deployment, strong organic growth and O&M reduction opportunities, exceed our headwinds.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Chris to provide his financial update for the quarter.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nBefore I get started on the financial results, Dave, thank you for your support of me as I sought to hit the ground running. And Jason, congratulations to you. .\nToday, I'll cover 3 areas of focus. First, our Q3 results, including our positive revision to 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance and the initiation of 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Second, our positively revised capital plan and corresponding financing plan. And third, a look at where we stand today with respect to our balance sheet.\nNow let's start with the financial results on Slide 7. As Dave mentioned in his headlines, with 3 quarters of 2023 behind us, we now have the visibility and confidence to provide an upward revision to our full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $1.48 to $1.50 per share, to $1.49 to $1.51 per share. This increased guidance range reflects projected 9% growth over full year 2022 actual non-GAAP EPS of $1.38 when using the midpoint. This would represent our third consecutive year of 9% growth.\nOn a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.40 for the third quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP EPS results for the third quarter removed the results of our now divested nonregulated business, Energy Systems Group.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, we also reported $0.40 for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $0.32 in the third quarter of 2022.\nGrowth in rate recovery contributed $0.09, which was driven by the ongoing recovery of various interim mechanisms for which customer rates were updated earlier in the year, such as the transmission tracker or TCOS at Houston Electric and the Texas grids.\nAlso contributing, and as Jason noted earlier, during the quarter, we began recovery of 2 separate mechanisms at Houston Electric, DCRF and TEEEF. In addition, we continue to see strong organic growth in the Houston area, extending the long-term trend of 1% to 2% average annual customer growth, which continues to benefit both customers and investors.\nWeather and usage were $0.05 favorable when compared to the same quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the historic summer heat in our Houston Electric service territory. This Q3 warmer weather impact partially offset the unfavorable cooler weather impact of $0.06 we experienced in Q1 and Q2 of this year.\nO&M was flat for the third quarter and $0.02 favorable year-to-date when comparing to the first 3 quarters of 2022. And we remain laser-focused on reducing O&M by 1% to 2% per year on average, while executing our core work plan to meet our customers' needs. In fact, due to the favorable impact from the weather, we were able to increase Q3 spending on certain O&M items for the benefit of our customers. These O&M activities included accelerated vegetation management, which we see as prudent, given the heightened recent drought conditions, and other targeted projects that should help us improve safety and reliability for our customers.\nOur consistent progress on O&M is clear. Over the last couple of years, we have been able to use hotter summers to increase our spend on O&M for the benefit of our customers. However, when looking at our current O&M trajectory, even with this increased spend, we are anticipating reducing controllable O&M by over 12% since 2021.\nThese are excellent results for customers and investors alike. We continue to look for and execute on additional opportunities each year.\nClosing out the earnings drivers for the quarter, favorability from rate recovery and weather were partially offset by an $0.08 increase in interest expense. The continued rising interest rate expense on short-term borrowings was the primary driver for this unfavorability when compared to the third quarter of last year.\nHowever, we continue to be opportunistic in reducing short-term floating rate debt exposure. I'll discuss this in greater detail in just a moment.\nLet me now focus a bit on our 2023 capital plan, which you can see here on Slide 8. The third quarter of 2023 represents yet another quarter of sound capital deployment execution as we invested $1.1 billion for the benefit of our customers and communities. This brings our year-to-date total investments to $3.4 billion year-to-date across our various service territories, or over 80% of 2023 capital plan.\nAdditionally, as Dave mentioned in his headlines, we are now able to incorporate an additional $200 million of customer-focused investments in 2023, which increases our full year 2023 capital plan from $4 billion to $4.2 billion.\nLet me provide a little context around this update. This year saw a couple of operational factors beyond the second DCRF law that benefited us. First, we did not experience the temporary loss of our great frontline crews to mutual aid requests as there were not major weather events that activated that need. With those crews at the ready to execute more work, we were able to support our continued customer growth of over 2% in our Texas Electric business, as well as advanced some of our pipeline modernization work at our Texas gas business as opposed to waiting until next year.\nI'm proud of the team's ability to be nimble in this way as we continue to invest in safety, reliability and resiliency for our customers.\nNow turning to our 2024 non-GAAP earnings guidance. As we enter the final quarter of 2023, with confidence in our ability to deliver strong full year results, we are already looking to next year. And going forward, we would intend for our traditional rhythm to be to provide subsequent year non-GAAP EPS guidance for you in the third quarter of the prior year.\nAnd as a result, today, we are initiating our 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63 per share. This would represent an 8% earnings growth over our now higher expected 2023 earnings midpoint.\nBeyond 2024, we continue to target the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% non-GAAP EPS growth through 2030. We also target growing dividends in line with earnings, and as some of you may have noticed, we took the step to increase our dividend this quarter from $0.19 to $0.20, which represents a 10% increase over the last 12 months, one of the highest increases in the sector.\nSupporting this 2024 growth is our now revised capital plan. For 2024, we are targeting to deploy $3.7 billion of customer-driven capital to support the growth, resiliency and safety of our system for our customers.\nOn top of the incremental $200 million added to the 2023 capital plan, we will add approximately $300 million of incremental capital to the existing $43.4 billion 10-year capital plan through 2030. This brings our new total amount to $43.9 billion. This $300 million is anticipated to be deployed in 2024 and 2025.\nAllow me a minute to step back and give all of you a feel for our thinking here on the [indiscernible] revision. It's much like we've said before, we need to be able to efficiently execute fund and recover our costs as we think about including more capital for customers.\nThis additional capital represents our move to take advantage of a few factors. First, we have the opportunity to provide it by the recent resiliency legislation that passed in the Texas legislature, where we can start to pull some of that work into play soon. And the team has come a long way on better capital execution in recent years.\nI want to take a moment and put in perspective just how far we've progressed in our capital plan since our last Analyst Day in 2021. The new $43.9 billion capital plan through 2030 is nearly 10% higher than the $40 billion-plus plan we outlined when we hosted that Analyst Day. And with our revised 2023 capital target, we will have deployed over $12.5 billion in capital since the beginning of 2021, over $1 billion more than our then market capitalization.\nAdditionally, the 5-year capital target of $18 billion plus communicated back in 2021, which now stands at over $21 billion, represents over a 16% increase in capital. At that same prior Analyst Day, we also announced that we did not need any equity to fund our $40 billion-plus capital plan nor did we need equity to fund the previous increases to $43.4 billion. And that was still the case when we referenced our most recent revision to $43.4 billion, in part due to the financing lift from the noncore ESG transaction we announced in the last quarter.\nHowever, as we have previously said, as our capital plan grows and as we began to spend incremental capital beyond the $43.4 billion plan, equity or equity-like funding would be required. And the reason for this is simple. While we are committed to making customer-focused investments for safety, reliability and resiliency, we are equally committed to preserving a strong balance sheet.\nAs we go forward and evaluate acceleration of incremental growth capital additions to our plan, you should assume that we will fund in line with our consolidated capital structure. So it follows today that in order to efficiently fund the $500 million of incremental capital opportunities I discussed a moment ago, we anticipate initiating a modest ATM program in 2024 of approximately $250 million.\nUltimately, we see this capital we highlighted today, along with the ATM, introducing additional flexibility for our future plans. And as we've said before, we will continue to evaluate efficient funding for future incremental capital that we formally fold into the plan.\nTo be clear, any ATM program proceeds are dedicated to enhance growth and incremental capital investments. The equity issued under this program will, in no way, reduce our earnings growth targets through 2030.\nAs discussed, we continue to reaffirm our target ,8% next year and the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% thereafter through 2030.\nWith our revised capital plan, we are still intently focused on delivering work affordably. We continue to target our customer delivery charges at Houston Electric to be equal to or less than historic inflation rate of 2%. We have confidence in our ability to achieve this through Houston's tremendous organic growth, securitization charges rolling off the bill later next year, and our plan to reduce O&M 1% to 2% per year on average.\nA great example of our ability to keep customer charges manageable even as we make our system more resilient can be found in Q3. Even with the recovery of more than $700 million in investments in our temporary emergency generation now being included in customer rates, customer charges have increased at less than an annual average of 1%.\nWe have a strong track record on bringing focus to affordability and smoothing of rates for our customers. Like Dave mentioned earlier, our average charge was $49, 10 years ago, and it's averaging $49 today.\nFinally, I will cover some of our financing and credit related topics on Slide 9. As of the end of the third quarter, our calculated FFO to debt was 14.3%. This represents an expected increase from Q2 as the recovery of our investments accelerates going into the back half of the year.\nWe anticipate this acceleration to continue through Q4 of this year, as we will have a full quarter of recovery on our DCRF and TEEEF investments that we indicated began on September 1.\nWe continue to target FFO to debt of 14% to 15%, which runs through 2030, and importantly, provides at least 100 basis points of cushion to our downgrade threshold of 13%.\nAs a reminder, we are carrying approximately $400 million of debt at the parent, which was issued to fund our higher equity layer at Houston Electric and Texas gas, which we believe is the proper capitalization of these businesses.\nAnother area in which we've seen improvement is the continued reduction of our exposure to floating rate debt. Through the third quarter, we reduced floating rate debt to approximately $1.8 billion, which represents a 60% reduction from the beginning of 2023. We continue to be opportunistic in reducing this balance further, and the convertible bond issuance during this quarter is a great example of capitalizing on opportunities.\nOur $1 billion convertible issuance allowed us to redeem our $800 million Series A preferred shares that were set to go floating during the quarter on September 1 of the year at nearly 9%. So some good opportunistic savings were achieved there. The remaining approximately $200 million of convertible bond proceeds allowed us to pay down commercial paper, contributing to the net reduction of floating rate debt exposure.\nLastly, after quarter close, we issued $450 million of private placement notes at SIGECO. As we've noted in prior quarters, this was an opportunity to fund the entity on a stand-alone basis, rather than relying on intercompany borrowings from the parent.\nOn a go-forward basis, this should translate to a lower relative cost of borrowing versus the parent. And as a result, this reduced parent-level debt to total borrowing by another 2%. This is a milestone as our final step of the [indiscernible] financing integration.\nWe remain intensely focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, especially in what appears to be a higher, longer interest rate environment. We have worked hard to build an additional conservatism in our long-term plan. And today shows another step of progressing that plan for our customers and investors.\nThis shared focus on good planning is what we believe will allow us to continue to execute, even in the face of continued headwinds.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nAs you've heard from us today, we now have 14 straight quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations.\nWe are a pure-play, regulated, premium utility and on a course to continue execution of our current plan with incremental growth opportunities to support our customers well beyond that.\nThank you for listening to me tell our story for the past 3.5 years. This has been a great ride, and I look forward to finding my next opportunity.\nWe also look forward to celebrating Jason's promotion with all of you at [ EEI ].\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Dave. Operator, we'll now turn it back to you for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jackie Richert, Vice President of Corporate Planning, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nWelcome to CenterPoint's Earnings Conference Call. Management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based on various factors as noted in our Form 10-Q, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. When providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of diluted adjusted earnings per share on a consolidated basis referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance please refer to our earnings news release and presentation on our website. We use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you to everyone joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm excited to announce that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding expectations. Additionally, I am pleased to be joined on today's call by Chris Foster, the newest member of our management team. Chris has hit the ground running. I know most of you already knew what a high-quality executive he is and have had the opportunity to catch up with him. We are happy to have him officially onboard. Since we have 3 speakers today instead of our usual too, I will limit my time to providing the main headlines for the quarter and let Jason and Chris tell the story.\nHeadline 1, another great quarter is in the books at CenterPoint as our entire team of nearly 9,000 employees continues to execute well on all fronts. Headline 2, overcoming headwinds reaffirming 2023 guidance. We announced second quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 per share overcoming the $0.08 per share headwind from higher interest expense alone. Other headwinds came from inflationary pressures and generally milder weather throughout our service territories this quarter. Despite these headwinds, we are reaffirming our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance target range of $1.48 to $1.50 per share. This represents an 8% growth over last year's actual amount.\nThis follows non-GAAP EPS earnings growth of 9% in both 2021 and 2022. Headline 3, reaffirming industry-leading long-term growth for 2024 and beyond. We continue to target 8% non-GAAP EPS growth in 2024 and in the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually thereafter through 2030. Headline 4. 2023 capital deployment is on track. We successfully deployed $1.2 billion of capital during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $2.3 billion. This is ahead of our anticipated plans for the year. Headline 5, increasing our 2023 capital spend by over 11%.\nLet me walk you through the new capital plan. Our prior 10-year capital plan was $43 billion with an incremental $3 billion of additional capital spend identified but not yet included in our formal plan. Today, we are increasing our 2023 capital plan from $3.6 billion to $4 billion, an increase of over 11%. We are now confident we can efficiently fund, execute and recover this $400 million increase without any external equity issuance. With this, our formal capital plan through 2030 goes from $43 billion to $43.4 billion. As to the remaining $2.6 billion of capital identified, but not yet included in our $43.4 billion, we are now confident in our ability to identify opportunities well beyond this amount. As we have stated in the past, we will continue to add these incremental amounts to our capital plan when we are confident we can efficiently fund, execute and recover them. As we always do, we will continue to identify and execute on constructive opportunities for all of our stakeholders.\nSo to be clear, this is additional capital spending for 2023, not pulling future capital spending forward. These additional capital investments will support safety and resiliency for the benefit of customers in our Houston Electric business while balancing the impact on their bills. Headline 6, O&M planned reductions remain on target. We continue on a path to reducing O&M cost by 1% to 2% per year on average over the current 10-year plan. Headline 7, positive legislation outcomes from across our territories. There were a number of recent legislative outcomes in Texas and Indiana that should benefit our utility customers for years to come. To name just a few from Texas, we now have the ability to file for 2 DCRF per year, the ability to recover prudent incentive compensation and the ability to file a comprehensive resiliency focused investment plan.\nHeadline 8, Houston growth continues. People and companies continue to flock to Houston, partly because of its affordable and reliable energy. In 2022, the Houston area was the second fastest growing metro area in the U.S. And amazingly, in 2022, over 1/3 of Houston's region population growth was from residents moving to Houston from outside the United States. Headline 9, targeting Houston Electric customer charges at or below the 2% historical rate of inflation while continuing to heavily invest in the fundamentals of safety, resiliency and reliability, we will be aiming to keep Houston Electric customer charge increases at or below the 2% historical level inflation over the longer term. This is a unique luxury among utilities.\nHeadline 10 we plan to be out of operating coal generation by the end of 2027. Using renewables and lower carbon power generation should provide a more affordable alternative for our customers. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees in both Houston and Southwestern Indiana, who worked tirelessly to repair our system that was struck by a series of major storms earlier this month. Also, I want to take a moment to thank the Texas and Indiana legislatures and all stakeholders that supported our constructive legislative outcomes. We are grateful that the resiliency and the reliability of the grid continues to be a top priority for all of our stakeholders.\nIn summary, even in the midst of the economic and operational headwinds of higher interest rates, inflationary pressures and unusual weather, we continue to deliver for both our customers and investors. The second quarter of 2023 is just another example of our continued commitment to executing on what we believe is the most tangible long-term growth plan in the industry. I'll now let Jason and Chris take it from here.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our second quarter call. Before I get into my updates for the quarter, I want to echo Dave's gratitude to all of our employees who withstood this extreme weather to quickly restore service in our greater Houston and Southwest Indiana communities. I couldn't be prouder of our team response and commitment to the communities we have the privilege to serve. Looking at the legislative summary on Slide 5.\nWe are grateful for the customer-focused outcomes resulting from these recent legislative sessions. We understand our state legislatures have numerous issues to consider, and we are appreciative of the time that was spent on providing the electric and gas utility industries with additional tools to better serve our customers. In Texas, One of the top stated goals of the latest legislative session was to improve electric grade reliability, and we certainly believe we made good progress on that front will be an act of a number of bills. There are 3 that I want to highlight in particular.\nFirst, taxes transmission and distribution utilities now have the ability to file a resiliency plan for transmission and distribution-related cost recovery. This comprehensive electric resiliency plan will allow the TDUs to work with the Public Utility Commission of Texas to outline a multiyear investment plan to broadly harden our electric rig to better address the impacts of extreme weather. Additionally, distribution investments under these new plants will be eligible for the deferral of certain carrying costs, such as depreciation and interest expense, helping minimize the regulatory lag and recovery. This builds a great illustration of how our legislators and other stakeholders desire for increased grid resiliency in light of the recent demands on the electric grid and providing the TDUs to do so.\nSecond, we now have the ability to file for recovery of distribution-related capital investments twice per year under the distribution capital recovery trackers or DCRF mechanism. This change now provides parity with the recovery of transmission investments where we already are able to make 2 filings a year. The ability to file 2 DCRF a year will not only help to reduce regulatory lag on the recovery of our distribution investments, but will also help keep incremental bill increases smaller and smoother for our customers. Lastly, we will now be able to recover certain incentive compensation for the employees that serve our customers in the Houston Electric service territory. This will help us continue to attract top talent to better serve our customers. These bills as well as other related bills that were enacted were an overwhelmingly positive outcome for customers and for CenterPoint. And I want to also express appreciation to all stakeholders involved in achieving this. We will continue to work with stakeholders to achieve customer-focused outcomes while advancing the resiliency, reliability and safety of the grid that helps power the economic success of the Greater Houston area.\nOutside of Texas, I want to thank the Indiana legislature for its time and attention in providing Indiana utilities for more opportunities to advocate for their customers. One such piece of legislation that I want to highlight in this regard is one that allows a utility to write a first refusal to building transmission lines that connect to a respective utility system. We believe this allows a utility to operate in the best interest of its customers, a win for those that we serve in Southwestern Indiana. In addition to a busy legislative calendar, we had a number of regulatory updates as shown on Slide 6. Starting\nwith Minnesota Gas, we filed for the approval of 25 proposed projects under the Natural Gas Innovation Act, or NGIA with an estimated cost of a little over $100 million for the first 5 years of those projects. These projects include things like renewable natural gas and green hydrogen as well as pioneering technologies such as a networked geothermal district energy system and end-use carbon capture. These proposed projects are designed with the goal of helping to advance a cleaner energy future in Minnesota. We continue to be appreciative of the constructive environment in Minnesota, which allows us the opportunity to invest in projects that assist our customers to achieve their emission reduction targets.\nNow moving to Indiana Electric. We continue to make good progress related to our 2020 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. During the quarter, we received several approvals from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, including approval for our 200-megawatt wind project and the reapproval of 3 of our solar projects. Additionally, earlier this month, the gas pipeline that will serve the new Gas CT plant, which was approved last year, was fully authorized to proceed by the FERC. Related to our 2020 IRP, we now have received approval and in many instances, reapproval for nearly all of the filings. These filings constitute over 1 gigawatt of renewable generation that we anticipate placing in service or begin contracting within the next few years and the 460-megawatt gas GT which is expected to provide an additional generation source on days when the wind might not be blowing and the sun might not be showing you.\nWe also issued securitization bonds of approximately $340 million related to the retirement of the AB Brown Coal Facility. This was a very constructive transaction for our customers and has already started providing customer benefits in the form of a credit on their bills. With many of the individual projects related to our 2020 IRP underway, we can now turn our attention to 2023 IRP we submitted in the second quarter. This IRP addresses our proposed retirement of our third and final coal facility and places us firmly on a path to fully exiting coal generation we operate by the end of 2027, while offering our customers a cleaner, more reliable, balanced portfolio of solar, wind and gas generation at a cost that is expected to be substantially less than maintaining our existing coal generation fleet. This new filing proposes converting our last coal plant to gas as well as adding 200 megawatts of wage in 200 megawatts of solar by 2030.\nIn its entirety, this IRP is anticipated to save customers nearly $80 million compared to the continued use of coal over the next 20 years. This filing is the culmination of months of hard work and collaboration throughout our organization to arrive at what we believe is a thoughtful and customer-centric approach to the generation transition in Southwest Indiana.\nMoving on to the regulatory calendar shown on Slide 7. As many of you know, we have a number of rate case filings on the horizon. I want to provide a brief update regarding the timing of those filings. Beginning with Texas Gas. We have slightly changed the expected timing of our filing. Previously, we had communicated that we would file this summer. However, we will delay this filing for a few months, likely filing in November of this year. We continue to anticipate filing for a relatively flat revenue requirement despite the delay and look forward to working with all stakeholders to reach a constructive outcome. Additionally, we will likely push the timing of our Houston Electric filing to Q1 of 2024 instead of the previously communicated fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to use our TCOS and DCRF mechanisms until that time. Similarly, we also anticipate filing a relatively flat revenue requirement supported by our O&M discipline and growth throughout our Texas service territory.\nWith respect to the Minnesota and Indiana Electric Filings, we remain on track with our previously communicated time lines of filing both cases towards the end of the fourth quarter this year. Before I turn it over to Chris for the financial updates, I want to take a moment to touch on just how impressed I've been with the initiative and innovation of our leaders to reduce O&M while at the same time, incrementally and positively impacting our customers' experience. One such incremental example can be found in our gas business. Earlier this year, we completed a review focused on finding continuous improvement opportunities in our leak management activities. This review resulted in identifying several million dollars in opportunities that will benefit customers in the future by reducing bill increases, but also freeing up crews to get to service costs faster. It is examples like this that continue to reinforce our confidence in delivering 1% to 2% annual average O&M reductions despite inflationary headwinds. Those are my updates for the quarter. I remain excited about our continued execution for the benefit of our customers and our investors. We continue to focus on making customer-focused investments and working with stakeholders to support legislative and regulatory outcomes that benefit customers throughout our various service territories.\nNow with that, I'll turn it over to Chris for the financial updates.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason, and thanks to all of you for joining our 2023 2nd quarter call and my first earnings call as CFO of this great company. Although I only recently joined the CenterPoint team, I can certainly say that I've enjoyed meeting more of my coworkers digging into the long-term plan and representing the company to the investor community while also getting my family settled here with me as a new set of Houston residents. And I'm really pleased to see the recent outcomes the team has achieved, knowing we still have a number of long-term opportunities that are still very much in front of us. Today, I'll cover 3 areas of focus.\nFirst, our earnings progress, then a financing update, including our Energy Systems Group transaction and further reduction in floating rate debt. And finally, as Dave introduced, a positive revision to our capital plan. Now let's start with the financial results on Slide 8. As mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance range of $1.48 to $1.50 of non-GAAP earnings per share which reflects 8% growth over full year 2022 non-GAAP EPS of $1.38 when using the midpoint. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.17 for the second quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP EPS results for the first quarter removed the results of our now divested nonregulated business, Energy Systems Group.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.28 for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.31 in the second quarter of 2022. Combined with the first quarter, we have now achieved 52% of our full year guidance at the midpoint. Growth in rate recovery contributed $0.07 largely driven by continued recoveries through our electric DCRF capital tracker filed last year and our electric transmission tracker or TCOS in our Houston Electric territory, which went into rates last November. In addition, we continue to see strong organic growth in the Houston area, extending the long-term trend of 1% to 2% average annual growth. O&M was flat for the second quarter and $0.02 favorable year-to-date when compared to the first half of '22 as we continue to find ways to operate more efficiently to target O&M reduction by 1% to 2% per year on average while remaining focused on meeting our customers' needs.\nThese favorable drivers were offset by an $0.08 increase in interest expense. The continued rising interest rate expense on short-term borrowings was the primary driver for this unfavorability when compared to the second quarter of last year. However, we continue to make progress in reducing our short-term floating rate debt exposure, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. We believe our plan has sufficient conservatism built in to help us overcome these ongoing pressures. Weather and usage were $0.02 unfavorable when compared to the same quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a combination of sustained record-breaking temperatures during Q2 of 2022 when compared year-over-year to the milder April and May weather in both our Houston and Indiana Electric territories this year. However, this trend did change in Houston in mid-June.\nNext, I cover some financing and credit-related topics on Slide 9. As of the end of the second quarter, aligning with Moody's methodology, our FFO to debt was 13.9% as reported. We remain focused on the balance sheet as we target 14% to 15% through 2030. Essentially, we are targeting around 150 basis points of cushion from our downgrade threshold of 13%. We will continue to explore opportunities to strengthen the balance sheet in this rising rate environment. Another area in which we've been executing well is in the reduction of our exposure to floating rate debt. In the first quarter, we reduced floating rate debt by nearly $2 billion through the receipt of Winter Storm Uri proceeds and refinancing floating rate debt to fixed term issuances at the operating companies. We carried this momentum into the second quarter as we reduced floating rate debt by an additional $200 million to approximately 14% of total debt outstanding. That's nearly a 50% year-to-date reduction relative to where we ended 2022. The primary drivers of this reduction for the receipt of the approximately $340 million in securitization proceeds related to the retirement of A.B. Brown, the proceeds of the previously mentioned Energy Systems Group, along with the collection of elevated gas costs incurred in the latter part of 2022. As a reminder, we are carrying approximately $400 million of debt at the parent, which was issued to fund our higher equity layer at Houston Electric and Texas Gas as we head into rate cases.\nAnd as we get to the other side of the rate cases, we will either begin recovering at this higher equity content or delever. From the moment I arrived here at CenterPoint, one of my primary areas of focus as we work through our industry-leading growth plan is maintaining the strength of the balance sheet especially in the current interest rate environment. I look forward to working with the team here not only to execute one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry, but also maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nComing back to the divestiture of Energy Systems Group. We divested one of our few remaining nonregulated businesses, Energy Systems Group, or ESG, and closed the transaction within Q2. ESG and energy services business that implement efficiency solutions through infrastructure and other solutions. It was acquired in the Vectron acquisition in 2019 and was part of its nonregulated portfolio. However, as we've sharpened our focus on our regulated utility businesses, it made sense to find a more natural owner for this business. As a result of this divestiture, today, nonregulated businesses account for less than 5% of our earnings. We're grateful to the employees for their tremendous work and believe they'll have further success under their new owners. We received after-tax proceeds of $121 million from the sale of ESG. The combination of these proceeds as well as those received from the Indiana securitization will help to reduce near-term floating rate debt exposure as well as provide incremental financing flexibility to help fund our capital plan including the additional $400 million capital investments we anticipate making this year.\nLet me now focus a bit on our CapEx enhancements on Slide 10. For the benefit of our customers and communities, we invested $1.2 billion this quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date across our various service territories. This represents 64% of our beginning of the year target of $3.6 billion for 2023. We are updating our 2023 capital target from $3.6 billion to $4 billion. This results in an increase to $43.4 billion for our 10-year capital plan target that goes through 2030. This capital increase is a result of having greater visibility operationally to resource additional work and improvements to financing and recoveries. As it relates to the remainder of the balance of the $2.6 billion in incremental capital opportunities, that we have not yet incorporated into the plan, as Dave said.\nWe are now confident in our ability to identify opportunities well beyond this amount. We have communicated that we will include incremental amounts when we can operationally execute, efficiently fund and efficiently recover. We have also stated that the previous $43 billion capital plan we set forth through 2030 does not require external equity funding. The remainder of the incremental amounts beyond today's increase will require some additional financing that is not currently contemplated or reflected in our plan. As we continue to evaluate when to fall in the remaining $2.6 billion and beyond, we will also target the optimal way to finance such investments. Our focus on delivering work affordably has not changed, and we will seek to continue to prudently deploy this capital while being mindful of customer charges. We continue to target our customer charges at Houston Electric to be equal to or less than the historical inflation rate of 2%.\nWe believe we are able to achieve this through Houston's tremendous organic growth, securitization charges rolling off the bill later next year and our plan to reduce O&M 1% to 2% per year on average. I'd like to reiterate the earlier point that while these incremental investments undoubtedly add to the earnings power of the company. This management team will continue to be conservative as it relates to updates to earnings guidance. We are focused on delivering industry-leading, sustainable earnings growth year-over-year through 2030. As stated, looking beyond 2023, and from the reaffirmed 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.48 to $1.50. We continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS 8% in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually, thereafter through 2030.\nThose are our updates for the quarter. And before turning it back over to Dave, I want to say again how excited I am sitting in my new seat here at CenterPoint. I felt so welcomed by the excellent management team here. I believe that even with some of the headwinds our sector is facing, our tailwinds exceed the headwinds, and we have a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nAs you heard from us today, we now have 13 straight quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations. We are a pure-play regulated premium utility and on a course to continue execution of our current plan with incremental growth opportunities to support our customers beyond that.\n\nJacqueline M. Richert\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Dave. Operator, we'll now turn it back to Q&A."

Earnings Call\n\nCNPNYSEAPR 27, 8:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the CenterPoint Energy's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call with Senior Management. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Jackie Richert, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert.\n\nJackie Richert\n\nDirector, IR, Enterprise Products Partners L.P.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to CenterPoint's Earnings Conference Call. Dave Lesar, our CEO; and Jason Wells, our President and COO, will discuss the company's first quarter 2023 results. Management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon various factors, as noted in our Form 10-Q, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. When providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology, and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to our earnings news release and presentation, both of which can be found on the Investors section on our website. As a reminder, we'll use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dave.\n\nDavid Lesar\n\nGood morning, and thank you to everyone joining us for our First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Although it's been only a few short months since our last call, we continue to see exciting developments here at CenterPoint. First and foremost, the first quarter of 2023 represents yet another quarter of execution. Now our 12th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding expectations. This morning, we announced first quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 per share. In addition, we are also reaffirming our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance target of $1.48 to $1.50 per share, which represents an 8% growth over last year's actual non-GAAP EPS.\nAs a reminder, we grew non-GAAP EPS 9% in both 2021 and 2022. Additionally, we aim to grow at 8% in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually thereafter through 2030. Additionally, we continue to execute on our long-term capital plan for the benefit of both customers and investors. During the quarter, we deployed approximately $1 billion of the $3.6 billion capital we have planned for this year, a great way to start the year. Jason will say more on this a bit later. As we continue on our path of executing for the benefit of both customers and investors, I want to highlight that we are now in the third year of consistently delivering under this management team. This has resulted in an increase in investments to further, the safety, reliability and resiliency of our systems to benefit our customers. It's also provided consistent execution and growth for our investors. We are proud of this effort and look to extending this performance well into the future.\nAlong with another quarter of execution, we announced a new CFO a few weeks ago. A little over 2 years ago, I had the pleasure of announcing Jason Wells at CenterPoint's CFO. Since that time, Jason has not only been a key contributor in developing what we believe is one of the industry's best growth plans, but he's also been a driving force behind its execution.\nNow as Jason continues his management progression in his role as President, I'm excited to introduce Chris Foster as CenterPoint's next Chief Financial Officer. Chris, of course, is well known to most of you. And while we had many quality candidates, we undoubtedly believe we found the right person for this important job. Throughout the search process, Chris continued to impress us with a strong reputation with investors, deep industry knowledge and his passion for delivering for customers. In fact, my discussions with Chris reminded me of the ones I had with Jason during our interview process a couple of years ago. Chris will shortly join the leadership team to help continue the execution of our premium growth plan for years to come. He will also add depth to an already very strong management team. Chris is with us here today and sitting in on this call. So while we can't yet give him a speaking role, he is clearly getting ready to hit the ground running. And I hope you will all join me in welcoming Chris to CenterPoint.\nLastly, I want to touch on a couple of constructive regulatory outcomes we had in our Texas gas and electric jurisdictions. Starting with Texas Gas. During the quarter, we received approximately $1.1 billion of securitization proceeds related to the extraordinary gas costs incurred in Texas during winter storm Uri in 2021. As a reminder, these bonds are issued by the state of Texas and are not on our balance sheet. Although the receipt of these proceeds was delayed longer than we had initially anticipated, we are grateful for the diligent work and careful consideration by all stakeholders to reach this constructive resolution for the benefit of both Texas gas customers and Texas LDC operators. With relation to our Houston Electric business, the PUCT approved our first application for the recovery of the costs incurred in 2021 on our leased emergency temporary mobile generation units during its open meeting on March 9. The PUCT's approval of the use of these units is a great result for our Houston area customers as it highlights the commission's awareness of the important role of this critical tool can play to help mitigate the number and duration of customer outages during extreme weather events. We, at CenterPoint also understand the need for a resilient grid as we hear from stakeholders throughout our Houston Electric service territory about the continued importance of reliable energy. And for very good reason.\nAs economic data from 2022 continues to come in, one thing is clear, Houston's economic engine continues to run at a blistering pace. After recovering some of the economic impact of COVID, the greater Houston area GDP in 2022 was approximately $482 billion or over $1.3 billion per day, up nearly 4% from 2021. The Greater Houston area was also the second fastest-growing Metropolitan area in the U.S. last year. While many may think that Houston's economic growth is primarily driven by the 24 Fortune 500 companies headquartered here, Houston's small business community is also a significant contributor to its nation's leading growth rate. Last month marked the fifth consecutive quarter that Houston topped the Paychex Small Business Employment Watch Index. This consistent job creation and wage growth continues to attract new talent from all over the United States. This only further fuels the strong organic growth in our Houston Electric service territory.\nAccording to U-Haul relocation data, unsurprisingly, last year, Texas was the #1 destination for people moving residences and has been for 5 out of the last 7 years. Outside of Texas, cities in our Indiana Service Territory continued to thrive as well. Lafayette, Indiana, which is in our North Indiana Gas Service Territory topped last year's Wall Street Journal's Emerging Housing Market Index, which identifies top metro areas for homebuyers seeking an appreciating housing market, a strong local economy and appealing lifestyle amenities. The Lafayette area is a manufacturing hub and home to Purdue University. Our portfolio of premium jurisdictions and strong organic growth, O&M discipline and securitization charges rolling off of our Houston Electric customers bills enables us to invest in industry-leading growth for the benefit of our customers while keeping charges at or below the historic level of inflation of 2%. In fact, over the last 10 years, Houston Electric customer charges have increased less than 1% a year on average, well below the rate of inflation during the same period. And although there may be certain periods when the increase in charges outpaces that historical level, we believe our charges will continue to stay in line or below inflation over the long term. Although we feel confident in our plan we've outlined through 2030, we certainly recognize and are dealing with the headwinds our industry has faced over the past several quarters. These include higher interest rates, inflation and specific to this quarter, milder winter weather. However, we believe we have the right team in place to successfully manage through these headwinds that we are currently facing today.\nIn closing, the first quarter of 2023 was a great start to the year as the non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 and that we announced this morning represents over 1/3 of our full year 2023 earnings guidance at the midpoint. We believe this sets us up for a great year as we reaffirm our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.48 to $1.50. With that being said, we remain committed to focusing on execution for 2023 and beyond to the benefit of both our customers and our investors.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jason, who for the last time, has to wear his CFO hat.\n\nJason Wells\n\nSVP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our first quarter call. Before I get into our financial results for the quarter for the final time wearing what Dave refers to as my CFO hat, I want to join him in welcoming Chris Foster as he assumes his new role. As I'm sure many of you know, I've known Chris for a number of years, and I have no doubt that he will be an excellent addition to an already strong management team here at CenterPoint. I look forward to his official start date and partnering with Chris to continue to execute on what we believe is one of the most tangible long-term growth plans in the industry.\nNow turning to the first quarter financial results shown on Slide 5. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.49 for the first quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP EPS excludes small trailing earnings impacts of previous divestitures. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.50 for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of 2022. As Dave mentioned, this accounts for over 1/3 of our full year guidance at the midpoint. Growth in rate recovery contributed $0.09, largely driven by our electric distribution capital tracker filed last year, the DCRF mechanism. In our electric transmission tracker, the TCOS mechanism at Houston Electric. In addition, we continue to see strong organic growth in the Houston area, continuing the long-term trend we've observed over the last 3 decades of 2% average annual growth. Additionally, O&M was $0.02 favorable when compared to the first quarter in 2022 as we continue to find ways to operate more efficiently to meet our goal of reducing O&M 1% to 2% per year on average while remaining focused on meeting our customers' needs.\nLastly, other items such as miscellaneous revenue from nonregulated businesses, tax benefits and other items or another $0.02 favorable when compared in the first quarter of 2023 in the first quarter of 2022. These favorable drivers were partially offset by a $0.06 increase in interest expense due to rising interest rates and higher average floating rate debt balances. However, as I will discuss in a minute, we have reduced our floating rate debt exposure considerably since the end of 2022. In addition, as has been a common trend for our industry during the quarter, weather and usage was $0.04 unfavorable when compared to the same quarter of 2022 and driven by a colder first quarter in 2022 as compared to the more milder winter weather in 2023, primarily in our Texas Gas, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric Service Territories. Looking at heating degree days during the quarter, there were approximately 350 fewer heating degree days below normal in our Texas Gas and Houston Electric service territories. And approximately 550 fewer heating degree days below normal in our Indiana Electric Service Territory when compared to the first quarter of 2022. Fortunately, in our other jurisdictions, they are either fully decoupled or have a comparable weather normalization mechanism that helps mitigate the impact of the milder weather.\nAs Dave mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance range of $1.48 to $1.50 of non-GAAP EPS, which reflects 8% growth over full year 2022 non-GAAP EPS and of $1.38 when using the midpoint. This, of course, comes on the heels of two straight years of 9% growth. Beyond 2023, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS 8% in 2024 and target the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually thereafter through 2030. Our focus continues to be delivering strong industry-leading growth each and every year. Turning to capital investments on Slide 6. To the benefit of our customers during this quarter, we invested $1 billion across our various service territories. This represents over 1/4 of our 2023 annual target of $3.6 billion. We continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of investing $43 billion of capital through 2030 to provide safe, reliable and resilient energy to all customers throughout our service territories. We have previously mentioned that we plan to formally incorporate up to $3 billion of additional identified capital opportunities when we believe we can operationally execute it, efficiently finance it and efficiently recover it. The decision as to when to deploy this capital is still in front of us, and we will include it when we feel it's right. As we've said before, this management team will not commit to something unless we believe we can deliver.\nMoving to a broader regulatory update on Slide 7. Since the start of the year, we've had a number of regulatory filings, primarily in our Texas Gas and Houston Electric jurisdictions. Starting with Texas Gas, we filed our annual grips in which we requested an increased revenue requirement of $60 million. This filing seeks to recover on the capital investments we made in 2022 and which were primarily related to system safety and support our ever-growing service territories in and around Houston. It is anticipated that customer rates will be updated to reflect this investment sometime in June. Additionally, Houston Electric filed capital trackers for both its investments in transmission and distribution made in 2022. The transmission filing often referred to as TCOS, was filed in early March and requested a revenue requirement of approximately $40 million. If approved, it is anticipated this filing will be incorporated into our customer rates in May.\nWith respect to our distribution filing, we filed our annual capital tracker, known as DCRF in the first week of April, requesting a revenue requirement increase of approximately $85 million. And in addition to the DCRF and TCOS, we filed for the remaining recovery of our leased temporary mobile generation units under a temporary emergency electric energy facilities mechanism referred to as TEEEF with a revenue requirement of $188 million. As a reminder, the DCRF and TEEEF are filings that represent nearly $1.4 billion of capital deployed in 2022 in our Houston Electric service territory. They will not go into rates until September 1, which skews incremental earnings towards the latter part of the year. We continue to invest for the benefit of our customers while remaining cognizant of bill impacts. We've been able to invest over the last 10 years, while keeping customer charge increases below the average rate of inflation during that time. In fact, since 2014, a Houston Electric charges have increased less than 1% annually on average, and we anticipate being able to execute our long-term capital plan with customer charges increasing at or below the historic level of inflation. Again, we'll be able to achieve this through leveraging the continued organic growth of Houston, O&M discipline and securitization charges rolling off our customers' bills.\nDuring the quarter, the PUCT approved our first application for a recovery related to our temporary emergency mobile generation units, as Dave mentioned earlier. I want to echo his sentiment regarding what we think is an overwhelmingly positive outcome for our customers. Using the last couple of years, as an example, the Houston area is subject to extreme weather events that can adversely impact service to our customers. The commissioner's decision not only reflects their deep understanding of the need for increased power resiliency during these extreme weather events, but also their pragmatic approach to allowing utilities to use available tools designed to help mitigate its impacts on energy service for those living in the Houston area.\nLastly, I'd like to cover some credit-related topics. As of the end of the first quarter, aligning with Moody's methodology, our FFO to debt as reported, was over 14%, we continue to trend well in this area and fully expect to be in our annual target range of 14% to 15% throughout 2023. We ended the first quarter at 16% floating rate debt outstanding down $1.9 billion from the end of 2022. A few actions have led to this significant reduction. First, as Dave mentioned, during the quarter, we received securitization proceeds related to Winter Storm Uri, which we used to pay down some of the floating rate notes. We have now collected approximately 90% of the $2.1 billion of extraordinary gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri with approximately $230 million left to be collected in our Minnesota gas business. Second, we issued nearly $2.3 billion of fixed rate debt at our operating company level in the first quarter, including our first ever green bond issuance at Houston Electric. Some of these issuances were used to refinance a certain amount of outstanding floating rate debt from year that was undertaken for incremental investments that were made in the fourth quarter of 2022. We were able to successfully issue this debt despite the disruption in the banking sector. We believe this reflects our investors' confidence in the strength of our balance sheet, long-term growth and this management team's ability to execute.\nAs I touched on last quarter, we exited 2022 with an elevated amount of floating rate debt, some of which was driven by the cold December weather during which we purchased more gas at higher prices than we had forecasted. With that being said, this balance has been reduced as we collect from customers, albeit somewhat slower due to the milder winter. We anticipate collecting the majority of these gas costs by the end of the second quarter, and we will continue to pay down floating rate debt as we recover these costs.\nThese are my updates for the quarter. As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid Lesar\n\nThank you, Jason. As you've heard from us today, we now have 12 straight quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations. We are a pure-play regulated premium utility and on a course to continue to deliver on incremental long-term growth opportunities to support our customers."

    "content": "Full Year 2022 CNP Assurances SA Earnings Call\n\nFull Year 2022 CNP Assurances SA Earnings Call\n\nCNPPARISFEB 16, 5:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome, and thank you for joining the CNP Assurances 2022 Annual Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Stephane Dedeyan, Group CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephane Dedeyan\n\nCEO, CNP Assurances SA\n\nThank you very much. Hello, everybody. We are very happy with Thomas Behar and all the team to present our results. I will, of course, elaborate on our strategy, on our results and on our outlook. But not only about our financial results because we assume today to put at the same level, extra financial KPIs linked to our corporate mission and classical financial KPI and we are going to explain you why.\nSo let's start with our strategy and the necessity to speak about overall performance to measure the whole impact of this strategy. As you know, our strategy is a development strategy based on 3 pillars: the first one is to reinforce our fundamentals to be even more stronger by adapting the individual savings expansion model in response to changes in the interest rate environment and sustainability issues. We all know that there has been a change in the macro parading during the year. So it's very important to adapt our savings business model.\nSecond, by maintaining our position in the term creditor insurance, we have a very strong position. We act as a leader in France and also in Europe. So it's very -- it's a very important issue to reinforce this position and to be even stronger. Second pillar, develop growth and diversification levers. This is at the core of our development strategy. In France, we want to leverage our partnership with La Banque Postale and we are going to elaborate on it.\nAnd also, we think we have room for development in the field of social protection and premium offerings. I mean in the high-net-worth individual market, we are very performing, and we think we have also room for development in this area. At an international level, as you know, we have made a lot of structuring operations during the year. And we think that we can activate additional growth drivers in Europe and also in Latin America.\nAnd the third pillar is to transform our model for a sustainable development. As you know, we have a B2B2C model, which embodies 2 risks. The first one is to be become invisible on the highs of the customer because we are a little bit far from him. And second, to be considered as a community by our partners. So it's very important to transform our model and to be able to develop a high-value model. And for that and to develop in this type of model, we think that it's very important to be different, to be unique. And our way to win the preference of our partners of the -- and of our customers is to embody our corporate mission and we're going to elaborate later on that.\nSecond point is once you win the preference, you have to maintain this preference. And for this we think that it's essential for us to play an essential role in the pattern of value chain and therefore, to develop a model which brings high value to our partners.\nSo this is the 3 pillars of our strategy. And what we want to emphasize this morning is that we think that we are working the talk of our strategy. On the first pillar, we have the unit-linked as a percent of total new money is up 2.2 percentage points to 31.5%. We have made a huge work in optimizing our strategic asset allocation with a very significant increase in the average yield to maturity at purchase.\nWe were at 0.8% last year, and we are now at 2.2%. And to obtain this performance, we have invested more than EUR 30 billion, which is a huge amount and that was necessary to be at this level of amount to make sure that we transform really the asset allocation and that we bring value in the average yield to maturity at purchase.\nConcerning the term creditor insurance, as you know, to strengthen our position, we have made a price freeze and removal of surcharge for aggravated health risk, which means that we increase the competitivity of our products. And we have good results on that because we are still growing in a market which is even more competitive.\nLast point, as you know, we have put all our pension business in a dedicated vehicle, which provides a regulatory framework, which is tailored to the type of liability we have in this business, and it will allow us to have more flexibility in the asset allocation and investments. And that will be very fruitful for our customers in terms of profitability of their investment. And also for us, in terms of capacity to adapt the asset allocation to the type of liabilities we have on the balance sheet on that type of business.\nThe second pillar, we are also working the talk here. As you know, we have made very strategic and significant operations at the international level in Brazil and also in Italy. When you're a French company and you want to develop at an international level, the best way to do is to replicate at the international level, something you know very well on your domestic market. And what we know very well on our domestic market is to combine 2 legs in our development strategy.\nFirst leg is strategic partnership, which give you a critical size, visibility, credibility. We can speak about La Banque Postale, we can speak about BPCE in the French market. And also to combine the strategic partnerships with what we call open sea model, open model, where we have more granularity and a more diversified type of partnership. And of course, we are we are more competitive on the open sea model when you have critical size through your strategic partnership.\nAnd of course, we are even better in our strategic partnership because we know all the innovation of the market with our more diversified partnership in the open model. So those 2 legs are really synergetic and what we have set very strategically in the year 2022 is to put the 2 legs model in Italy and in Brazil. And that will -- we think we have set the basis for a sustainable growth on those markets with this very, very strategic movement.\nIn France, we want to go even deeper in the partnership with La Banque Postale, and we have some application points here. First is the new life insurance contract, the mass market contract because we bring in this mass market contract some financial engineering, which is only available for high-net-worth individuals on the French market. I'm speaking about the manager guided management option and this financial engineering will be available for the mass market, and we have very, very strong growth on this project at the beginning of the year.\nSo we think it's really a winning move. Second, we are deploying the caution guarantee, which we combine with the term creditor insurance with La Banque Postale and this also brings value to the customer and also economic value for the company. And in the premium savings segment, we have results above our target, and we think we have a very, very interesting value proposition on the French market. and we will continue to grow in this segment.\nThird pillar, the transformation of our model for sustainable development. First, we have started to embody our corporate mission. It's an in-depth transformation of our way to do business. I will elaborate on that a little bit later. But for the first time today, we published our nonfinancial commitments and corresponding indicators, stakeholder -- by stakeholders, we think is quite new and quite bold, if I may say.\nSecond, the development of a high value-added model. The key word here is empowering people to give them the ability to take decisions in front of the customer, in front of the partners and then to have the agility, the flexibility, the time to market in order to be innovative and to be able to respond to unsatisfied needs, which is our definition of innovation. But it's also a question of having an agile IT system and an agile IT architecture.\nJust one figure here. We -- today, we have 47 different IT systems. And we have a massive investment program to go to 3 systems only and to make a lot of appreciation of our systems to have the flexibility, the agility to have a technological lever at our disposal to sustain our innovation policy and strategy.\nSo I think with this cherry picked examples, I really think we are working the talk of our strategy. But the question now is, what does this strategy produced as a result in 2022? And today, and that's really new, we are measuring and reporting to you what we call our overall performance. That means a 360-degree performance disclosures that embody the corporate mission and inform on our 6 stakeholder groups: customers, partners, employees, planet, society and our shareholders and investors.\nIn practice, we include in our results at the same level, extra financial KPIs and financial KPIs because we are convinced that financial and nonfinancial performance form a virtuous cycle, which produce more performance for a longer time.\nSo let's go to the heart of it. First, on the key financial indicators slide. Keywords here is very, very robust results; and second, recognize strength. In terms of results, I think we can speak about growth and profitability with the highest premium income ever recorded by CNP Insurance, up 14%. And also the highest attributable net profit ever, up 25%. We are very proud of those results, and we think that's really, really a very good performance.\nAnd these results are not at the expense of our financial strength because as you can see, our consolidated SCR ratio is 230%, up 13 points. Our notation by the notation agency, is still very high. Our policyholders surplus reserve is still very high also at EUR 14.1 billion. And we have been able to have plus 66 percentage basis points growth in average policyholder yield to 1.57%. I think those results show the strength and the resilience of our historical model, but also our capacity to successfully integrate the CVA activities we've bought to Aviva in Italy.\nLet's move now to our key nonfinancial indicators. They show a decisive action in favor of the environment and also in favor of all our other stakeholders. Let's start with the planet on the left. Our carbon footprint of the investment portfolio is decreasing very significantly. And that's very important for us to have this decrease year after year in order to make sure that we fully act in accordance with the Paris Agreement and to bring our tribute to the global -- against the global warming.\nSecond, the amount of green investments in our balance sheet. As you can see, we've reached EUR 25.2 billion which is, I think, very significant amount that is invested in companies that accelerate the energetical transition. What is also important is to protect the biodiversity. As perhaps you don't know, we have -- we are one of the major honor of forestry in France and in the world. And with our forest, we are able to compensate 10% of our annual overall CO2 emission, which means that this is a very significant asset we have to bring our tribute to the -- respect of the Paris Agreement.\nSo what we want to do here is not only being able to absorb a part 10% of our CO2 emission, but also measure the biodiversity in our forest because once we've measured the biodiversity and we have clarified the biodiversity, we are able to protect it.\nSo the first step here is to measure for 100% of our forest, the biodiversity, at the moment, we are 42%. If we look now at the customer, as a stakeholder, we have a low customer effort score at 2.2 on a scale which is up to 5. The lower it is, the less effort the customer has to do. So we think that's a good starting point. But of course, we want to improve. We measure also the net promoter score awarded by our distribution partners at the moment plus 12, which is quite a good starting point because it's very important that it's positive.\nAnd of course, we want also to improve. I think in terms of percentage of women on executive committees with our 51% we are at the target. So we will maintain this proportion. For the society, something which is very important, is the purchase as a percent of the total purchase we have in inclusive manner, which means the part of our purchase we do with SMEs, micro enterprises and social economy, it's already 28%. That is -- I think this is already a good achievement, but we want to improve also on this point.\nAnd as the investors, as a stakeholder, we want to -- we are already very well rated by the ESG in terms of ESG ratings, and we are among the top 9% and we want to keep this type of position. Of course, everyone is improving. So keeping this very high position is a challenge per se.\nLet's get into more details about the way we organize and the way we organize the extra financial performance management. A few words about our overall approach before leaving the floor to Thomas. What we want is to develop our unique qualities to gain the preference and be able to develop our business. So for this, we think the best thing to do is to embody our corporate mission. You have our corporate mission on the slide. You can read it.\nBut I would like to tell you what it means for us. It means that we want to use our financial power and our expertise to, first, protect the greatest number of people; and second, fight global warming. And we want to do this as an insurer and also as an investor, and this is our way to contribute to an inclusive and sustainable society.\nIn practical terms, we have chosen one strong commitment to each of our 6 stakeholder groups and in front of each commitment, we have set goals. And in front of each of those goals, we have 16 key performance indicators, and I will let -- I will leave the floor to Thomas to enter into more details about those KPIs and commitment.\n\nThomas Behar\n\nDeputy CEO & Head of Financial Information, CNP Assurances SA\n\nOkay. So it's my pleasure for the first time to deliver to you what are our precise KPIs towards our key stakeholders, beginning by the customers that we are in our first as -- the first one as stakeholders. So each of the pages are presented the same way. So you will see at the top of the slide, what is the goal that we want to reach, which is more important.\nAfter you have the KPIs and it has been done, as Stephane said, through the teams to think about what is the best KPIs that represents the goals that we want to reach. And at the bottom, you have our outlook for 2023, meaning what are the actions that we want to do in 2023 to progress in this KPIs. You will have in the KPIs every time where we are today coming from -- already coming with a progression from the past '21, 2020, '19, it depends where we begin to measure. And every time you have our target 2025.\nSo let's begin with the first one, which is to support the customer at all times. So the KPIs we have chosen to -- as an illustration about making protection solutions available to everyone regardless of their situation and be there for our insurers when they need us. So the first that we wanted to have is something that we are systematically serving our customers when we finished work with him when he stopped having the benefit of our help on claims on adapting something in this contract.\nWe asked if it was easy or not easy to be with us. If it's very easy number -- score 1, if it's very difficult, score 5, it's the customer effort score. We have an average of 2.2 in 2022, 2.2 out of 5. We were last year at 2.6 and our aim is to be below 2.0. What are we going to do to improve these KPIs quite easily? We are working hard to have long ways in the contract that customers can more easily understand whoever is the customer. So using plain language dealing with them in the contracts.\nIt's also to improve the self-care to have more automated as possible way of interacting with them. And when it fails, when the situation needs commitment of a participation of the undertaking to be present. And the grade and phases, the increase in phases that we want to do is to more active and proactive contacts to solve the issue when there is not -- there isn't a situation.\nSo that's the first one, the first KPI. The second one is to ensure as many people as possible regardless of their situation. So here, it's measured in a number of contracts, but below the number of contracts, you may have million of insurances. It's mostly in France and in Brazil that we have the sixth contract. And we have million of insured in Brazil in micro insurance to protect themselves with very, very low wages for them. So that's 6 products that we have to help this very vulnerable population to get access to insurance. And we will continue with associations to answer the needs of this population as part of our resonate.\nSecond one, if we want to be good with customers, we have to be good with partners. We have 1 KPI in order to develop effective and innovative solutions with them to drive progress in protection insurance. We have chosen to measure their satisfaction. So it's NPS, net promoter score. I don't know if you know this kind of indicator. So the same way we're asking questions to customers, we asking question to partners.\nThe question is between 1 and 10. Do you recommend what we are doing with you? And so they have the answer between 1 and 10. 10 meaning, yes, I love you. And so we keep the score 9 and 10, and the score 1 to 6. We eliminate 7 and 8, and we simply do the deduction between people who are very happy, 9 and 10 and people who are not happy between 1 and 6. And so you can have a score between minus 100 and plus 100. Our score today is 12, and we want to reach it over 20. And for that, we have to work to improve with our partners, the tools that the financial advisers are using to have the most seamless processes and to develop with them, the products that answers day after day, the needs of their clients.\nThe next one is employees. When you want to be good with customers and you have been good with partners, you need to be good with the employees of the group and to support their development with an organization that boasts the wealth of talent and diversity, which is us. We ask questions the same way to our teams about engagement and well-being. The score is today 73 out of 100, and we want to be over 75%. That's the first KPI.\nThe second set of KPIs concerns the percentage of women, the gender parity. You can see that we are very good as the Chief Committee. And we want to say on this level, and we have progress to do about the percentage of women senior management position. So we have to work on potentials, the future senior management to encourage women and to work to have a possibility to have them in the senior management.\nAnd also when we are hiring new people also to have this faster look for women parity. Last, is the number of work study contracts or internships that are offered to young people from the priced neighborhoods. We have 59 from CNP Insurance and subsidiaries from all the group, and we want to be over 200. After employees, partners and clients, you have the society.\nThe first one is what we are buying as purchases. So we are 28% of purchases that are inclusive, meaning with small entities and social and solidarity economic areas where we are buying that, and we want to be over 30% with very focused on social economies. So that's part of our responsibility to the society.\nSecond part is to assist and support projects with a social impact to promote better living in the society. The tool of this KPI being illustration of the way we want to help a bit more inclusive sustainable society with a place for everyone. So it's what we call in a French way of speaking Messina, so sponsorship projects and actions with a social impact is EUR 2.9 million, and we want to be among all the sponsorship projects for those with social impact, we want to be over EUR 3.5 million.\nAnd last, the percentage of employees were mobilized during their work time to participate in projects with a social impact. We want to be over 20% coming from 11%. And last, the planet where you can see we have the user numbers. We have EUR 25 billion invested in green investment portfolio, meaning green bonds, green forest with the goods and white sustainable level buildings with the right level. The funds were covered under #9 of FSP or infrastructure.\nWe have, in fact, 3 years of advance in this number, EUR 25.2 billion. We were last year at EUR 21.1 billion, where we want to be over EUR 30 billion although there are not so many or so much projects that are existing, and we are working to wish this goal. You can remember that we have issued EUR 500 million of subordinated debt this year, not only green, but addressing all the sustainable questions.\nThe second part is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, measures by the carbon footprint. It's -- I don't see the number in the slide, but the number is 55 for 2022, we were 107 1 year before. So trying to reduce the carbon footprint, you all know what actions that we are dealing with oil emissions. So a lot of forbidden investments that we have now in our book. The target was 80. So as we have reached already this target, we will adopt a new one. The target that we have in 2024 was according the net alliance. And we are now building a new trajectory that has to be validated by the SBTi. And as soon as it will be done, we will have the pleasure to communicate to you our new targets according to this new methodology is a validation of SBTi as we have already reached our goal of reduction of carbon footprint.\nSo that's for our portfolio of investments. The second is about our internal operations. We were around 3,492 last year. We are now at 2,280. It comes mainly with our new building. So I'm very posed to do this presentation with Stephane in our very new building. We have all the green criteria for that. And I hope that you will be able to join one day us in this building.\nThe target for that is 1,736 in 2030. We have work to do to our other biddings and especially in (inaudible), where we have our second greatest building in France. Last, protection of biodiversity. So we measure the biodiversity. So we are the first private owners of forest in France. We measured 18% of the biodiversity of the forest. We are now covering 42% of the surface, and we want to reach 100% in 2025. So you can ask measuring is it enough to protect biodiversity, of course, not. But with the measure, we can adopt the right solution to protect these different spaces, also forest. And for that, you have to know what are the different spaces in the forest that we hold, and we are adopting the right measure year after year in the forest where we have measured the biodiversity.\nLast, it's according to shareholders and investors. So we want to generate sustainable financial performances. And as a symbol, you have seen that for this presentation, we put in first place extra financial measurements before financial measurements, meaning that for us, there is no financial patient value without an extra financial question of value that could be sustainable. So we want to improve our nonfinancial performance. So we are referring to ESG ratings. So we have a panel of 5. For some of them, we have the best notes, best rating of the insurance sector for others which we are in the 9% of the best ratings that they are delivering. Our aim is to stay the best in class, so between 5% and 10% as a target that we have for 2025.\nLast, we want to do more in support of a sustainable economy as a major player in responsible investment. It's very limited definition, which is an impact investment portfolio with specific aims that has to be defined in advance of the investments in the target. So we have EUR 1 billion as a target for 2025. 2.5 today with criteria's that we -- where we want to improve sustainable goals for this investment. That's for the KPI.\nOn next page, you have the wrap up. You can see in this page, the different indicators, what were our beginning point where we began to measure 2019, 2021, 2022, and where we want to go. This list is the list of today, year after year with the teams, the teams will propose new KPIs, so you will see image new KPIs in addition to this 16.\nSometimes one of them will be reached, and if there will be no any more progress and plus 1 day, 1 of them will disappear. But we will give you the information regularly where we are on our corporate mission indicators. Next page, you have a reminder about the ratings that we have. The one with new is the last one, CDP with A- amongst the 21% of financial sector companies with an A score for leadership.\nLet's go now after this extra financial performance to the second component of the global performance of the group, which is the financial performance. What you can see with the premium income, the EBIT, the attributable net profit is that we have another system, an undertaking was adopted to the increase of interest rates that has been able to live during this year with all the difficulties that you know, especially in Europe with a very, very good performance, meaning that we are very solid resilient, but also making progress in all our compartments of the net profit.\nWe have today, as an historic point last year of IFRS 4 with the highest premium income for CNP, the highest EBIT for CNP, the highest attributable net profit for CNP. EUR 36 billion for the sales, up 13.7% from last year. And where does it come? Because you can see that like-for-like, we have done 3.3%. It comes from the acquisition of (inaudible) from Aviva last year in Italy. So we have performed very well this integration. And as the first year, we have an addition of EUR 4.4 billion of sales in Italy. We are still the leaders of PACTE transfer. So we are committing to propose to our insured the capacity to leave their old contract to go for a new contract with a specific advice that is given by our banking networks to look again about the situation and confirm and adapt to their new risk profile becoming older with more revenues.\nAnd usually, we have an improvement of 5 -- 15 points of the percentage of unit-linked in their contracts. EBIT. We have an increase of 6% like-for-like coming from last year. So it's EUR 3.5 -- EUR 3.570 billion, and we will see a little bit later where it comes from. And the net profit 25 percentage of increase from last year. So we were at EUR 1.5 billion. It's EUR 1.939 billion. I can't resist to say the full number is very important.\nIt will enable us to give a good dividend to our shareholders, La Banque Postale EUR 945 million with a payout ratio of 50%. Our solvency capital ratio is very good at 230% points. It has increased from last year, which is the symbol of the capacity of all we have done to be ready for the increase of the interest rate. And perhaps as the difference from other competitors, we have this increase as we were ready for that.\nThe cost-to-income ratio continued to progress at 27%. It's not a progression. It's the progression being efficient. But with -- in our mind, the fact that we continue to progress what we can deliver to the insured and with the partners.\nLet's go now for the sales. So you have this picture, which represents where we are today in CNP Assurance with the capacity of the diversification.\nSo if you look at that, you can see that we are no more 100% French. We are 2 block, France, 53%; international, 47%. And you can see that we are diversified. We have very big partners but it's diversified between them, La Banque Postale, 22%; BPCE, 16%; Brazil, 20%; Italy, 21%; rest of Europe, 5%; (inaudible), 6.5%. So you have a diversity of the sales, which enables to stabilize when something goes down, the others can go up.\nSo it's the way the diversification works. And today, we have also this in the graphics. You can see in the place where we are now able with 100% acquisition to be ready to develop open model, which is CNP comes from [CMB] in the Brazil and from Italy with CVA.\nLet's go to the performance of International activities. So we have an increase of 43.5% of the premium income coming from CVA, as I said, minus 5% like-for-like. The year was divided in fact, in 2 parts. First part, a very good increase of the sales. And second part, in Italy, in Brazil, you have a reduction of the sales of 30%. In Italy, there is a competition with financial products. And in Brazil, we have partners that prefer at the end of the year due to the increase of interest rates to sale more banking balance sheet products. The EBIT nevertheless, an increase of 41.5%. You can see like-for-like, the increase, Europe is 17.5%.\nLatin America is 9.6%. So it's a very important increase as the total is 11.6%. You have in Latin America, an addition year-after-year of pension -- the pension activities that makes the stock going up and up, which is the source of the revenue. And in Europe, every undertaking has contributed to the increase of the EBIT. So we have a very good progress everywhere and if you have a question, we'll be able to give a little bit explanation for that.\nFor France, we have higher earnings and ongoing shift towards uniting products. So we have not changed from last year. We have still a reduction of the sales for the euro compartment part, traditional saving and patients, you can see that the primary income and with the net new [money] and you have an increase of the unit-linked saving patients for payment income and the net (inaudible) positive.\nSo it was what we did in the past, and it has continued in 2022. On the same way, you have an increase of the EBIT of 4.2%, which reflects, of course, the effect of the higher interest rate. We have released some provisions, some results. And also, we have controlled the increase of the administrative cost, 5.4%. But -- and at the same time, we have combined the collaborators with the increase of the wages in this new context.\nLet's go now for the investment. So the year has changed on the next slide. So we have changed, of course, the asset allocation because interest rate has changed. So we are now at 91% bonds. We are investing less on equities. So we have still a good proportion of property and infrastructure with 4%. But what has really changed is, of course, the average reinvestment rate of the bond portfolio, 0.8% to 2.2%, which is a real change as we love this 2.2% opposition with 0.8%.\nWe have done at the end of the year, a great rotation of our old bonds to go for new obligation. And so we sold 16 billion of bonds to replace them at a higher interest rate with our (inaudible) a very -- an impact on the net profit -- on the level of the net profit, because we assume that with the net profit that you have seen just before.\nSo that was in the second part of the year. In the first part of the year, as you know us now, we have done our program of realization of gains on equities at the beginning of the year before the drop, which is -- which has contributed to the net profit of the group.\nLet's go now to insure. We were committed to (inaudible) our insurers in the increase of the revenues. In France, we came from 0.91% to -- and we reached 1.57%. So it's a very huge increase of [66] basis points. And if we look to what is our underwriting policies, it's to sell if there is a good risk appetite from the customers of 30% unit-linked in minimum share in the contract.\nFor them, we had in last year, a 1.32% remuneration rate for remuneration of the contract. We increased (inaudible) [166] basis points these numbers. And now these contracts have a medium remuneration of 2.38%. So we are one of the first in the market for this remuneration, much more than other competitors -- traditional competitors or bank insurers competitors. So with us, we have a 30% unit-linked minimum, you can find very good interest rate remuneration, and it will not stop.\nWe have very good promotional at this moment with (inaudible) rate promotional, which come to addition to these numbers. Then the cost-to-income ratio, you can see with the curve, I don't think it's useful to comment. This curve speaks on -- by themselves with continuously progression that we are doing on our efficiency.\nLast, we have this profit, up 25%. As the total, we -- for the first time for many years, we have reduced the policy surplus reserve as a total of EUR 500 billion to EUR 600 billion of (inaudible). So we are still EUR [14.1] billion. So we are ready to continue to (inaudible) our insure in the increase of interest rate, but it's still 6.5% of the technical result. So we have a great place for future (inaudible) to stay right in the competition. That's why what I wanted to comment in this slide.\n(inaudible) So you can see that we have been able to deliver value with EUR 2 billion operating free cash flow. Solvency. So we are strong with the 230%, ready to do new acquisition with this number, we continue to develop acquisition or new partnerships. You can see that what explains mainly this number is market changes. So 80% with the increase in interest rates, we were ready for that, and we have increased the coverage ratio.\nYou can see with the [sensibilities] that now if the interest rates were continuing to increase, we will lose points from the 70 capital ratio. You have the different components, reduction of the surplus reserve. The net profit, the reduction of (inaudible) forward rates and suite debt that are represented on this slide.\nNext slide are for investors, that investors, especially for you, so you can see the leverage ratio 30.8x. On the next slide, you have our capacity of (inaudible), which is, as usual, presented in this slide. Next slide is the coverage of the interest or the EBIT that you can see, 13.7 for EBIT interest and 2.8% for the average interest rate that we have today in debt. Our last in line with our free rating agencies, you can see the good not the good rating that we have with them. I will not comment further.\nAnd last, the dividend, EUR 1.38 per share. We are at 50% of (inaudible) pressure to remind -- remember our policy deliver -- dividend, which is between 40% of sales ratio and 50% of sales ratio due to the very good numbers that we have. Net profit due to the fact that we have a very good solvency capital ratio. So we were able to be at the highest level possible with our policy dividend ratio with 50% in this EUR 1.38 per share. So that's for the net profit. That's for the explanation of the financial performance.\nYou should really now see both of them, extra financial and financial. Extra Financial is a lot of strong commitment as we have been to present to you that we will follow. And the financial performance which is the best performance that we have ever done for our numbers. So that's for the performance, Stephane, that we did in detail for this year.\n\nStephane Dedeyan\n\nCEO, CNP Assurances SA\n\nThank you very much, Thomas. And before leaving you the floor for questions and answers. Perhaps a few words about our outlook. So of course, we want to develop. So growth is a very important word in this outlook in France where we want to become a full-service insurers, life and non-life. But also, we think we have room for development in personal risk and pension businesses and also building the independent financial adviser channel for our premium savings products. On the international field, we want to want to capitalize on the strategic moves, which were done in Europe and Latin America, structuring our open model leg. So we want to capitalize on that and to be able to provide additional growth. Of course, we are not at the end of the adaptation of our business model in savings and pensions to the new macroeconomic paradigm with this increase in interest rates.\nSo we think we have also some optimizations about the balance sheet management. Our covers and also embody all the sustainability issues in the savings and pension offer. And last but not least, continue to walk the talk about our corporate mission and reinforce of all action plans to enable us to meet our 2025 extra financial targets and also something which will be a lot of work, work with the SBTi to define a decarbonization trajectory and to validate SBTi, it is very important for us because it's a matter of credibility of what we do.\nSo thank you very much for your attention. We are, of course, with all the team here available for your questions. Just a last word. This is not a communication exercise that we do today about our extra financial KPIs. This is something which is a very strong conviction for us. There is no economic profit -- a sustainable economic profit without a strong commitment in the extra financial field. And for us, this is really at the core of our strategy. Because if we want to develop, we have to gain the preference of the customers and the partners in a B2B2C model. So it's really important for the business to work the talk of our corporate mission.\nAnd also it's highly motivating for people, because the way we have done it is not to set targets from the top. We ask all the teams of CNP Assurances to think about the way it changes, the way we do business, the way we exercise our expertise and they set themselves the goals that we disclosed to you today. So let's see a strong commitment of all the employees of CNP Assurances and something, which I think is quite new and quite a [vanguard] in the way to do insurance business, which is our passion and we think that's really a useful business. So we want to be useful to all our stakeholders. Thank you very much for your attention. And now, of course, we are available for all your questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Jackie Richert, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Ms. Richert?\n\nJackie Richert\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to CenterPoint's earnings conference call. Dave Lesar, our CEO; and Jason Wells, our CFO, will discuss the company's third quarter 2022 results. Management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon various factors as noted in our Form 10-Q, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call.\nWhen providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share. On a consolidated basis, referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to the earnings news release and presentation, both of which can be found under the Investors Section on our website. As a reminder, we use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jackie. Good morning and thank you to everyone joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we get started today, I want to congratulate Jason Wells on this morning's announcement of his pending promotion to President and COO of CenterPoint Energy. Since joining our team a little over 2 years ago, he has demonstrated that he has the strategic vision, executive mindset, deep industry experience and operational knowledge to be a great leader. Equally important, he has the confidence and support of our organization, our Board and our shareholders. This promotion is a product of an ongoing and thoughtful succession planning process and executive development journey that has been a top priority of mine and our entire Board. The Board and I have watched Jason grow as an executive over the last 2 years and believe now is the perfect time to expand his role within our organization.\nAnd for those of you who are wondering, I am not going anywhere. I look forward to continuing to mentor and support Jason in his new role and to working side by side to execute on our strategy. I know I speak for many of you when I say, well done, Jason. As you have seen from the press releases we issued this morning, this has been a very busy quarter at CenterPoint, and today's call may seem a bit like a mini Analyst Day update. When I became a CEO of CenterPoint nearly 2.5 years ago, the company needed to quickly establish a strategic path forward to, among other things, realign our relationships with our regulators, customers and investors. We look to immediately set challenging but executable goals by which you could measure progress while collectively adopting a management mindset of over delivering on our commitments. I want to highlight what that has looked like here at CenterPoint over the last 2.5 years.\nSo what we've achieved so far. First, we committed to achieving industry-leading non-GAAP EPS growth. Now including this quarter, we have met or exceeded that goal for 10 consecutive quarters. In addition, we have over delivered on that growth by raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance 5x during that 2.5 years span and continue to reiterate that we will grow future earnings off of each new and higher base that we achieve. Second, we committed to becoming a pure-play regulated utility that was not subjected to the earnings volatility of our now divested midstream investment. And now more than 95% of our earnings are derived from regulated utility operations.\nThe approximately $1.3 billion of after-tax midstream sale proceeds exceeded your expectations and allowed us to reinvest the money into our regulated utility businesses for the benefit of our customers. Finally, we committed to funding our increased regulated utility investments without reliance on external equity issuances. This led to the sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma LDCs for which we obtained a landmark valuation and then recycle those cash proceeds efficiently back into our regulated businesses, all for the benefit of our customers and investors.\nNow let's look at today. We earned $0.32 in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We are also reiterating full year 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.37 to $1.39 per share, which represents a 9% growth rate at the midpoint versus the comparable 2021 non-GAAP Utility EPS of $1.27. And as Jason will discuss, we are also ahead of plan in terms of capital spend for 2022 in spite of supply chain pressures, and we've deployed more capital than anticipated.\nIn addition, today, we are initiating our full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance target range of $1.48 to $1.50. At the midpoint, this represents an additional 8% growth over our previously raised 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Beyond 2023, we continue to expect 8% non-GAAP EPS growth for 2024 and at the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually thereafter through 2030. I also want to point out that these earnings growth rate targets do not reflect any potential earnings from the $5.3 billion in incremental capital opportunities that we will discuss next.\nOur track record of over-delivering continues with today's announcement of what is now a third increase to our 2021 Analyst Day, $40 billion 10-year capital plan. We continue to anchor around this Analyst Day number to provide consistency, clarity and clearly mark goalpost for our investors to follow. Our new incremental capital opportunities are based on customer-driven investments that were developed through our increased stakeholder engagement strategy. Our strategy initially kicked off with the City of Houston on our collective Resilient Now initiative under the leadership of Mayor Sylvester Turner. It has grown to include over 30 cities in some of our largest industrial customers.\nWith their collective input, we have developed $5.3 billion in additional capital opportunities related to increased systems resiliency, reliability and grid modernization as well as to facilitate eventual EV adoption.\nNow there is a well-known saying that demographics is destiny. And in looking at its demographics, the City of Houston is destined for great things. As the only investor-owned utility headquartered in Texas, we are fortunate to serve customers in the City of Houston and its surrounding areas. The Houston area is one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse areas in the nation, averaging more than 2% annual population growth over the last 3 decades. We believe that this diversity only strengthens Houston's future growth prospect, which benefits our customers and investors alike. Although Houston today is well known as the energy capital of the world, not as well known is that it's also home to one of the largest active ports in the nation in the Houston-based Texas Medical Center, which is the largest medical center in the world. For example, the Port of Houston is the largest port in the U.S. by waterborne tonnage and is also the U.S.'s largest exporter with over $140 billion of goods shipped annually. This is more than 35% greater than that of New York, the next largest U.S. shipping exporter.\nThe Houston Ship Channel's Petrochem complex alone, both 272 chemical plants, refineries, and other industrial facilities, which generate about $800 billion a year in business annually. Just this summer, an additional $1 billion project which started to widen and deepen the channel to support immense future growth. In addition, the Port Authority is now looking at electrifying its port operation. This will also benefit our customers and communities who live near the port by helping reduce submissions from idling cargo ships.\nTurning to the Texas Medical Center, or TMC. If this complex was standing on its own, would already be the 8th largest business district in the United States. And just last month, it was announced that the TMC would nearly double its size in the next 5 to 10 years. It is now anticipated that this doubling in size of the TMC will alone create over 100,000 new jobs. With a greater focus on the biosciences and biomanufacturing of critical medical products, the TMC should continue to attract diverse talent for years to come. Today, it already sees roughly 8 million patients every year. So much like the region, it continues to grow.\nLastly, and perhaps the purest illustration of Houston's incredible organic growth, there are over 70,000 births in the Houston area alone last year. That's a new baby born every 7 minutes. While Houston's natural growth and positioning in the Gulf Coast provides a clear competitive advantage, we are also mindful of our exposure to severe weather. Our Houston Electric customers know what's at stake, a day without power can equal a loss of up to $1.4 billion of GDP. This is one factor that drives the collective community desire for a more reliable and resilient energy supply. This desire has led to customer-driven investment opportunities that we will be folding into our 10-year capital plan through 2030.\nFor reasons to be discussed next, at this time, we are now only incorporating $2.3 billion of this additional $5.3 billion in capital into the balance of our existing 10-year investment plan through 2030. $1 billion of this is expected to be deployed by the end of 2025 and another $1.3 billion to be deployed by the end of 2030, all for the benefit of our customers. And while we are not updating our Analyst Day non-GAAP EPS guidance targets previously discussed, the deployment of this increased capital will clearly increase the potential future earnings power of the company.\nThe initial $2.3 billion in capital now being added to our investment plan reflects the subset of opportunities, we believe we can currently and confidently execute efficiently and is comprised of the following: $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of this new capital will be dedicated toward our distribution system resiliency, reliability and expanded grid modernization. This also includes strategically undergrounding certain parts of our system, replacing poles with higher wind resistant ones and elevating parts of the grid, especially substations to help protect such structures from the threat of flood damage.\nWe recognize our customers want more resiliency more quickly, which is why we have already jumped ahead and began some of these projects in 2022. For example, $300 million of the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion related to this category of capital spend is expected to be completed by the end of this year. $600 million to $800 million of this new capital will be focused on transmission upgrades. As we've stated before, our Houston Electric service territory comprises just 2.5% of the geographic footprint of the state of Texas, but we consume nearly 25% and of ERCOT's peak summer load. At the same time, our service territories need to import up to 60% of that load from generators outside our territory. This requirement to import a significant portion of the energy that is consumed in the Houston area, each and every day creates a risk of disruption.\nAs this summer is illustrated, when Houston endures sustained high temperatures, statewide power generation can struggle to keep up with demand and the need for additional transmission lines to deliver a cheaper and more diverse power supply for our customers in the Houston area becomes even more apparent. On top of the $2.3 billion described above, we have separately identified other capital investment opportunities of $3 billion, which we will opportunistically integrate into our long-term capital plan. These additional opportunities include even more grid modernization and system reliability investments as well as the increased investments for accelerated electrification in the Houston area, including EVs.\nAs a reminder, we conservatively estimate that each light-duty EV brings approximately $80 in margin to us per year. The Houston area remains a laggard in the adoption with about 30,000 EVs on its roads today. None of the potential future earnings upside from additional EV penetration is reflected in our current earnings forecast. Furthermore, the $3 billion in additional future capital spend I mentioned earlier, does not fully include the potential impact of increased or accelerated EV adoption.\nWith nearly 5 million cars in the Houston area, that is a lot of potential upside. The remaining $3 billion of opportunities beyond the $2.3 billion that we've added to our investment plan through 2030, also provides capital upside and additional potential earnings power for us. However, as is our management team's history, we are taking a prudent approach and are not yet adding it to our capital plan.\nWe will start to add these amounts incrementally to our planned capital spend once we are convinced, we can access the labor, nail down the availability of the equipment and deploy it to the benefit of our customers. In other words, we fully expect to include the $3 billion balance of the $5.3 billion of these other new capital opportunities on our plan when we believe we can operationally execute it, efficiently fund it and prudently recover it. This approach is no different than our recent history of folding incremental capital into our plan once we are convinced, we can efficiently deploy it to benefit our customers. The customer benefits of our revised capital plan are exciting and tangible, enhancing both reliability and resiliency while also helping us to advance the restoration of service during outages.\nTo summarize this capital spend. This will increase our current capital plan by $2.3 billion, which now totals nearly $43 billion through 2030. As I stated today, we are only including $2.3 billion of investments in our updated capital plan, which we believe we have the crews and materials can efficiently finance while remaining focused on overall affordability at the same time, customers are facing rising energy costs. The remaining $3 billion will be folded in once it also meets that same criterion, which we believe will be achievable through prior securitization charges rolling off, our commitment to O&M discipline and the continued organic growth in our Houston Electric service territory.\nThis increased capital investment will also contribute to our ongoing efforts to reduce O&M over the longer term, which will help continue to keep customer bills affordable. Included in our capital spend are grid modernization investments such as circuit reclosers and other smart grid investments that will reduce the number of truck rolls to restore power, which should translate into lower O&M costs that directly benefit our customers. The benefit of O&M savings is exemplified by the fact that every dollar saved of O&M roughly translates to $8 that can be invested as capital for the benefit of customers. This ability to reduce O&M along with prior securitization charges coming off the bill in 2022 and 2024 and continued organic growth creates a perfect opportunity to invest incremental capital to the benefit of our customers while keeping customer charges affordable.\nWe believe our continued O&M discipline in organically growing Houston customer base will also allow us to make these investments, while customer charge increases stay below the average historical level of inflation of 2%. This is in line with the increase to our charges that we've seen for our Houston Electric customers over the last 10 years, which averaged a little over 1% annually. We also still expect to reduce our O&M by 1% to 2% per year on average over our 10-year plan. And in case you're wondering, this updated capital plan still does not require us to issue any additional external equity nor does it rely on the use of strategic proceeds from the sale of any additional regulated CenterPoint assets as our cash flow remains strong. This is a nice combination in a great position to be in today.\nJason will walk you through our capital investment financing plan in a few minutes. Importantly, recovering our updated capital plan does not rely on any big bets as approximately 80% of the total plan can be recovered through interim regulatory mechanisms. And again, Jason will go into more detail on the funding and financial details of this in his section.\nSo in summary, before I turn the call over to Jason, our management team is committed to executing and what we believe is one of the most tangible growth stories in the industry, which is driven by the growth profile of our largest jurisdiction, the Houston area. Our customer-driven investments are focused on meeting our customers' desire for reliable and cleaner energy so they can continue to contribute to one of the country's strongest and fastest-growing economies. We will look to deliver on those investments while keeping customer charges affordable, targeting charge increases at or below an average of 2% annually through 2030.\nAs we continue to engage with stakeholders, we believe additional customer-driven opportunities can be identified, and we look forward to furthering those customer discussions to help them achieve their own objectives. We reiterate 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.37 to $1.39, a 9% growth rate over 2021, while initiating 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.48 to $1.50 per share, a further 8% growth. After that, we continue to target a further 8% growth through 2024 and at the mid- to high end of 6% to 8% annually thereafter through 2030 and industry-leading growth rate. As a result of customer-driven initiatives, we have identified $2.3 billion of new capital and $3 billion of future capital to increase resiliency, grid modernization as well as to facilitate expanded electrification that will drive additional potential earnings power.\nWe believe our continued focus on over delivering on our commitments has served our customers and investors well and will continue into the future. We are proud of our 10 consecutive quarters of execution and look to build on that streak while also delivering above expectations for the benefit of both our customers and our investors. Lastly, we remain focused on achieving our value proposition, which is striving for sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers, sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our third quarter call. And thank you, Dave, for those kind comments. I sincerely appreciate your continued mentorship, and I also want to take a moment to thank the Board for their continued support. I am humbled and honored to work alongside this great team we have here at CenterPoint in a different capacity starting next year. and I will remain committed to continuing to over deliver for all of our stakeholders as I approach this new role.\nNow I'll start by covering the financial results for the quarter as shown on Slide 5. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.30 for the third quarter of 2022. Similar to the second quarter, our GAAP EPS results include a portion of the tax on the gain on sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs, which we are required under GAAP to recognize over the course of the full year. On a non-GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $0.25 for the same period in 2021.\nGrowth in rate recovery contributed $0.05, largely driven by continued organic customer growth and capital recovery mechanisms for Houston Electric, which included TCOS and 1 month of DCRF recovery. Usage for this quarter was a favorable variance of $0.02 when compared to the same quarter of 2021, largely driven by warmer weather than normal that we've been experiencing here in the Greater Houston area.\nOngoing cost management was a benefit of $0.02 for the quarter, and we have been able to pull forward work for the benefit of our customers due to favorable weather through the second and third quarters of this year. This included accelerating additional vegetation management work into 2022, which began in the second quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our average annual 1% to 2% O&M reductions over the 10-year plan. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.04, $0.01 of which related to absorbing costs previously allocated to our midstream segment in 2021. Other items contributed another $0.01 of favorable variance over the comparable quarter in 2021. Included in these other drivers are miscellaneous revenues and the disallowance of the 2021 winter storm-related extraordinary gas cost recovery by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.\nAs Dave mentioned, we are initiating non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.48 to $1.50 for 2023, which represents 8% growth over the midpoint of our previously increased 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.37 to $1.39. We continue to target 8% growth in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of the 6% to 8% range annually thereafter through 2030.\nBefore I turn to the future capital updates, I want to note that we are tracking nicely against our 2022 capital plan as seen on Slide 6. Through the third quarter, we spent $3.2 billion, which represents nearly 70% of the updated current year $4.6 billion capital plan target. Again, these figures include the incremental $300 million investment in grid hardening that Dave discussed.\nNow shifting to the long-term capital plan and its corresponding earnings growth. As Dave already touched upon, we are updating our capital investment plan to include an incremental $2.3 billion of customer-driven capital, which now totals nearly $43 billion of capital to be deployed through 2030. Because we continue to update on our previously announced 10-year capital plan, which we are already 2 years into, this is really increasing the remaining 8 years by $2.3 billion. Furthermore, we have an additional $3 billion of potential opportunities that we will continue to evaluate to determine the appropriate time to incorporate these in our capital plan.\nYou may notice on Slide 17 of the appendix, that the timing of our capital deployment has shifted somewhat from our last Analyst Day. As I will discuss later, the Posey solar project is now expected to be placed into service in 2024 rather than the end of 2023. In light of the supply chain delays and in line with what we previously communicated, this shift in our capital profile was not completely unexpected and does not change our view of our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2023 or beyond because of the capital investment we announced we executed on earlier this year. It is also important to reiterate the recovery of this incremental capital is not based on any big bets. It is a series of small projects that we expect will be recovered through our routine and recurring interim capital recovery mechanisms. The result of the incremental $2.3 billion customer-driven capital investment will drive a rate base CAGR of over 9.5% through 2030.\nWe are not updating our longer-term non-GAAP EPS growth guidance of 8% in 2024 and at the mid- to high end of the 6% to 8% range annually thereafter through 2030 despite this increase in capital investment. That is because it's very important to remember that we have a large number of rate cases in 2024 that will begin to set rates in 2025. We will update our long-term non-GAAP EPS growth estimates after those cases are resolved. However, I want to reiterate this additional capital investment we are announcing today will undoubtedly provide incremental earnings power for the company. Our goal continues to be delivering industry-leading growth each and every year while over delivering for our customers and our shareholders.\nOn the matter of upcoming rate cases, we are taking measured steps to achieve constructive outcomes for all stakeholders. For example, we have already funded Houston Electric's current capital structure with 45% equity despite the current improved capital structure being 42.5%. When looking at other non-ERCOT Texas utilities, national averages and the fact we have potential exposure to severe weather, we believe a 45% equity ratio is the minimum level that should be considered going forward. We've not assumed an increase in our equity ratio and our long-term EPS growth guidance, but we will work with our stakeholders to find a constructive resolution in our next rate case.\nNow turning to the financing of our capital plan. As Dave discussed, the updated capital plan does not require external equity financing, nor does it require the sale of any of our rate-regulated utility assets. The capital plan is expected to be funded through OpCo debt consistent with our regulatory capital structure and higher FFO from potential changes in capital structure or the cash currently funding the 45% equity ratio at Houston Electric, for which we only have approval for 42.5%. I also want to point out that we used some conservative cash estimates at our previous Analyst Day, specifically around cash taxes associated with the sales of energy transfer units and gas LDCs. This provided an additional source of cash that we can use to help fund this incremental capital.\nWe believe we'll be able to deliver on this increased capital plan while still targeting long-term FFO to debt of 14% to 15%, as of the end of the third quarter, our FFO to debt was over 15% above our stated target aligning with Moody's methodology. Shifting gears, there has been some concern among shareholders around the level of floating rate debt some utilities have. I want to address this topic. We intentionally entered 2022 with an elevated level of variable rate debt as we knew we were going to delever using the strategic proceeds from the sale of energy transfer units in the Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs. We have paid down over $1.6 billion in floating rate debt this year, resulting in a 35% reduction in floating rate debt since the beginning of 2022. In addition, as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, we have reduced our parent level to total debt by 9 percentage points from the beginning of the year and project to be around 20% by the end of the year.\nWith our continued focus on reducing parent-level debt as a percentage of total debt and successful restructuring of the legacy vector and legal entities, next year, we will look to finance (inaudible) at the OpCo level, which should allow us to reduce parent-level debt by another $640 million, resulting in a more normalized and efficient financing structure for both our customers and our investors. One other item to note is we have the ability to file rate cases earlier than previously communicated and will likely take this approach for CERC. We anticipate CERC filing a Texas rate case in mid-2023 and which will allow us to update our revenue requirement for, among other things, increased interest costs.\nMoving on to a broader regulatory update on Slide 9. In Minnesota, we saw the full recovery of the $409 million of extraordinary gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. While at the same time, we sought to minimize the impact on our customers by extending the recovery of that amount to 5 years. In May, the 2 administrative law judges that heard the evidence concluded that we acted prudently to procure gas to serve our customers during the extreme event. Unfortunately, in a split decision, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission disallowed recovery of approximately $36 million of the total $409 million incurred or about 8.7% of the total. Similar percentage disallowances were applied by the Minnesota PUC to other companies that had excess gas cost in the state. As this case continues, we will work towards an outcome that we believe is both fair for our customers and CenterPoint alike.\nWe also have a couple of securitizations that we continue to make progress towards completing. In Texas, the securitization related to extraordinary gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri continues to work its way through the regulatory process, and we expect to receive the approximately $1.1 billion of bond proceeds by the end of 2022.\nIn Indiana, we continue to work with stakeholders to finalize a first-of-its-kind $360 million securitization of the A. B. Brown coal facilities that will result in savings for our Indiana electric customers. We are expecting a decision by the end of this year, and if the financing order is approved, a bond issuance would occur sometime in the first quarter of 2023. Aside from the extraordinary gas cost and securitizations, we have a few other regulatory items I want to highlight. We had a constructive outcome in our gas rate case in Minnesota, where we settled our rate case, which resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $48.5 million. In addition, we filed for our second TCOS recovery in Texas for approximately $38 million, which we anticipate to start recovering in November this year.\nMoving to our Integrated Resource Plan update. We're focused on delivering on our Indiana generation transition to support our net zero goals. And as I just discussed, we are still on track to receive a securitization order by the end of 2022 and bond proceeds in Q1 of 2023. Our Posey County Solar asset was originally expected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2023. The project is now anticipated to be placed in service in 2024 due to supply chain delays. Given this delay, the forecasted capital amount for 2023 on the electric side has been shifted to 2024. But as a reminder, we are able to begin recovery as soon as the plant is placed into service. To enhance the disclosures around our progress of our energy transition, we have also published our first task force on climate-related finance disclosures report, which we committed to at our 2021 Analyst Day. As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason. And once again, congratulations. As you heard from us today, we have 10 straight quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations. We are a pure play regulated utility with industry-leading incremental growth opportunities driven by our customer demands.\n\nJackie Richert\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. Operator, we are now ready to turn the call over to Q&A."

At our customers' request, this conference will be recorded. (Operator Instructions) I now hand you over to Stephane Dedeyan, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephane Dedeyan\n\nCEO, CNP Assurances SA\n\nHello, everybody. Thank you for having joined us for this conference. I will start our presentation with the highlights. And I will then leave the floor to Thomas Behar in order to elaborate about business and financial performance, solvency ratio, asset liability management, corporate social responsibility, and I will end with the outlook.\nTo go directly to the main figures, Page 4. As you can see, our results are very good with a very important dynamic in terms of premium income, which are increasing, up 22%, with an attributable net profit up 8.4% and still a very solid coverage ratio, up 32 points compared to end of last year solvency ratio at 249%. Something which is noticeable is that the premiums are coming from outside of France for 48%, which is quite significant and shows the international development of CNP Assurance.\nNow if I go to the highlights, I would like to insist on 5 points. First -- the first point is the robustness of the group and its capacity to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. A few words about all the opportunities that come from the fact that we are now a member of the major state-owned financial group. An overview of our international multi-partnership model, the fact that we have made significant progress in the structuration of our model outside France. And last, the fact that we are very committed in the socially responsible investment.\nTo go through the first point, what we can say that our balance sheet was very well prepared to the changing macroeconomic environment. We had planned and secured our 2022 investment income, and our asset liability match was designed to be able to profit from the raise in the interest rates. And you can see it in the progression of our solvency coverage ratio up 32 points, attesting to the group's preparedness for the changing environment and creating the headroom needed to support future growth.\nAs you know already, we have a very strong PPE. It's now up 7%. So it's -- we are a major player in France with a very strong PPE, which will help us accompany the raise of the interest rates. But this is not because our balance sheet was well prepared to the raise of the interest rates that we don't continue to transform our technical reserves. 32.4% of the new money is invested in unit-linked funds. This is an increase of almost 4 points compared to last year. And we continue to be very active on the so-called transfer PACTE, which means that we are able to bring the money from the customer from all contracts to new contracts, and we profit of this movement to increase the unit-linked rate, which contribute to transform our technical reserves to a more resilient setup.\nSo at the end, what is very -- the important message here is to say that we have a very flexible and efficient management of our balance sheet.\nSecond point, all the opportunities brought by the fact that we are a member of the major state-owned financial group. First, this creates a complete alignment of interest with La Banque Postale. And we see already the progress made. Thanks to this complete alignment of interest, the unit-linked weighting is up 3.1 points. The PACTE transfers are very, very active with a possibility to obtain a better unit-linked rate after the transfer. And we managed to launch the new product with a capital guarantee that also covers the loading, which is very good in terms of solvency. And also, we have a very dynamic activity in term creditor insurance with 11.2% of increase.\nWhat we aim also being part of La Banque Postale Group is to become a full-service insurer and to be able to upgrade our specific model. I will elaborate a little bit later on what is the specificity of our model. But today, our model is turned towards personal insurance. And what we want to do is to upgrade it and to become a full stack insurer combining P&C and life insurance.\nIt's also the opportunity for us to enhance the customer experience, leveraging artificial intelligence, data and developing end-to-end customer experience. We have a specific project named Cap Assurance on that, and we are making good progress in our capacity to deliver a very fluid customer experience. And also, this is the opportunity to develop other lines of business. And for instance, we have a very strong activity in Caution, which is a way to guarantee La Banque when she makes some lendings. And we have made some pilots, which are really successful. And we are now going to generalize these pilots, which means that we create some new opportunities of growth. And I think this is -- the main point here is to say that this successful tender offer by La Banque Postale to have now 100% of our capital is a very good way to upgrade the model and the growth capacities of CNP Assurances on the French market.\nThird point is to -- just to have an overview of our international multi-partnership model. As you can see on Slide 9, we have 3 main areas of action. The first one, of course, the historical one, is the French area, where we are the leading provider of term creditor insurance and the second largest life insurance with the first leg, which is strong book insurance partnerships. And the other leg of the model is what we see open fee, where we are having development in a more traditional way with brokers or with IFAs or some minor partnerships. This 2 legs model, we have it in France with the first leg strategic bank insurance agreement with La Banque Postale, of course, and BPCE Group, but also we have a very strong second line in France, working with brokers, with some private banks or with recently -- more recently, Santander Consumer France.\nIn Europe, we had a very strong first leg with a strategic agreement with UniCredit. And as you've seen yesterday, we have announced the fact that we have entirely designed a 2-leg model with, of course, the first leg with UniCredit, a very strong one. And a second leg, open fee model, acquiring the 49% stake of UniCredit in the ex-Aviva Life Insurance Company. So we now have a very strong 2-leg model in Italy, which is really the specificity of the CNP model, being able to combine all the assets and all the advantages of the bank insurance model, but also all the advantages of the traditional insurance with more open partnerships.\nAnd we have also our strong presence in Brazil since 2001. We are the third insurer in Brazil. It's really growing fast and very profitable. And as you know, we have this very strong first leg with Caixa Economica Federal, which is the second public largest bank in Brazil. 1 Brazilian out of 2 is customer of Caixa Economica Federal. So this is a very strong first leg, and we are working on developing the second leg at the moment.\nIf we now get down into each area, in France, we have made a very strong movement in term creditor insurance, going above the requirements of a new law in France, and we have frozen the insurance rates for standard term creditors, and we have frozen also the level 2 area surcharge for borrowers that have an aggravated risk. So this movement is something which is very strong in terms of our purpose and of our positioning towards a very inclusive society and bringing our stone to the present difficulties of the French people with the inflation and so on. So we think this is a very strong move to explain the usefulness of the insurance business for the French people.\nWe are very dynamic with BPCE in term creditor insurance and also very dynamic in the PACTE transfers, which shows that the second strategic partnership, Bancassurance partnership is also very strong.\nWhat is important to say also and to highlight is that in France, we have a very, very strong presence in the premium segment with CNP Patrimoine with very good results with a unit-linked rate of 50% and also a premium income just below EUR 2 billion. And we developed a multi-partner model also with Louvre Banque Privée, which is a subsidiary of La Banque Postale. And more recently, we have signed an agreement with Santander Consumer Bank, and this is something that is very interesting for our second leg, meaning the open model and showing that we are very dynamic on the first leg, but also on the second leg.\nSpeaking now about Europe, 2 main points here. First, the success of our activities in Italy in terms of growth, but also in terms of our capacity to develop a strong 2-leg model in Italy, as I already elaborated on the -- in the credit agreement that we signed and that we announced yesterday. So as you can see, we have now a very strong position in Italy with a very good dynamic in premiums. And as you can see, this -- the 2 legs are quite balanced because we have EUR 2 billion with UniCredit in the first leg. And we also have EUR 2.7 billion with other partners, meaning that we think that we have a lot of opportunities of development in Italy.\nAnd I would like also to mention CNP Santander. As you know, with CNP Santander, we have a presence in 11 European countries, and we just launched a new country, Portugal, which means that this partnership is also very active and very dynamic.\nMoving on to Latin America now. You know that last year, we launched our new joint ventures with Caixa Economica Federal. We had to bring them on the market and to be successful very quickly. So it's the case, as you can see, with a very significant growth in Pension business and also the complementarity between the consórcio model and the Caixa Vida e Previdência model, meaning when the interest rates are high, the consumer credit is not so dynamic and we can make consórcio. And when the interest rates are lower, there is a lot of dynamic in the consumer credit and less in consórcio. That means that whatever the level of the interest rates, we have the answer for the customer, and that means that our model in Latin America and in Brazil is very resilient.\nAnd to just emphasize the agreement we reached with UniCredit and to detail it, as you can see, we had also 100% of the capital of CNP Vita Assicurazione for EUR 1 billion premium income. And now we have 100% of the other subsidiary of Aviva that we acquired 2 years ago with EUR 1.5 billion premium income, and we have now 100% of the capital. We are going to develop synergies between those 2 entities to create the second leg that will give us a lot of opportunities and room for development.\nAnd last but not least, we've reached an agreement with Swiss Life to have a prolongation of our strategic agreement on assistance. Assistance is for us very important issue because it's the way to enrich the insurance product with services. So for us, it's now entirely in our model because we have bought the stakes of Swiss Life in our Filassistance subsidiary in the last month. So that means that we have now the complete mastering of our Assistance tool. And we think this is very important to have differentiating offers and to be able to combine services and insurance to differentiate on the market. And what is important is that we have both the stake of Swiss Life, but without ending the partnership, which means the dynamic of our capacity to partner with major actors.\nThomas Behar will elaborate after me. Just to mention our strong commitments underpinned by our corporate mission, we are -- it's very important for us to make sure that we have a more inclusive offer. And the fact that we have an unparalleled risk pooling capacity in term creditor insurance has allow us, as I said, to freeze the tariff in term creditor insurance, which means that it helps French people to master inflation and also is very inclusive for people with aggravated health risk.\nAnd moving from the offer to the investments, as you know, we are very committed to align with Paris Agreement, and we are making very good progress towards the 1.5 Celsius degree trajectory. We are pioneer in biodiversity commitments. Thomas will elaborate on that after. And as you know, also, we apply ESG criteria to 99.8% of our traditional savings funds, which means that when people come and buy the CMP project, they can be sure that it's very good for the planet and that it's very inclusive and for a sustainable world.\nAnd last but not least, our governance is well balanced in the Executive Committee and also in the Board of Directors.\nI will leave now the floor to Thomas to elaborate on our business and financial performance.\n\nThomas Behar\n\nDeputy CEO & Head of Financial Information, CNP Assurances SA\n\nThank you very much, Stephane. As CFO and Deputy CEO, it's always a pleasure to see the fruit of the strategy in the numbers. And you can see them on the Page 16, where you can see all our very good numbers for this half year accounts.\nOn the sales, we are quite at the level of EUR 20 billion, which is a very good historic number for us. It's a growth of 22.4% in comparison to last year coming from the steps that we had with the acquisition of CNP Vita Assicura and CNP Vita Assicurazione. You will see just after we have a 70% growth for our international activities that reflect in this number. Like-for-like, it's a growth of 2.2%. The EBIT also show a very strong growth. The EBIT is at EUR 1,874 million with a growth of 21.2%. So we have the step with CNP Vita Assicura, Assicurazione. We have also a good effect at this time about the currency effect coming from the real. But also, we have a growth coming from the accounts, but also from each of the 3 areas of the group where you have a solid growth of the net insurance revenue for Lat Am for Europe and from France.\nLike-for-like, we have a growth of 13.5%. So net profit, we are at EUR 748 million with a very growth of 8.4%. And I would like to remind you about the PPE. We had an additional around EUR 400 million of PPE during this first half year. The solvency capital ratio is at 249%, an increase of 32% -- 32 points due to the very good economic conditions that we meet at the end of June. And we have a very strong ratings, A+, A1, A+ according to the 3 main rating agencies.\nLet's go now to the performance market, coming first for the international markets where we have the growth in the sales. It's 70% which is a very high number of growth. You can see that it comes from the CVA contribution, which now represents 29% of international premium income and 48% premium income in Europe, excluding France. But you can see that this growth has constant scope and exchange rates is very good in each of the 2 areas, it's a growth for like-for-like of 11.6% for Latin America and 10.9% for Europe, excluding France. So we are going on the international activities, and the international activities now represent 48% of the sales of the group. So we are both at parity in France and abroad France.\nOn the EBIT side, you can see also the very good growth of 39% coming from EUR 439 million to EUR 610 million. Like-for-like, it's a 12.4% increase. And you can see that this increase comes either from Latin America, which is a growth of 7% and a growth of 30.3% for Europe, excluding France without the increase coming from CNP Vita Assicura. So we are in a very good position of dynamism, either on the premium income and also on the EBIT side, for our performance in Europe.\nComing now to France. Ratio is quite different. We have a slight reduction of the premium income. 2.6%, but this reduction has a very good continuity in the way we are looking for a very good quality of the underwriting. So we are moving from euro component to unit-linked components on the sales that we are doing on savings. We have an increase of 9.9% of the unit-linked Savings/Pensions and a reduction of 8.6% of the traditional Savings and Pensions. We are quite stable, an additional load 7% on the personal risk/protection. Nowadays, the percentage of unit-linked products on our sales represent a weight of 32.4%. So it's an additional weight of around 4 points in comparison to last year.\nAnd we are continuing to do very good performance on highway contract with EUR 1.7 billion premium that we have issued during the first part of the year. On the net money, you can see the same in the same way that we are moving from euro component to unit-linked component. We are positive on unit-linked savings and pension with EUR 1.8 million billion additional net new money and a reduction of around EUR 3 billion on the traditional savings and pension.\nOn the EBIT side, you have an additional increase of 14.1%, which is very good. As you can see, it doesn't come from the premium income. It's not due to the volume as a global, but it comes first from the higher revenue from portfolio. We have done -- we have realized all our capital gain at the beginning of the year, but we have also a very good performance on the quality of the underwriting results with a reduction of the claims on credit insurance. And we have also the fruit of the move from euro component to unit-linked component.\nIf we go now to Page 19 with the control cost-to-income ratio. You can see that we continue to be very good on the cost-to-income ratio even if we have still -- we have, in France, in Europe and in Latin America, a very high pressure on the remuneration of the staff. And so -- and we are aligned with what is done in the market in the 3 different areas. Nevertheless, we continue to have a very good performance in France and in Europe excluding France.\nIn Latin America, as you can see with the 16%, we have a very, very low level and the slight evolution that you can see come from the autonomy that we are getting from the different joint ventures that we have now in Brazil, and they are autonomous, one from the other, meaning that we have to increase the costs.\nLet's go now to Page 20, how we are going from the EBIT to the attributable net profit. I would highlight the nonrecurring items of EUR 292 million, which is the allocation that we have done for the policyholder surplus reserve of around EUR 4 million. Decision on policyholder surplus reserve and policy discretionary profit will be done at the end of the year.\nOn the line, which is -- the column which is discontinued operation, minus EUR 61 million, it comes from the widen of CNP Partners assets, which is in a process of sales in Spain.\nLet's go now to -- we have seen about the performance. Let's go now to the solidity of the group. We have a very strong solvency capital ratio with 249%. Where does it come -- where does the increase come from? It comes from the market changes, an additional 29 points in comparison to last year. That's why I would like to say about solvency capital ratio.\nYou have now on the different slides, the way we see the leverage ratio and what we can include issue as debt. You can see that the leverage ratio is at 32%. And of course, it is due to the fact that we have reduction of the own funds due to the market condition evolution, which is due to the bond portfolio, which has affected the equity.\nOn Page 24, we have just a reminder about our decision capacity according to Solvency II, which is EUR 5 billion on Tier 1, which is EUR 1.8 billion on Tier 2 and EUR 0.3 billion on Tier 3.\nAnd last, on Page 25, you have the interest cover of 14.9 and the average coupon weight of 2.8. The decrease comes from the very good financial condition that we got during the last years where we were able to replace old issue by new issue with a lower interest rate, and it can be seen in these numbers.\nAccording to the future, of course, we are always in the tradition to have regular issues year after year. But also, we are looking to all these numbers to decide about new issuance.\nLast, we remind you on Page 26, about the opinion of all the 3 rating agencies that are rating CNP Assurances.\nI would like now to go to assessability management. And of course, in this new world condition, the ALM, of course, has changed a little bit. You can see on Page 28, how we are going for unit-linked, which is now at the group level represents 49.5% as a percentage of unit-linked on the total saving patients. And on the average technical reserve, we have now -- we are now at 23.6%.\nIt's a long way, of course, to transform savings in France. We are adding 1.5 years. So now it's -- we are at 15%.\nOn the replacement rate, we -- what is very new is our ability to look at higher interest rates for the new business, and we have now it's completely changed, multiplied by 2 what we can get from the market and Q2 2022, we are around 2% for the average effective interest rate at purchase for all the new assets that we got. And I would say that it's an average between April, May and June. And even in May and June, it was more than 2% that we could get from our assets. It enabled us to change the maturity of what we have purchased and also, of course, the yield that we can get.\nSo we have the new points with a percentage. And 1 year before, you have the points which -- where you have no numbers. So you can see that we have increased by around more than 1 point of yield that we can get from corporates, from banks and from savings, but also that we were able with this increase to reduce the maturity, the average maturity for each for the sovereigns. The reduction is a little bit lighter for banks and corporates.\nThat's for the performance. And of course, we will be able to answer all your questions after. I would like also to elaborate a little bit about corporate and social responsibility, which is part of the performance as we see from CNP Assurances. We have the performance -- the financial performance but also the global performance that we think we -- which is due to all our stakeholders, not only the shareholders but also all the different counterparts that the group is facing.\nIf you look first for the climate change. What you can see is that we met all our targets or we exceed them, which enable us to get to new targets. The case for total green investments, we had a target of EUR 20 billion, and we have exceeded this target at mid-2022 with EUR 20 billion of assets on green investments. That's why we have upgraded this target. And so we are committed to go to EUR 25 billion at the end of 2025.\nFor the carbon footprint, so we continue to decarbon all our portfolio. We had the target of reduction of 25%, between 29% and 24%. We made this target with 42% of reduction. As we meet the target. So we are looking for fixing the new targets, and we'll be able to communicate about these new targets when it will be fixed later this year.\nOn the carbon footprint of the property portfolio, we have also met the target with 10% reduction. And again, we will fix a new target.\nNew matter is protecting biodiversity so when we are very poised to be being one of the first investors to publish investment performance based on 2 criterias, which is impact on and dependent on biodiversity. On the impact of diversity directly to CNP Assurances, we have a reduction of the impact on biodiversity, which is now only 25 MFA, where it was more than 50 last time we published this number. We have now 58% of the directly owned securities issued by companies where we have the biodiversity footprint, which is measured. Our target is to have 100% by the end of 2023.\nOn the other side is how biodiversity affects the undertakings where we have invested. We have now 26%. We are able to say that 26% of the securities that we own are heavily or very heavily dependent on at least one ecosystem service, which could be water filtration, pollination, disease control, erosion control and so on. So it's something that we are looking very carefully on how we impact biodiversity but also how biodiversity impact us. So we are one of the first investors to do that, and we are committed to continue and develop this approach.\nOn the second part of ESG, so we are also very committed for an inclusive and sustainable society. It's something that Stephane Dedeyan has already spoken about, which is the term creditor insurance. Perhaps you know that in France, we have a new law, which is Lemoine Law, which has done some requirement to facilitate access to home loans, removing health questions for lower amount of credit. And so we are very good on the commitments that we have as an inclusive and sustainable insurer to go beyond the law. And with our partners and mentioned others La Banque Postale, we committed to go above and beyond the requirements of this law. With 2 matters, we have fallen our interest rates, whereas competitors usually have increased their rates with the introduction of the law.\nAnd the second part we decided to have no premium surcharge for aggravated health risk. So it's part of the rule. We would like to says that we are acting with -- which is in link with the size of CNP Assurances. And the fact that we are able to play the virtualization of the risk at the level of CNP Assurances, and we can absorb risk and push the limits of insurance as fast as we can for all the people that we are insuring.\nOn the second part is SFDR, the new European law, and we have 99.8% that have ESG criteria according to the law of Article 8 for the euro components. And on the unit-linked component, 52% of our funds are meeting the criteria of Article 8 of the SFDR law and 14% of the Article 9.\nLast point about the ESG is a parity. So we are very good about parity on the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. You can see on the numbers of senior market management, but we have still progress to do, 36% of senior management are women. And we are committed to go to 45% as a target for 2025.\nOn Page 36, we remind you of the very good ratings that we have from the various ESG rating agencies. So that's for the global performance in addition to the financial performance.\nI will now give back the floor to Stephane Dedeyan to give you an outlook about the future.\n\nStephane Dedeyan\n\nCEO, CNP Assurances SA\n\nAnd to finish with the outlook -- thank you, Thomas. Just to highlight what are the main points of the new background. First, we are in a higher interest rates and inflation. We face mature European markets. And as you know, we have also increased customer expectations.\nSo in this environment, I think we have 2 main challenges. The first one is to keep our solidity in this new macroeconomic paradigm. And as you can, as you have seen, and I think Thomas was very explicit about it, our balance sheet is really solid, and we think we have all the reserve -- the necessary reserves to our company, the raise of interest rates with our products to make sure that we don't face massive lapses.\nAnd second, we need in our B2B model to become absolutely at the core of the value chain because our main risk is to be invisible only by the eyes -- through the eyes of the customer and also considered as a commodity by our partners. And in a mature market, the development will be more difficult. So we will have to develop a real singularity. I've explained about the singularity and the uniqueness of our model with those 2 legs. I think this is a very strong differentiation factor for us. And we proved the good results of this model with our figures.\nBut what we need to -- we need to go further in order to make sure that we can sustain our development strategy and we ambition to be the most useful and unique insurer to make sure that our offer is a more desirable one and then we can really bring value to our partners. How are we going to do that? First, we think that the fact that day after day, we fulfill our corporate mission will make us even more unique and will make us desirable in all the tender offers that we have to answer in order to develop with this famous 2 legs model.\nAnd second, we don't want only to be a producer of good insurance products. We also want to become an essential link in the value chain and to be able to bring some insights of development to our partners. So we are working very hard to develop a very agile IT system and also to develop some specific services that can help our partners develop. We work on artificial intelligence models and scoring models that can be very good assets for them to develop.\nSo for us, our development strategy will lead to a triple change of dimension for CNP Assurance. First, we will become a full-service insurance, bringing our model not only in the life insurance business but also in the P&C one. Second, as you can see, we are developing very fast in the international field. And Brazil is growing very fast. And our recent acquisition in Italy show that they are good relay for growth. And we also think that this differentiation on the French market can make the difference and become a full-service insurer with La Banque Postale with all the potential of the customer of La Banque Postale is a strong way for us to continue to develop even in mature markets as France and Europe.\nAnd third, of course, if we want to do that in a very efficient way. We have to operate as an integrated company and to entirely accept the fact that now we are a global group. When you have 48% of your premiums coming from outside France, you cannot say anymore that we are a French company with international subsidiary. We are now a global group, which aims at working in a very more integrated way, and that's what we are working on. I can tell you that this is tremendously enthusiastic for the teams and that we think we will continue to deliver half year after half year and to bring you value and a good strategy and a good utility of insurance for the society.\nSo thank you very much. So now we are open to questions with the team.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) As there are no questions, I hand back to the speakers.\n\nStephane Dedeyan\n\nCEO, CNP Assurances SA\n\nOkay. So if you don't have any questions, we hope that, that means that we have been clear with Thomas. Thank you very much for having joined us, and we hope to see you again at the end of the year. And as you can see, we are very committed and very confident in the solidity of CNP Assurances and its capacity to deliver its strategy. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You may disconnect now."

(Operator Instructions) There will be a question-and-answer session after management's remarks. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Jackie Richert, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Richert?\n\nJackie Richert\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to CenterPoint's earnings conference call. Dave Lesar, our CEO; and Jason Wells, our CFO, will discuss the company's first quarter 2022 results.\nManagement will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon various factors as noted in our Form 10-Q, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. When providing guidance, we use the non-GAAP EPS measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis, referred to as non-GAAP EPS. For information on our guidance methodology and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to our earnings news release and presentation, both of which can be found under the Investors section on our website.\nAs a reminder, we may use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jackie. Good morning, and thank you to everyone joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'll run through our latest highlights and headlines as we continue to build on our consistent track record of earnings delivery.\nFirst, we have now delivered 8 straight quarters of operational execution by this current management team. We are now among the pure-play utilities having sold our remaining energy transfer position and fully exiting our midstream investment well before the year-end 2022 target that we committed to you. The 2022 ET common and preferred net proceeds were approximately $490 million after taxes, bringing the combined total net proceeds from the ultimate divestiture of Enable to approximately $1.3 billion after taxes. In addition, following our first quarter Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC divestiture, our rate base is now forecasted to be 62% electric based on 2022 year-end projections, getting us into the range of some of our premium utility peers.\nWe utilized the total net after-tax proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion from these 2 transactions to pay down associated debt and plan to recycle the remaining cash to fund our industry-leading rate base growth, all without planned external equity issuances. We are also on track to meet our $1.36 to $1.38 non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2022, including the $0.47 we reported for the first quarter of 2022.\nKeep in mind that the gas LDCs we sold removed $0.03 from earnings this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2021, and the full year impact of the loss of the divested gas LDCs will normalize to about $0.02 when compared to last year. We also reiterate our non-GAAP EPS annual growth rate guidance of 8% to 2024; and from there, the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% growth guidance through 2030, and Jason will get into these details shortly.\nWe also continue to see organic growth across our system, including 11 consecutive years of 2% or greater customer growth in the Houston Electric area, a differentiating luxury many other utilities just do not have. We continued working with our customers to identify their needs for increased safety, reliability and clean, sustainable investments, including Houston's master energy plan called Resilient Now, which is helping us to determine further capital planning decisions. And we will have more to say on that in future quarters.\nMore importantly, we remain focused on keeping our bills affordable for our customers. We believe that the combination of expected organic growth across our jurisdictions, when combined with our plan to have average reductions of 1% to 2% in O&M per year over the course of our 10-year plan, and the securitization charges rolling out of rates in Houston Electric, will create bill headroom to help reduce the impact of new capital spending.\nThose are our latest headlines. We strive to continue our track record that we've established over the past 2 years of executing on this world-class investment thesis.\nMoving to capital investments. We are in year 2 of our capital plan, which has now increased to $19.3 billion over the next 5 years. This is an increase from the $19.2 billion we discussed at year-end and is our second increase to our 5-year plan since our Analyst Day. Our 10-year plan is still currently expected to be $40 billion plus of investments to support the safety, resiliency and growth across our system to benefit our customers. We expect that this decade of growth will be achieved through traditional utility investments with no big project or technology bets and minimal regulatory lag. This leads to our industry-leading projected rate base growth of 9% CAGR over the 10-year plan.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we invested approximately $1 billion including the mobile generation leases and are now tracking slightly ahead of our capital plan for the full year. Today, we are announcing an increase in our estimated spend for 2022 to $4.3 billion, up from $4 billion as we have accelerated approximately $300 million of work from the latter years of our plan, which Jason will get into shortly.\nAs we execute on the capital investment plan we outlined, we also continue to work closely with our customers to serve their needs, including safety, increased system resiliency in growth to drive further incremental capital investments that are not currently in the $19.3 billion. For example, last quarter, we highlighted the initiative called Resilient Now jointly launched with the city of Houston. We continue to work with the city of Houston and surrounding cities to develop future capital opportunities in the Houston area to help support the community with its continued economic growth, help meet the challenges of more frequent weather events, support the build-out of its EV infrastructure and advance its environmental goals. This includes grid and infrastructure hardening and modernization, residential weatherization and investments around renewable energy infrastructure. This will be a multiyear investment need. We have made good progress with our customers in identifying the framework for continued grid resiliency and will be excited to discuss more on this topic in the fall of this year.\nIn addition to the city-driven initiatives, the broader Houston port area, which includes the world's largest petrochemical complex, refining industries and global LNG export facilities, are experiencing unprecedented investment and increased energy needs. We are anticipating increased loan demand across our system over the next 3 to 5 years to accommodate their continued investment and development needs. This includes at least 1 gigawatt related to expected projects, which, based on current system capacity in that area, will likely accelerate our capital investment plans by a further $150 million to meet those needs once these projects are finalized. And there is likely more opportunities as other projects in this area gain further support and move toward final investment decisions.\nFurthermore, we are also continuing to work with other industrial or manufacturing customers across other areas of our service territory, which could drive further incremental investments. It's fair to say that when our investments are helping support the economic vitality of the communities that we have the privilege to serve, it is an exciting time to be here at CenterPoint.\nShifting to customer affordability. As I stated earlier, as we invest in future capital, we remain focused on how to keep customer bills affordable. One way we can do this is with continued discipline on our operating and maintenance expenses. We have opportunities across our system, which we expect will result in an annual average 1% to 2% of O&M savings over the course of our 10-year plan. It is our responsibility as a management team to strive to achieve this benefit for our customers even in these inflationary times. As we look across our system, we still believe there are plenty of ways to do so.\nOne great example of such work is our Intellis smart meter system deployment, which some of you saw in person back at our Analyst Day. We initially piloted this program in the first quarter of 2021 and began the official deployment here in our Texas gas business last month. These advanced meters are expected to offer safety, environmental, operational and cost benefits for our customers. For example, they are designed to enable automatic shutoffs to help reduce the risk associated with safety events, allow for remote disconnects and centralized meter reads. This program will help drive significant savings across our gas system when deployed fully. We'll soon be working towards implementing this in our other service territories as well.\nSimilarly, our continued execution of our coal transition plan in Indiana is helping avoid what otherwise would be significant customer bill increases related to coal generation. Continued operation of our coal facilities would cost customers an additional $50 per month as federal EPA regulations around operating coal plants, which we are obligated to comply with become increasingly stringent. All things being equal, we currently estimate that the cleaner portfolio of renewables in the gas CT will result in customer bill increases less than the $10 a month we originally anticipated while also significantly reducing our carbon footprint.\nBack in our Houston Electric territory, there will be incremental headroom created through the continued roll-off of charges from securitization bonds associated with the 1999 Electric Market Restructuring Law and Hurricane Ike from 2007. Back in 2019, 2 transition bonds ended. The charges related to these bonds of almost 7% of the average residential bill was then eliminated. The bill charges related to the upcoming storm bond rolling off in August makes up over 3% of the current average residential bill, while the charges related to the remaining transition bond that rolls off in 2024 is approximately another 5% of current average residential bills.\nAll of these things will help reduce the impact to our customers of capital investments across our system, and we will seek to keep executing on these kinds of opportunities to keep bills affordable for our customers.\nSo in summary, before I turn the call over to Jason, we are meeting our customers' growing needs across our system due to both organic growth and by upgrading the current system safety and resiliency needs, which we expect will likely lead to incremental capital above our $40 billion plus over the course of our 10-year plan. And we plan to fund it without issuing external equity and without straining our balance sheet. Despite this growth, we remain committed to providing affordable service by managing our costs, targeting an average 1% to 2% reduction annually in our O&M, taking advantage of our organic growth and benefiting from things like the regulatory charges that are rolling out of rates at Houston Electric.\nOur current capital investment plan leads into our 10-year rate base outlook. We project approximately 11% rate base growth CAGR through 2025, which normalizes into an approximately 9% CAGR over the full 10-year plan. From that rate base, we expect industry-leading 8% annual non-GAAP EPS growth through 2024 in the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% range from there through 2030. And we are excited to share with you later this year the impacts of the expected incremental capital that I have discussed.\nAs I stated in my opening remarks, we are excited about the 8 straight quarters of execution, and all of the employees here at CenterPoint that are delivering results every single day. We heard loud and clear that many of you wanted CenterPoint to exit the midstream industry. We did it in a way we believe was better and quicker than many of you ever expected. Within 4 months of the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, we've sold 100% of our common units at a 20% premium to Energy Transfer's unit price when the transaction was announced last February. Not a bad outcome for those shareholders who thought we would never get out of this investment, let alone receive approximately $1.3 billion of net after-tax proceeds from it. We listen to our investors and are now a pure-play regulated utility with continued growth driven by customer demands. And lastly, we remain focused on achieving our value proposition, which is sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our first quarter call.\nI'll start by covering the financial results for the quarter. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.82 for the first quarter of 2022. This includes midstream-related earnings of $0.05, including the net gain on the sale of the Energy Transfer common and preferred unit sales and the costs associated with the early extinguishment of the related debt as well as the net after-tax gain on our Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC sale of $0.30. Excluding those and other items as noted, we reported $0.47 of non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2022, which was flat to the comparable quarter of 2021, as shown on Slide 5. Our first quarter of 2022 earnings were reduced by $0.03 due to losing the earnings related to Arkansas and Oklahoma operations, which were divested on January 10. And as Dave mentioned, those earnings are seasonally weighted towards the winter months. Our results included favorable growth and rate recovery contributing $0.05 this quarter, while weather, usage and other contributed $0.02 when compared to the first quarter of 2021. These positive benefits were partially offset by $0.03 compared to the same quarter last year due to higher ongoing cost management expenses, $0.01 of which was related to interest expense that was previously allocated to our midstream segment in the first quarter of 2021, which will be absorbed in the consolidated earnings going forward. The remaining variance is related to the timing of our O&M savings in 2021.\nOn the O&M side, and as we discussed throughout last year, we had a fast start to savings in the first quarter, but we reinvested that savings back into the business throughout the remainder of the year. That acceleration into last year has driven a higher run rate for O&M in the first quarter of 2022, but we see this as purely a timing-related variance. The bottom line is we fully expect to hit our average annual 1% to 2% O&M reduction over the 10-year plan. We continue to have confidence in our ability to drive further O&M efficiencies. One example is the meter program that Dave discussed. We piloted this program back in the first quarter of 2021. And as of April this year, we are now in full deployment mode for the meter program in Texas and anticipate productivity improvements for the remainder of this year.\nWe are also reaffirming our full year 2022 guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38 of non-GAAP EPS, which reflects 8% growth over the comparable $1.27 non-GAAP EPS results for 2021. We expect that our earnings ratio will be somewhat back-end loaded as some of our recovery mechanisms are skewed towards the latter half of the year such as our DCRF filing, which I'll discuss shortly. The actions we have taken to simplify our story are illustrated on this page. We expect to have a simpler, more digestible investor story going forward.\nBeyond 2022, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS 8% each year through 2024 and at the mid to high point of 6% to 8% annually through 2030. Our focus is to deliver strong growth each and every year.\nTurning to Slide 6. Dave covered a lot of the customer-driven capital investment opportunities we have ahead of us. As he said, we are in year 2 of a very attainable and tangible capital investment plan of $40 billion plus through 2030, which you can see here on this page. These projects are focused on safety, resiliency, reliability, growth and clean enablement. One item to discuss on the clean energy side, recognizing there is a lot of conversation regarding the availability of imported solar panels.\nWhile we're not immune to the current market factors, our next facility is not slated to come into service until the fourth quarter of 2023, and a lot can and will happen between now and then. We are working with our developers and suppliers and feel good about their early attention towards identifying possible alternatives if needed. We will obviously be learning more over the coming weeks and months, but we remain firmly committed to our long-term renewable generation transition and our time line for our net zero and carbon reduction emission goals will remain unchanged.\nIt is important to note that while we are only anticipating less than $0.02 of earnings benefit in 2024 from the generation transition, we have pulled forward some other capital work into 2022 for the latter part of the plan to reduce the risk and to continue to invest for the benefit of our customers. As a result of this acceleration, we are now forecasting to spend $4.3 billion in capital expenditures during 2022 and have increased our 5-year capital expenditure forecast to $19.3 billion from $19.2 billion. This is our second increase to the plan since Analyst Day.\nWe are also fortunate to have regulatory mechanisms that allow for timely recovery of our capital investment. About 80% of the 10-year capital plan is eligible for recovery and expected to be recovered through interim capital recovery mechanisms, an example of which includes our recent distribution cost recovery factor or DCRF rate, which is expected to go into effect September 1 this year. This is a filing for Houston Electric to recover $1.6 billion in distribution capital we have made since 2018. These investments were dedicated to system improvements, load growth, intelligent grid projects and temporary emergency mobile generation. Our continued focus on cost controls and other items should help mitigate the bill impact for our customers.\nAs is often the case with including something new like mobile generation and an existing mechanism, there is more regulatory scrutiny than usual around this year's DCRF, which includes the first tranche of our mobile generation investment. We look forward to working constructively with stakeholders to resolve the rate application on a time line consistent with the DCRF statute.\nIn our Minnesota gas jurisdiction, we recently filed a constructive rate case settlement with all intervening parties specifying a rate of return on equity of 9.39% and resulting in an annual revenue requirement increase of $48.5 million. The settlement is subject to Minnesota PUC review, and the anticipated approval is expected in the third quarter of 2022. That rate case application used a forward test year providing timely recovery of our forecasted capital investments in reliability and safety across our system for the benefit of our customers as well as our first green hydrogen pilot project, which recently went into service. We are excited to now have the green hydrogen production facility online, which will use about 1 megawatt of renewable generation to produce hydrogen, which is then mixed into our natural gas system. While this is a small pilot project, it's a step in the right direction as we, our customers and our regulators progress towards a better understanding of how hydrogen can fit into our long-term broader carbon emission reduction goals. Additional green hydrogen and other renewable gas projects will be considered in future natural gas innovation act filings, which we plan to submit later this year.\nTurning towards a broader regulatory update. We have securitization efforts going on in a couple of jurisdictions, which I'll provide an update on. This mechanism allows for a recovery of certain costs while once again lessening the impact to our customers by recovering over a longer period of time. The funds received from securitization can also be redeployed into capital investments for another form of efficient funding. Lastly, from a credit perspective, the rating agencies typically remove the securitization bonds and cash flows from the credit metric calculations.\nIn the state of Texas, we still anticipate the statewide securitization bonds to be issued in the coming months as the Texas public financing authority is currently in their RFP process. We expect that this will provide a 100% recovery of the $1.1 billion of gas costs incurred during last year's winter storm as well as the carrying costs.\nIn Indiana and in the coming weeks, we anticipate filing for costs related to the retirement of 2 coal facilities. This is a first-of-its-kind filing in Indiana. The current procedural schedule anticipates a decision by the end of 2022. And if the financing order is approved, we would expect a bond issuance in the first quarter of 2023. Outside of these updates on securitization, I'll remind everyone on the regulatory side, we have limited regulatory risks near term with no major rate cases until late 2023.\nTurning to strategic transactions, we sold our remaining 51 million energy transfer common units of preferred units this quarter for approximately $700 million of combined net proceeds or roughly $490 million net of taxes. Along with the 2021 sales, we received approximately $1.3 billion net after tax, which is a 20% premium to the energy transfer unit price when the transaction was announced. Additionally, in January, we received Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC transaction proceeds of $1.6 billion net of taxes including approximately $400 million for the remaining outstanding incremental gas costs. We have now utilized $1.8 billion of the combined LDC and Energy Transfer proceeds to reduce debt including the $1.2 billion discussed on last quarter's call as well as paying down CenterPoint parent level debt, including $600 million of high coupon senior notes this quarter.\nThese actions are also in line with our goal to reduce parent-level debt to approximately 20% of total debt by the end of this year, a goal we are well on our way towards achieving.\nWe plan to use the remaining proceeds to fund the equity portion of our industry-leading rate base growth without external equity issuances. Separately and as we discussed at our Analyst Day and throughout last year, we have had an ongoing evaluation of our repairs expense deduction methodology, which will be another way for us to mitigate our cash tax position, efficiently funding our growth and helping offset customer bills. We currently expect that this process will result in a onetime cash tax benefit of approximately $300 million in 2022, and at least an incremental $25 million annually in future years, which over the 5-year period would equate to at least $400 million of capital that we can redeploy into our business for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders. This is approximately $50 million more than what we estimated at our Analyst Day update and is yet another example of efficiently funding our industry-leading growth plan.\nOur long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% to 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. Additionally, let me remind you, Moody's recently revised our downgrade threshold of 13%, noting our improved business risk profile. And to be clear, we're continuing to focus on retaining this incremental credit cushion as opposed to using it to fund our growth. We believe that these improvements in our balance sheet, coupled with our efficient recycling of capital, put us in a position of being able to offer industry-leading growth without the need for external equity. As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously, and we realized our obligation to optimize stakeholder value for all.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason. As you heard from us today, we now have 8 straight quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations and have checked the box on executing on our strategic transactions. We are a pure regulated utility and firmly on the pathway to premium with incremental growth opportunities driven by our customer demands.\n\nJackie Richert\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. We'll now turn to Q&A, and we'll be cognizant of the busy calendar call schedule following us. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to [Jackie Rickard], Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Rickard?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to CenterPoint's earnings conference call. Dave Lesar, our CEO; and Jason Wells, our CFO, will discuss the company's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon various factors, as noted in our Form 10-K, other SEC filings and our earnings materials. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement.\nWe will be discussing non-GAAP measures on today's call. This will be the last quarter in which we will discuss Utility EPS, which is a non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance measure. Utility EPS excludes earnings from midstream, among other exclusions when providing guidance for 2022, and we will use the non-GAAP EPS measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis referred to as non-GAAP EPS. Jason Wells will provide further details. For information on our guidance methodology and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to our earnings news release and presentation, both of which can be found under the Investors section on our website.\nAs a reminder, we may use the website to announce material information. This call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jackie. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. As we wrap up a very busy 2021 at CenterPoint, I'll run through our annual highlights and headlines. To say the least, it's been quite a year. First, we continue to build on our consistent track record of earnings delivery, with now 7 straight quarters of execution by the current management team.\nWe raised our utility EPS guidance 3 times throughout 2021, and then delivered on that guidance, reporting $1.27 on a full year basis, an industry-leading 8.5% increase as compared to 2020. And as we discussed, we continue to grow our dividend in line with EPS growth, and accelerated the increase in that dividend in Q4 of 2021. This growth is supported by our underlying rate base growing at 11% year-over-year. In 2021, we also saw a continued 2% customer growth for electric, and 1% for natural gas.\nAnd as we have said before, this organic growth is a luxury, many other utilities just do not have. And even after pulling over $25 million of O&M spending opportunities forward from 2022 to into 2021, we achieved a 1% decrease in our controllable O&M, and we're sticking with our plan to have annual average reductions of 1% to 2% in O&M over the course of our 10-year plan. We also listened to our shareholders regarding 2 key action items in 2021, and executed on both of them. First, we enhanced our Board governance structure, eliminated the Executive Chair position and established an Independent Board Chair. And secondly, made substantial progress toward exiting midstream altogether with the completion of the Enable Energy Transfer merger and the sale of 70% of our interest in Energy Transfer in 2021.\nWith the exit of our interest in Enable, we became more focused on being a pure-play regulated utility. We then became even more weighted toward electric with the sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDC businesses earlier this year. With the sale of these gas LDC businesses, we are now over 60% electric in our rate base. This electric versus gas business mix now puts us within the range of some of our premium utility peers.\nWe also unveiled our new ESG strategy in 2021. Our goal to transition to net-zero on direct emissions by 2035 was particularly well received. This effort has already resulted in a significant ratings improvement by [Sustainalytics] for CenterPoint. I am pleased to say that we are now rated in the top quartile of the utilities industry, nearly 30% better than the average utility, a result that will only improve as we execute on our generation transition plan and other ESG initiatives.\nAs stated, we reported $1.27 for full year 2021 Utility EPS, which is an 8.5% increase over 2020. This was an industry-leading outcome. Today, we are also reaffirming guidance for 2022 at $1.36 to $1.38 for non-GAAP EPS, with the midpoint of this range being 8% growth. And of course, for this year, and through 2024, we are still targeting an industry-leading 8% annual non-GAAP EPS growth each and every year. Let me be clear on 1 thing, though. We don't need the benefit of nor are we counting on the remaining energy transfer units to achieve this 8% non-GAAP EPS growth. And to reinforce this, we plan to exclude the midstream activity from our non-GAAP results in 2022, and Jason will cover more on this in a moment.\nI strongly believe CenterPoint has the right management team in place to execute on our strategy. I and the Board continue to have regular dialogue on management succession, how to best develop, cross-train and retain the top talent that we have here at CenterPoint. I feel that CenterPoint leadership is among the best in the industry.\nLet's move on to capital investments. Let me summarize our current capital spending plans, and Jason will then provide more details. First, we executed our 2021 capital plan. We said we would catch up on our 2021 capital spend in the fourth quarter, and we did. To benefit our customers, we invested $3.6 billion in 2021 to support growth, resiliency and safety across our system. This included an incremental $100 million above the capital spend we communicated to you on our last Analyst Day. Overall, as detailed in our September Analyst Day, we anticipated capital spending of $18 billion plus over the next 5 years and a $40 billion plus over the next 10 years. The 5-year $18 billion-plus plan from Analyst Day included up to $1 billion for the additional tools we were provided by the Texas legislature coming out of winter storm Uri.\nIn addition to the incremental $100 million of capital we spent in 2021, so far to date in 2022, we have also been able to accelerate an additional $200 million of capital spend from the 2023 capital spending plan. This has now increased our 2022 capital plan to $4 billion, up from $3.8 billion. And more importantly, we have already identified the $200 million of additional capital opportunities required to fill the capacity created by this acceleration of spend from 2023. This now increases our total capital spend for the 5-year plan from $18 billion plus to $19.2 billion. This ability to identify and spend incremental capital in 2021, identify and accelerate capital spend into 2022 from 2023, and then identify the capital to backfill 2023 capital spend with even more spending opportunities is a really great outcome.\nIncluded in the accelerated spend are the capital leases for 500 megawatts of mobile generation capacity. This fleet is deployed across our Greater Houston area electric footprint. Mobile generation has become an important part of our overall resiliency strategy, and Texas Governor, Abbott, has also recently highlighted the importance of these tools as part of his plan to combat severe weather events. In fact, these mobile backup generation assets were strategically deployed across our service territory. And in working with ERCOT, we're ready to be energized in case of a load shed request during the recent winter storm Landon.\nAs Jason will explain, we expect to begin recovery of these costs in our DCRF filings in 2022 and 2023. We highlighted the growth of Houston in our recent Analyst Day. And 2 weeks ago, the city of Houston and CenterPoint jointly launched the first of its kind, long-term strategic power resilience initiative called Resilient Now. As part of this effort, we are working with the city of Houston to develop a master energy plan, which will identify the future capital opportunities to help the community handle its continued economic growth, help meet the challenges of more frequent and destructive weather events, support the buildout of its EV infrastructure and advance its environmental goals. This will include grid and infrastructure hardening and modernization, residential weatherization and investments around renewable energy infrastructure. We are now working with other cities within our electric footprint for similar initiatives as well. We will keep you updated on the development of these opportunities in the initiatives in the coming quarters.\nAs you may remember, I recently assigned Jason Wells, the additional responsibility of managing our Indiana generation transition efforts. So he will cover that in a few minutes. And while he's at it, I'll also have you and provide a regulatory update as well. So in summary, we've had 7 consecutive quarters of improved performance, and are now executing against the strategy we laid out in our September Analyst Day. In 2021, we achieved industry-leading 8.5% utility EPS growth and grew our rate base at 11%. We have recently executed 2 large strategic transactions and are continuing to find ways to increase our $40 billion-plus and capital investments over the course of our 10-year plan, all to benefit our customers and our investors.\nAnd lastly, we have listened to you. And as you will hear from Jason, we are simplifying our earnings reporting structure going forward. And as you can tell, we moved our earnings call date earlier into the reporting season.\n2021 was a great year for CenterPoint with quarter-after-quarter of meeting or exceeding expectations. I firmly believe we are becoming a premium utility, and will consistently extend our track record of delivering on our strategy. Looking ahead, I'll reiterate that we plan to grow our non-GAAP EPS at 8% year-over-year through 2024, with no help from the midstream. In the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual range thereafter through our 10-year plan. We intend to invest $40 billion plus in capital to support growth, resiliency and clean enablement for the benefit of our customers, and we'll look to accelerate investments where appropriate.\nAnd lastly, we remain focused on achieving our value proposition, which is sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers, and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason P. Wells\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter call. As Dave mentioned, and hopefully some of you have noticed, we moved this call a couple of days earlier in the reporting calendar. We heard your feedback last year and are committed to continuing to advance our reporting date over the course of this year and next. Also, with the sale of 70% of our interest in Energy Transfer, and resulting in elimination of separately reporting midstream results, we are now able to simplify our reporting, and focus solely on non-GAAP EPS in 2022 and beyond. This is another important step in further simplifying our story.\nTurning to our financial results. On a GAAP EPS basis, as shown on Slide 5, we reported $1.01 for the fourth quarter of 2021 and $2.28 on a full year basis. This includes a net after-tax gain of approximately $550 million from the merger of Enable and Energy Transfer, partially offset by losses on the sale of Energy Transfer Securities.\nLooking at Slide 6, we reported $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $0.29 for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP EPS was comprised of $0.27 from Utility and another $0.09 Midstream in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Utility EPS results included favorable growth in rate recovery, contributing $0.04 this quarter while weather, usage and other added another $0.01 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe are also reaffirming our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38 of non-GAAP EPS for 2022, which reflects 8% growth over the $1.27 Utility EPS results for 2021. As Dave mentioned, achieving our 8% growth is not contingent on any benefit from the remaining Energy Transfer Securities we own. For 2022, we plan to exclude, among others, all impacts associated with our Energy Transfer interests as well as all impacts associated with our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDC sales, and the ongoing mark-to-market on our Zen Securities from our non-GAAP results.\nBeyond 2022, we continue to expect to grow non-GAAP EPS 8% each year through 2024, and then at the mid to high point of 6% to 8% each year through 2030. Our focus is delivering strong growth each and every year.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our capital expenditures for 2021 were $3.6 billion, inclusive of the mobile generation long-term leases, which is approximately $100 million more than what we indicated at our September Analyst Day. I want to spend a moment describing the investment in mobile generation and resulting update to our forecast. This investment gives us an important tool that is in place currently to help mitigate the risk of extended outages for our customers in Texas. In the event, we're asked a shed load by the ERCOT market or in response to certain other widespread power outages. We procured 500 megawatts of mobile generation valued at approximately $700 million of capital spread across 2021 and 2022, which was previously in our Analyst Day capital plans for $600 million spread across 2021, 2022 and 2023. The increase in cost and acceleration of the investment over our previous plan shared at Analyst Day result in the following. First, it contributed to approximately $100 million more in capital in 2021. Second, the acceleration will result in an increase of $200 million of capital in 2022. As a result, we are increasing our 2022 capital expenditure guidance to $4 billion and increasing our year-end 2022 rate base guidance by $300 million to $20 billion. And finally, we have already identified $200 million of incremental capital to replace the capacity in 2023, created by the acceleration of the mobile generation investment. Overall, this results in a $300 million increase in our 5-year capital expenditure plan, which is now expected to be $19.2 billion. Approximately $200 million of this mobile generation investment will be included in the upcoming Distribution Capital Recovery Tracker, or DCRF filing, planned in 2022, with the remaining $500 million balance expected to be included in our 2023 DCRF filing. That means, from an earnings standpoint, we expect the entire mobile generation capital will be included in rates and earning a return on equity September 2023. As a reminder, we will not be eligible to earn an equity return on this investment until the amounts are included in rates. Overall, this is a great example of the State of Texas providing additional tools to help mitigate the risk of an extended outage, and our team moving quickly to implement these changes for the benefits of our customers and our shareholders.\nTurning to the Indiana transition plans for a moment. As Dave mentioned, we still continue to work with stakeholders in Indiana for the successful transition from coal generation. We recently completed hearings on our proposed simple cycle gas plant and anticipate the associated decision in the third quarter of this year. We also recently reduced the size of our initial solar project on (inaudible) County from 300 megawatts to 200 megawatts as a response to the recent materials cost increases and community feedback, and we'll be going back to the commission for approval of this modification later in early second quarter. We anticipate filing the certificates of public convenience and necessity for the remaining solar and wind build transfer projects during the second and third quarters, respectively. Overall, we continue to work towards a goal of owning our renewable generation needs contracting for the remaining 50% through power purchase agreements and owning the simple cycle gas plant for reliability purposes. This progress on our renewable generation transition is a key driver in achieving our industry-leading net-zero direct emission school by 2035. We are further demonstrating our alignment to our net-zero goal by adding an emission reduction component to our long-term employee incentive compensation program this year.\nAnd as Dave mentioned, we've recently received a positive update on our ESG rating score from Sustainalytics that now places us in the top quartile of the utility industry. We are very proud of the enhancements we've made towards our environmental, social and governance commitments, and we look forward to continued progress.\nNow I want to provide a broader update on our regulatory progress. We are going through a full rate case in Minnesota, and are optimistic that we will reach a settlement before our April evidentiary hearing. Additionally, all of the gas utilities in Minnesota have a separate docket outstanding for the prudency of incremental gas costs resulting from last year's winter store. This is our only jurisdiction with an open prudency review.\nTurning to the State of Texas. The Railroad Commission issued a financing order for the statewide securitization bonds. We expect that this will provide a 100% recovery of the $1.1 billion gas costs incurred during last year's winter storm as well as carrying costs with the recovery spread over a longer time period to minimize bill impact for our customers. These bonds are expected to be issued before mid-2022.\nNow turning to strategic transactions. As Dave mentioned, we are very proud of the effort of our employees for completing 2 major strategic transactions that position us as a purely regulated utility while recycling capital to efficiently fund our industry-leading growth. The closure of the Enable transaction in December is a great example of what the current Centerpoint team is capable of. After closing the transaction, we completed the sales of a portion of our energy transfer securities. And inclusive of the previously announced forward sale of common units, we have now sold approximately 70% of our interests in Energy Transfer, which includes half of the Energy Transfer Series G preferred units at 150 million common units for nearly $800 million of net after-tax proceeds, which were used to pay down parent-level debt. We expect that our remaining Energy Transfer position of 51 million common units and approximately $190 million of Series G preferred units will be sold well before our target timing of year-end 2022.\nTurning to the Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC transaction, which closed in January. We received over $1.6 billion of net after-tax proceeds, including approximately $400 million related to the remaining outstanding incremental gas costs. A portion of those proceeds were used to pay down $300 million of CERC level debt to rightsize our capital structure, and another $425 million of floating rate notes associated with the incremental gas costs from last year's winter storm. We plan to use the remaining proceeds to efficiently fund our industry-leading rate base growth.\nAt the CenterPoint parent level, we also paid down $500 million of CenterPoint senior notes, and reduced our commercial paper balance. These actions are in line with our goal to reduce parent-level debt to approximately 20% by year-end 2022. Our current liquidity remains strong at $2.9 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. In addition to the previously mentioned debt paydown associated with strategic transactions, we now have the order in place for the state-level securitization in Texas to recover our remaining $1.1 billion of gas costs from last year's winner storm. We plan to use the proceeds from the securitization to pay off the remaining balance of our floating rate short-term notes, and a portion of the fixed rate notes due September 2023. Our long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology, and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies.\nNow with the statewide securitization in place, Moody's has revised CERC's outlook to stable. This now means that all of our rated entities have a stable outlook with all 3 agencies, underlying is significant credit supportive actions we have taken over the past 1.5 years. With the near-complete exit of midstream, we continue to engage with the agencies on our improved business risk profile and advocate for a lower downgrade threshold. We believe that these improvements in the balance sheet, coupled with our efficient recycling of capital, put us in the position of being able to offer industry-leading growth without the need for external equity. As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously, and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value.\nAnd with that, we look forward to more of these shorter earnings calls in the future. I'll turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid John Lesar\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason. As you heard from us today, we've had 7 quarters of meeting or exceeding expectations, and have checked the box on executing under strategic transactions. We are nearly a pure-play regulated utility, and we are demonstrating the pathway to a premium.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Dave. We're now ready to turn the call over to Q&A."

Welcome to Lowe's Companies' Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President of Merchandising, Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President of Stores, and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2025. Actual results, may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A, and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Third quarter sales were $20.8 billion, with comparable sales, increasing 0.4%, year over year, despite a roughly 100 basis point, headwind related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. During the quarter, adjusted operating margin, expanded approximately 10 basis points, leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.06, which is an increase of 6%, versus last year. These results reflect continued operational discipline and strong execution across our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, initiatives. Although sales results continue to be impacted by softer demand within an uncertain macro environment, we're encouraged to see improvement in DIY customer engagement and discretionary projects across many areas of the home. We're also pleased with our performance in the north and west divisions, which were not affected by storms in the prior year.\nWe're seeing strength across all five key initiatives, within our 2025 Total Home Strategy, which we launched at our Analysts and Investor Conference last year. Let me give you an update on the performance of our Total Home Strategy, beginning with the small to medium pro, where we once again delivered growth this quarter. We're enhancing our pro offering through our Pro Extended Aisle, which is a direct interface with our supplier systems. It allows our pro sales associates, to sell directly from their product catalogs, with the suppliers opting for filling the orders directly to the job site. This expands our product assortment, inventory quantities, and delivery capabilities for larger orders. Second, when it comes to accelerating online sales, we delivered online sales growth, of 11.4%, this quarter, driven by increased traffic and continued strong conversion.\nWe're also continuing to enhance the online experience across Lowes.com and our mobile app, to make it simpler and faster for DIY and pro customers, to find all the products they need. Looking ahead, we're pleased with the ongoing build-out of our marketplace. This allows us to expand our product assortment to offer our customers everything they need for their homes across the price spectrum, from value to premium, without assuming the risk of owning the inventory. Third, we're leveraging our loyalty ecosystem, to increase our customer preferences for Lowe's, so they choose us first and shop more often. In fact, our 30 million MyLowe's Rewards members shop, twice as often and spend over 50%, more than non-members. Through both our DIY and pro loyalty programs, we're gaining deeper customer insights, which help us tailor more personalized, value-enhancing offers, through data-driven marketing.\nFourth, we're really pleased with the strong results this quarter in home services, where we delivered double-digit comps. Later in the call, Joe, will discuss the initiatives that are driving these gains. The fifth and final initiative, in our total home strategy, is increasing space productivity. We made great progress optimizing our selling space, and Bill, will provide details on a couple of key initiatives later in the call. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress that we have delivered through our total home strategy, and the strategic alignment we're driving across the organization. Let me now discuss the importance of generative AI to improve how we sell, how we shop, and how we work. This is what we refer to as our AI framework. As we continue to make strategic investments, in our AI capabilities, we're already seeing tangible results.\nOur virtual assistants, Milo and Milo Companion, which are built on an OpenAI platform, are answering nearly 1 million questions per month about everything from product specs, to project know-how, to the status of a customer order. In fact, when our customers engage with Milo online, the conversion rate more than doubles, which is clear evidence that AI is simplifying decision-making and driving sales. When our associates use Milo Companion, to help customers shopping in our stores, we're seeing customer satisfaction scores increase 200 basis points. Every interaction with our virtual assistant, is feeding our proprietary models, allowing us to continually improve accuracy and build a durable advantage in home improvement expertise. Within our technology team, engineers are using AI tools, for development and code review, leading to double-digit productivity gains, and accelerating our speed to market.\nIn fact, Lowe's, has just been recognized by OpenAI, with their 100 billion token milestone award, as a reflection of the depth and breadth of AI adoption throughout the organization. Achieving this milestone places Lowe's, in an elite tier of companies that are not just experimenting with AI, but operating at a true enterprise scale. Looking ahead, we have a detailed roadmap of several additional high-impact AI initiatives, that will drive further enhancements to the pro and DIY customer experience, both in store and online. This will include our participation in a Genetic Commerce, so we can continue to meet our customers where and how they choose to shop. We also anticipate incremental productivity gains as we leverage AI to drive operating efficiency, across the enterprise. Now, let me turn to our acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, or FBM, which we completed in October.\nI'd like to begin by extending a warm welcome to the entire FBM team. As a reminder, FBM, is a leading distributor in interior building products, including drywall, metal framing, insulation, and ceiling systems. FBM's business mixes, balance evenly between commercial and residential. While the housing market, is currently under some pressure, we're pleased with the momentum we're seeing with FBM's commercial sales. Some recent highlights include several data center projects, a luxury 150-unit residential high-rise, and medical facilities. FBM leverages, its strong reputation for reliability and technical expertise to win these contracts. When we consider the impact to Lowe's, this acquisition gives us a more comprehensive product portfolio, expands our revenue streams, and further enhances our offering to our pro customers. In fact, efforts are already underway to quickly connect FBM's product catalog, to our Pro Extended Aisle.\nFBM customers, will gain access to Lowe's complementary products like tools, safety gear, and fasteners, so they can more quickly and conveniently source everything they need for their jobs. FBM's, 370 locations nationwide also strengthen our fulfillment capabilities, especially in high-density urban markets in California, the Northeast, and the Midwest, where Lowe's has less of a physical store presence. Our acquisition of FBM and Artisan Design Group, or ADG, creates comprehensive interior solutions for our home builders, with everything from drywall and insulation to doors, flooring, cabinets, and appliances. I look forward to updating you on the progress we're making with both acquisitions in the future. Now, let me transition to our view of the macro environment. Overall, the U.S. homeowner remains healthy. Balance sheets are strong, and consumers continue to spend.\nHowever, affordability and uncertainty in the broader economy continue to weigh on consumer confidence, particularly when it comes to larger discretionary purchases, as borrowing costs have been elevated for longer than originally anticipated. Looking ahead, lower interest rates, including for home equity loans, could begin to spur demand, even as many homeowners remain reluctant to move and give up their historically low mortgage rates. This cycle, is different from past housing slowdowns in a few important ways. First, homeowners today have record levels of equity, roughly $400,000 on average. At the same time, they're more likely to invest in the home they already own instead of giving up the low mortgage rate. This is referred to as the lock-in effect and could make home equity financing, a more attractive solution.\nWhile the near-term macro backdrop, reflects an anxious consumer, the combination of strong fundamentals, substantial home equity, and the potential for lower rates, ahead gives us confidence in the long-term health of the home improvement sector. We remain confident that the continued execution of our Total Home Strategy, will position Lowe's, to win in the short and in the long term. Before I close, I'd like to wish all of our associates a blessed and safe holiday season. Our associates are our competitive advantage, and I appreciate all they do to make Lowe's a great company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning. This quarter, we delivered positive comps in 10 of our 14 merchandise divisions, and solid performance across both DIY and pro, despite lapping hurricane activity last year. Starting with home decor, we delivered positive comps in appliances, flooring, paint, and kitchens and bath. We continue to strengthen our leadership position, in appliances by providing customers with a value proposition, that no other retailer in the industry can match. This includes the widest assortment of top brands and innovative products, all at a must-win price point. By leveraging our market delivery network, we're the only retailer who can deliver and install major appliances, in virtually every zip code in the U.S. next day. This capability is crucial for items like refrigerators or washing machines that often need to be replaced immediately.\nOne example of our innovative product offering is an exclusive new Bosch, hybrid tub dishwasher line, available only at Lowe's. These models combine the quiet operation Bosch, is known for, along with the durability of stainless steel and the affordability of polymer. The result is a better, cleaner, and a better value with the most accessible price points in the industry. Turning to flooring, we saw broad-based strength across soft surfaces, vinyl, and tile flooring. In carpet, customers are enthusiastic about the benefits of StainMaster Pet Protect. Its leak defense backing helps prevent spills and pet accidents from seeping into the carpet pad or subfloor. StainMaster, is the most trusted brand in carpet, and it is exclusive to Lowe's. Touching on paint, we drove broad-based growth across stains, primers, and paint, along with accessories and applicators.\nWe're excited to announce the launch of Sherwin-Williams Pro Block Quick Dry Primer, an innovative product that blocks stains, provides outstanding coverage, and dries in less than an hour. This new primer is available only at Lowe's and Sherwin-Williams locations, marking the first time that we have co-launched a product. This product provides Lowe's, with true differentiation within the home center channel as we continue to build on our strong relationship with this key supplier. Lastly, in kitchens and bath, we recently completed a reset of our bathroom vanity showrooms, and these new sets are delivering results ahead of our expectations. The updated showroom, provides a much better shopping experience for both pro and DIY customers, because they can now see and interact with a larger number of products, and the stock products, are now much more accessible and readily available for quick take with.\nThis is an important way we're driving space productivity and leveraging our larger stores as a competitive advantage. Turning now to building products, we drove positive comps across millwork, rough plumbing, lumber, and electrical. We're supplementing our already robust in-store pro offering in building products with our Pro Extended Aisle. As Marvin mentioned, this initiative expands our product offering, increases our inventory depth, and enhances our delivery capabilities. In millwork and rough plumbing, we've seen strong performance driven by higher installation sales in home services, which Joe will discuss shortly. Millwork, is another area where we're seeing innovation, like the Larsen, 60 MT Storm Door, with magnetic technology, that keeps the door closed. It offers both performance and curb appeal, and it gives customers a reason to upgrade. Turning to hard lines, we delivered positive comps in lawn and garden, with particular strength in live goods and hardscapes.\nCustomers were inspired by the outdoor vignettes that showcased everything they needed to build their vertical gardens, along with upgrading a mailbox display and more. The mild weather gave customers more opportunities to tackle more outdoor projects, which helped drive extended demand. We're also pleased with a strong start to the holiday season in our tools, trimmetry, and decor categories. Shifting gears to tools, where we also delivered positive comps, we saw strong performance in hand tools and tool storage. Customers responded to our value offerings and improved assortments like the Kobalt, 46-inch workstation, available in a wide range of colors. During the quarter, we leaned into value and drove strong online engagement during our DeWalt Days event, supported by a homepage takeover and a compelling free tools battery offer.\nNow, let me give you an update on one of our key Total Home Strategy initiatives, increasing space productivity, which is all about driving incremental sales opportunities, by optimizing our sales footprint. This quarter, we completed the rollout of our rural format in 150 additional stores, bringing the total to nearly 500. We're also on track to complete rollouts of workwear and pet to more than 1,000 stores, giving us an opportunity to drive these assortments beyond our rural stores. In line with our pet expansion, which is focused on grab-and-go items like toys and treats, we're pleased to announce our new private brand, Heart & Herd. It offers pet owners high-quality, value-priced products, for dogs and cats, just in time for holiday gifting. As part of our space productivity efforts, we've made significant progress on our SKU rationalization initiative, designed to improve our inventory productivity.\nBy the end of 2025, we're set to achieve our multi-year goal of reducing our in-store SKU count, by 15%. As we head into the holiday season, we're delivering new, exciting products both in-store and online, through our Black Friday build-up event. We're giving customers an early start on their holiday shopping with great deals, including several that are already available now. In closing, I'd like to thank our merchants, inventory, and supply chain teams, along with our MST associates, and our supplier partners, for their continued efforts to deliver results for our customers ahead of the busy holiday season. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP, Stores, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by recognizing our store and supply chain associates who show up every day with energy and commitment to serve our customers. Quarter after quarter, through changes and challenges, they've proven themselves to be our company's greatest asset. That's why I'm particularly pleased to share that the investments we're making to support our frontline associates are truly paying off. New training programs, are better equipping our store teams to sell complete customer projects, including featured seasonal products and services. By enabling our associates, to deliver more comprehensive solutions, these programs, are boosting their knowledge, confidence, and effectiveness at driving sales. As Marvin mentioned, they can also rely on our AI-powered Milo Companion, for product details and for help answering customers' questions.\nAdd it all up, and we're empowering our associates, with the tools they need to sell more effectively across all departments in the store. Additionally, a few weeks ago, we concluded our associate annual engagement survey, a critical component of our proactive listening strategy, which supports our efforts to become the employer of choice in retail. Scores, across the key measures of engagement and associate well-being, as well as leadership effectiveness, have all continued to improve, and our 95% participation rate, continues to be industry-leading. All told, our better-trained and highly engaged associates, are elevating the Lowe's shopping experience, which is reflected in improved customer satisfaction scores for both the DIY and pro.\nTo focus now on the pro, enrollments in our MyLowe's Pro Rewards program, continue to grow as our core small to medium pro customers, experience firsthand the benefits of our easier-to-use loyalty platform, which allows them to start earning rewards immediately and achieve higher rewards with lower levels of spending. We're also pleased to see pros taking advantage of our enhanced digital capabilities, as they shift to more shopping online. Looking ahead, we're encouraged that our recent pro survey overall sentiment improved for small to medium pros as they remain confident in their job prospects and report stable backlogs. Shifting now to performance in home services this quarter, we're pleased with our double-digit growth in this key initiative within our Total Home Strategy. The team delivered broad-based strength across a number of product categories, including windows and doors, HVAC, water heaters, kitchens and bath, and window treatments.\nThese strong results were driven in part by tech-enabled solutions, which have enhanced the experience of customers, installers, and associates alike. For our customers, we've accelerated the process from inquiry to completed installation by providing intuitive solutions for scheduling, quoting, and payment. These enhancements have transformed what was a time-consuming process by removing friction and pain points along the customer journey. Turning now to our focus on operating efficiency, I'd like to thank our asset protection teams for continuing to deliver one of the best inventory shrink results in big box retail. Despite the challenging environment, these results are driven by a combination of outstanding leadership and industry-leading technology. We also focused this year on a number of perpetual productivity improvements, or PPI, initiatives in our stores, including our front-end transformation, streamlining our BOPUS fulfillment, and the freight flow optimization.\nWe're already working on our PPI roadmap for 2026, for store operations as we leverage AI-enabled solutions, to further enhance the customer experience, while also driving labor productivity. Before I close, let me take a moment to discuss one of our new initiatives to support veterans as part of our long-standing commitment to the military community and in support of our objective to deliver 10 million sq ft, of impact in 2025. As a Marine, who served in combat, I'm particularly proud to share that in partnership with Building Homes for Heroes, and our hometown of Mooresville, North Carolina, we've just broken ground on Freedom Hill. This first-of-its-kind community will provide mortgage-free housing and support services for up to 15 households of injured veterans and first responders.\nAs the executive sponsor of Lowe's, philanthropic support of our military communities, it will be an honor for me to see lives changed through this initiative. With that, let me turn the call over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning. Starting with our third quarter results, we generated GAAP-diluted earnings per share, of $2.88. In the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, or FBM. We recognized $105 million, in pre-tax transaction costs, including the fees associated, with $9 billion, in bridge financing. To finance, the $8.8 billion, purchase price, we issued $5 billion, of bonds, with a competitive weighted average ,coupon of 4.38%, and borrowed $2 billion, under a three-year term loan. Given our better-than-expected cash flow generation, we financed, the remaining $1.8 billion, with cash on hand. We also recognized $24 million, in non-GAAP adjustments, associated with Artisan Design Group, or ADG. Keep in mind that in the third quarter, of last year, we recorded a pre-tax gain, of $54 million, associated with the 2022 sale, of our Canadian retail business.\nExcluding these impacts, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share, of $3.06, exceeding our expectations. This is a 6%, increase compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share, in the prior year quarter. My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons that exclude these impacts where applicable. Third quarter sales, were $20.8 billion, with comparable sales, up 0.4%, driven by DIY engagement, across project-related categories, as well as another quarter of growth in pro, online, and appliances. As Marvin mentioned, we also lapped storm-related demand, which was a roughly 100 basis point, headwind to sales this quarter. While we continue to manage through an uncertain macro environment, we are pleased that we delivered positive comps in 10 of 14 product categories. Monthly comps, were up 2.5%, in August, up 0.9%, in September, and down 2.6%, in October,, when storm-related demand was most concentrated last year.\nFor the quarter, comparable average ticket increased 3.4%, driven by ongoing strength in pro and appliances, mixed shift into larger ticket purchases, and modest price increases, while comparable transactions, declined 3%. Gross margin, was 34.2%, in the quarter, up 50 basis points, as we cycle a number of storm-related pressures in the prior year. We also saw improvements in credit revenue, and better sell-through of inventory as we drive our SKU rationalization efforts. Adjusted SG&A, was 19.6%, of sales, deleveraging 36 basis points, as we cycled lower bonus attainment in the prior year, and also invested in sales-driving actions. Adjusted operating margin rate, of 12.4%, was up 10 basis points, versus prior year, and the adjusted effective tax rate, of 24%, was in line with prior year results. Inventory, ended Q3 at $17.2 billion, down approximately $400 million, versus prior year.\nThis net decrease, also reflects the inclusion of inventory from recent acquisitions, of approximately $600 million, and higher tariffs. These results were driven by several inventory productivity initiatives, across the company as we leverage advanced AI inventory solutions, to enhance our demand planning, allocation, and replenishment, while also driving our SKU rationalization efforts. ADG operating results, were accretive to EPS, on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter, and pressured operating margin, by approximately 15 basis points, in line with expectations. Turning now to capital allocation. In Q3, we generated $687 million, in operating cash flow, inclusive of the payment of federal and state taxes, of roughly $900 million, that had been deferred under a provision related to Hurricane Helene. Capital expenditures totaled $597 million, as we continue to invest in our strategic growth imperatives. In the quarter, we paid $673 million, in dividends, at $1.20 per share.\nAdjusted debt to EBITDA, was 3.36x, at the end of the quarter, after we repaid $1.75 billion, in debt maturities and borrowed, $7 billion, to finance the acquisition, of FBM. The structure of this financing, in conjunction with the timing of our existing bond maturities, will allow for steady deleverage to our 2.75x target, which is expected by mid-2027. We ended the quarter with $621 million, of cash and cash equivalents, and delivered a return on invested capital of 26.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, which we are updating to include our year-to-date results and our expectations for FBM, we are seeing a cautious consumer amid ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment, and the timing of an inflection in the home improvement and housing markets remains unclear.\nWe're now expecting comp sales to be roughly flat for the year, which is at the bottom end of our previous guidance. When we include FBM sales, of approximately $1.3 billion, in the fourth quarter, we are expecting sales, of approximately $86 billion, for the year. We also now expect full-year adjusted operating margin, of approximately 12.1%, which includes 20 basis points, of dilution from FBM and ADG. We're expecting adjusted diluted earnings per share, of approximately $12.25, which represents 2% growth, over the prior year. Please note that this includes the impact of FBM, which is roughly neutral to adjusted EPS, and we expect capital expenditures, of up to $2.5 billion, for the year. On an annualized basis, we expect FBM and ADG, to negatively impact consolidated adjusted operating margin, by approximately 50 basis points.\nWe are already working collaboratively with the FBM and ADG teams, on cross-selling opportunities, as we expand the offering for our pro customers. We've also begun the efforts to extract cost synergies, from our overlapping areas of spend. Taken together, we remain confident that there are compelling long-term EBITDA synergies, from both revenue growth, and lower operating expense. These investments in our pro growth initiative, along with the other investments in our Total Home Strategy, will position us to capitalize on the expected recovery in housing and home improvement, and continue to deliver long-term sales growth and shareholder value. With that, we will open it up for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We're now ready for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press star two. In order to allow us questions from as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers, with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks and good morning. My first question is about just how you're thinking about the trend in the business in light of the performance that you've seen over the past six months and a harder compare, then into 2026. You noted that quarter-to-date is positive. Is there anything you could elaborate on that? Is the flat guide for the fourth quarter simply just like, hey, there's uncertainty and there's a harder compare?\nAs you think to 2026, if the home improvement market is flat to slightly down this year and you're putting up a flat comp, if you take a look at the sum total of everything, a little bit of lower rates, a little bit of replacement cycle, a little bit of innovation in what you're doing on the self-help side, should the market and should Lowe's, comp accelerate in 2026 relative to 2025?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey, Chris, this is Marvin. Bill and I, will talk about November, then we'll let Brandon, share a tiny bit about how we think about '26 because, as you can respect, we're not going to get into a ton of detail about that until our February call, where we'll provide guidance for the year. Relative to November, look, we're very pleased with the positive comp performance to start the quarter in spite of storm overlaps from last year. We've seen improvements in the top line since exiting October, and we just believe that some of the key elements of our total home strategy are working. We're excited about November, because there's some great things on tap.\nI'm going to let Bill, talk a bit about November, but also talk about appliances, which we think is really key to our performance, not only for the quarter, but what we're seeing in November.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Thanks, Marvin. Chris, we're excited about kind of the early start to the quarter, obviously, coming off of October. Strength for us is really broad-based across the store, with particular strength within our seasonal categories, holiday, trimmetry, tools, appliances, and other gift-related businesses that are getting off to an early start. Our stores look great. We're starting to see live trees show up now. Poinsettias, are showing up now as we get ready for next week. We're seeing some early excitement around some key areas of the store. Whether it's buy now and install by the holidays within our flooring and cooking areas, or you look at Kobalt, and some of the strength that we're seeing there with some new products in workstations, the buy-and-get offers within our tool business driven by DeWalt, Craftsman, Kobalt.\nWe've got just a lot of strength going on right now that we'll carry into next week with Black Friday. We're excited about how things are progressing. In our appliance business, we've had, really since last year, four straight quarters now of comp growth and unit growth, which is telling us the health of that business and that consumer responding to the offers, the innovation, and the new products that the team has put out there.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nChris, this is Brandon. I think when I step back and look at the totality of the year, we're now three quarters, of the way through, obviously navigating a lot of factors, a very choppy macro. When I look at just the trends of the business, I think a lot for us to be cautiously optimistic about as we look ahead to 2026. We're seeing acceleration on one-year comps when you exclude storm-related activity for Q3, and what's implied in our Q4. Also, two-year comps, accelerating nicely as we've moved through the year. Ongoing strength in pro online. Bill, just spoke to appliances. Some early signs of life in our home services business, which is really positive. We cited broad-based performance across categories, with 10 of 14 categories, geographies broad-based. Really excited about FBM and ADG, as we start the integration efforts.\nObviously, just really pleased with the bottom-line performance and the ongoing operational discipline that the company has been able to show. Pleased through three quarters, and as we look ahead into 2026, as Marvin mentioned, we'll have more to come in February, but those are early thoughts.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nOn a related question, I mean, kitchen and bath, I think you said it was positive. Looking back, it seems like you'd have to go all the way back to Q1, 2023. What's changed there? As you think about it, Marvin, you've talked about we have a lot of big ticket. We have a lot of remodel, the kitchen and bath, the appliances, and we sort of need lower rates to improve that sort of big-ticket remodel category. You are seeing signs of life. Is there sort of a misperception around how remodel-oriented you are amongst investors, or how do you think about maybe that category showing signs that it will inflect to the positive?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nChris, I think it's two things. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill, just talk about some of the work in resets and new products. I really believe that this is more about Lowe's,, taking share in this space. If you can go back to 2018 at our first analyst and investor conference, I presented how we were managing this install business with binders and whiteboards. It's taken us a while, candidly, to get this business digitized with a technology platform, that makes this entire process easy for the associate, the installer, and, most importantly, the customer. We think now we have a best-in-class tech stack for this space. We have central selling. What you're looking at outside of kitchen and bath, which Bill, will speak to, you're seeing categories like windows and doors, HVAC, and water heaters.\nThese are more replacement categories for customers who are living in the oldest housing stock in the history of the U.S. Because we have a better go-to-market strategy, Bill's team's, given us great pricing, Brandon's team's, given us a great credit portfolio. We're taking share in this area. We're also seeing, to your point, signs of life in areas that make us cautiously optimistic that maybe there are brighter days ahead. I'll let Bill, talk about some of those categories.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Chris, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that during the quarter, we had completed our vanity reset across the stores. That's one of the nice bright spots driving our kitchen and bath business. We're also seeing broad-based strength: toilets, bathing, faucets, disposal of kitchen sinks, bath repair. It's really kind of broad-based across the categories. We're excited about that. It really boils down to the strength I think we're also seeing within our central selling organization, where the store associates take the lead. We turn it over to our central selling team, and they're helping to close the deal on a kitchen cabinet. The strength of what Joe's team's, doing in the store to take good care of the customer.\nThere's just a lot of things that are adding up to the strength of the kitchen and bath business. Those are just a few highlights.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks so much. Have a great holiday.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Zach Fadem, with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nZachary Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments around improving pro survey sentiment. I'm curious if there's any extra color, you can talk through in terms of how that's trended through the year, to what extent you think this is a good leading indicator for your business. What do you think is driving the recent improvement?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nZach, thanks for the question. Just to hit it at a high level, our small to medium pro business, remains very stable. Roughly 75%, of our pros, are very confident in their job prospects. Also, this segment of the pro consumer, continues to work on smaller ticket repair, maintenance projects. That's been very consistent with what we've been saying all year long. When we look at our pros, when we talk to our pros, they feel very confident in their business. They feel confident in their access to credit and even feel a little bit more confident about their ability to hire and attract labor. We feel great about what our pros are telling us.\nLet me hand it over to Joe, to just talk about some of the things we're doing in the store to drive this continued growth and, in my opinion, market share gain with the specific customer segment.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP, Stores, Lowe's\n\nWell, Zach, thanks for the question. We're really pleased with the flywheel effect that we're seeing from the Transform Pro offering. When you think about where we've been headed with the loyalty through MyLowe's Pro Rewards, our relaunch there, we have just a wonderful, enhanced digital experience. Pro Extended Aisle, we have made investments in fulfillment. The last three years, our pro inventory investments are really beginning to pay off. The order modifications, the fulfillment flexibility, and the in-store experience. We're excited to see this flywheel effect all come together with the great product offerings that we have, and we have a good confidence that when this does bounce back, we're well-positioned to capture the share.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nIn fact, the only thing I'll add to that, I mentioned in my prepared comments that we're in the process of adding FBM to our Pro Extended Aisle platform. That's going to be a huge deal for us because it is very challenging for us today to fulfill a large order of something, let's say, drywall to a customer's job site and do it efficiently. We now are working to just transition that entire fulfillment process to a company that's best in class at it, and that's FBM. We think this is going to be great for FBM, it's going to be great for Lowe's, but more importantly, it's going to be great for the customer. Again, we see this as a sustainable growth strategy, and we feel great about the work we've done thus far.\n\nZachary Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate that. I know we aren't guiding for 2026 yet, but since the model is different with FBM and ADG, could we talk through early margin, scenarios in both a status quo environment as well as a scenario where perhaps we see some benefits from tax stimulus and lower rates?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Zach, I'll just hit briefly what we're looking at in terms of margins on the FBM and ADG transactions. When you look at 2025, taking in isolation, I mentioned in my remarks, we're roughly 20 basis points, on 2025. That's coming roughly split even, 10 from FBM and 10 ADG. When you look at as we wrap the year for 2026, that's going to be 50 basis points, on the year. Think 30 basis points, of wrap into 2026. The majority of that 50 basis points, when you think of 2026, is going to be weighted towards gross margin, on that. I'm not going to get into any more details as it relates to base business or run rate, but that's just some early views of geography and impact from the transactions in 2026.\n\nZachary Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks for the color.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Zach.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman, with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask to put the macro hat on again. There's a, I don't know if it's a bear case, but there's a housing scenario, that it just stays in this treading water position for longer. You have new prices, that are lower than existing homes, and the age, of homeowners is pushing close to 40 years old. I think affordability, is the issue. It sounds like you may reject that premise, Marvin, given some of the bright spots, but I wanted to hear how you react to it.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nNo, Simeon, it's a good question. I'll give you my thoughts, and I'll let Brandon, provide any additional comments. The way we see it is this. I think that mortgage rates, obviously are elevated longer than any of us anticipated. The one thing that's different, as I said in my prepared comments, is the fact that you have a healthy homeowner financially, and you have $33 trillion, in equity, that is in the system. We think anywhere between $11 to $13 trillion, of that is tappable. We think this lock-in effect, is real because at some point, customers are going to be looking at these sub-3% 30-year fixed mortgage rates. They like the neighborhood that they live in. They have excess equity, in their home. We think HELOCs, are going to become the next opportunity for us to drive discretionary remodel big-ticket projects.\nWe think that is a strong possibility in the future. Now, we're not going to try to time it. We're not going to try to build it in our forecast. I think that would be reckless. We do think that that is a very plausible hypothesis, that takes you away from the bear case. I'll pass it on to Brandon, to see if he has any other thoughts.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSimeon, I'll add, as Marvin mentioned, the mortgage rates, we're looking at those remaining elevated, at least as of now, 6% to 6.5%, tied more to the longer-term yields. That's continuing to pressure both existing home sales, and new home starts. I think as we start to look ahead into 2026, we're not anticipating meaningful near-term improvement there. We are potentially excited about what could happen with the funding coming from home equity. We've seen 150 basis points, of rate cuts from the Fed, here over the last 18 months. The consensus would suggest we're going to see more. We've seen these HELOC rates, go from a neighborhood of 10% to 12%, down to 8% to 10%. That's creating, I think, some opportunity as we look at project backlog.\nWhen we look at the data, about $50 billion of projects, that have been delayed or deferred with the equity now with the potential to be a significant funding mechanism. If we do see further near-term rate reductions, that could act ongoing as an additional stimulus. We are investing in the business through our Total Home Strategy, to be prepared for that type of environment, and excited about the potential upside related to that into 2026.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. My follow-up, it's on the medium to larger pro. Can you, Marvin, set up what Lowe's strategy is there? We've talked about pieces of it. Will you keep supply chain separate? Are there categories that you think are essential to addressing that customer, whether it's an existing home remodeler or even a new home builder? Will you cross-sell that customer using the rest of the Lowe's asset base?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYes. Simeon, I would say we feel great about the current strategy with the small to medium pro is working. We've had quarter-over-quarter growth. We think it hinges on our MyLowe's Pro Rewards loyalty platform. It's resonating well with our customers. We think it hinges well on the products that Bill's team, brings to the table every day. That was a huge gap and deficit for us seven years ago, and that is no longer the case. We also think it's important that we maintain a very competitive credit portfolio. We have a best-in-class 5%, off every day for our Lowe's credit cardholders. That also extends to the pro customer, and that resonates exceptionally well.\nWe have every intention on leveraging FBM, for fulfillment and every intention on taking the roughly 40 million, FBM pro customers, and getting them connected to complementary projects, product, and projects at Lowe's. We see a very specific void in the marketplace, for serving the small to medium pro. That's why we've been so intentional about focusing on that customer. We think we can focus on that customer in the brick-and-mortar stores and Lowe's.com. We can have a very robust strategy and platform with FBM and ADG, and we can do both concurrently. One of the reasons we talk about the importance of FBM's commercial business, is because it's countercyclical. When housing is down, that commercial business tends to outperform. That's what we're seeing right now. Overall, we think we can do both.\nThe data has proven that we have a very effective strategy with the small to medium pro.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you. Good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kate Mcshane, with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate Mcshane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to ask a little bit more about the marketplace, just in terms of what the initial performance has been, what you've seen with regards to seller onboarding, product expansion, and customer adoption, and just when you expect to scale this platform, to a point where it could start to contribute more meaningfully to margin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nKate, thank you for the question. We are really excited about the launch of our marketplace. The caveat, is it's really early, and we're not going to get into a lot of conversation relative to performance other than to say it's exceeding expectations relative to financial performance. It's exceeding expectations relative to the number of sellers, and the quality of sellers. Every seller that we've approached, and we are literally looking at four-star plus rated sellers, are required to get on this platform. We, again, had great adoption with Mirakl's technology, and they actually awarded Lowe's, as the fastest launch partner they've ever had. We were able to get that done quickly, and we feel incredibly excited.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nOne of the unique characteristics that we have is that virtually everything purchased as a marketplace item can be returned in a physical Lowe's store, because Joe, and his team partnered with technology some years back to create the technology rails to make that happen. It creates incredible convenience for the customer when they need to return something. Again, I'll let Bill talk about how the merchants are playing a role to make sure that we have a really balanced approach to how we're thinking about this.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP, Stores, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Thanks, Marvin. Kate, the only thing I would add is, obviously, early, but we're learning a lot as we progress with marketplace. We're finding that it's an opportunity to expand programs that our current vendors are providing in our stores to provide stuff that would be found on Lowes.com. We're also entering in and finding new products, products that, quite honestly, we didn't think that could be available on Lowes.com that now is available, and the consumers are engaging and buying them. We're excited about that learning and what that can do. At the forefront of when we put this together, based on being a closed system, is that we wanted it to complement what we were doing with what was happening inside of our stores. That's exactly what we're seeing early on here.\n\nKate Mcshane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Kate.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman, with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about operating leverage going forward. You've been delivering really strong operating margin improvement, this year on pretty low comps. I guess it's been mostly driven by gross margin this year. How do you think about the sustainability of gross margin, as the primary driver of that, or does the composition of margin expansion, change over time? In general, if you could speak to how you are thinking about the leverage point in the business, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSure, Seth. This is Brandon. Thanks for the question. I think as it relates to margin, very focused at this point on delivering the 12.1%, operating margin, that we communicated as part of our guide. Just as a reminder, ex-dilution from the acquisitions, that's at 12.3%, consistent with the flat bottom end of our range that we communicated at the beginning of the year. The team's done a really great job balancing flow through the balance between gross margin, SG&A, managing the tariff pressure that we've been dealing with. Honestly, the PPI initiatives continuing to deliver $1 billion, split roughly between SG&A and gross margin, that has been the primary driver in our ability to deliver mid-softer sales. I think as we look ahead into 2026, a few things I would highlight.\nWe're continuing to look at FBM and ADG, what we think housing and commercial markets are going to be looking like and the business performance there in 2026. I mentioned earlier new home starts, both single-family and multi-family, remain under pressure, but confident with these businesses that we can gain share in a down market. Marvin also mentioned, the nice balance that we have on the commercial side. Looking at that and how that impacts the margin profile into 2026. The last thing I'll mention, just as we continue to look at tariffs, those ramp here in Q3, we're expecting that also to continue ramping in Q4, and the wrap to affect the first half of the year. Managing through that and trying to understand how that impacts both sales margin and operating margin going forward. All that will be weighed.\nWe'll look at that in terms of our previous rule of thumb, and we'll have more on that as we get into our call in February for 2026.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Got it. That's helpful. I guess a related follow-up would be on the gross margin specifically. The gains this quarter really stepped up. Can you just unpack that a little bit more? Are there any timing considerations? I mean, you mentioned tariffs starting to flow through. Was there a benefit from raising prices relative to the cost, coming through, or anything else you can tell us about the mixed dynamics that seem to be supportive this quarter? Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. I would say, Seth, on Q3 margin, really nothing related to pricing or tariffs. I would say that's playing out very much in line with our expectations, just in terms of estimating when the cost is going to be flowing through margin. The great work that Bill and team, have done on the merchandising side with our suppliers, it really is the themes that I outlined in my remarks. We're lapping storm pressure from last year, so that is serving as a benefit this year. The credit portfolio has outperformed our expectations on better-than-expected losses. Bill, referenced the SKU rationalization initiative. We've seen really good sell-through results, thus far on the inventory that we're exiting there. That really was the core of the composition of the 50 basis points, that we saw in Q3.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nOkay. Great, thanks so much.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Seth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich, with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, thanks. I'd love to follow up on the traffic and ticket breakdown. If you look at the ticket expansion, it's accelerated, I think, each quarter this year. How much of that 150 basis points, of acceleration is related to some of the early tariffs going through? How much of it is mixed? How's sort of the basket evolving in terms of items in it and the size?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Greg, I can speak to ticket and transaction. When we look at ticket growth, it's really similar when we look at Q3 performance, as to what we've seen in previous quarters in terms of the drivers. It's to strengthen our pro business, also appliances. I will reference that in Q3, we did have some modest price increases. When we look at like-for-like inflation, again, modest, it's very consistent with our expectations, and also the year-to-date trends that we've seen as we continue to watch tariffs move through the system. The offset is transactions, and that has been pressured by the lower DIY demand. I'll also call out the bulk of the 100 basis points, of storm-related pressure with the DIY, is affecting the transaction. That's really the driver of the offset when we look at Q3.\nI think when we look ahead to Q4, a lot of those same drivers are expected lift from pro appliances. There will be some modest like-for-like inflation. Just as a reminder, we also have 100 basis points, of hurricane pressure that we're cycling in Q4, that will also pressure comps and pressure DIY, transactions in Q4.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Maybe just a clarification on before, the 50 basis points, is the full annualized effect on the margins of the two acquisitions, right? We have basically 15 basis points, that show up this year, and then 35 basis points next year?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYes, Greg, it's 20, on the year for 2025, and then 30 of wrap, for a total annualized run rate, into 2026 of 50 basis points.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Thank you. If I take the guide for Q4, it seems like margin should be down around 60 basis points, and it's fair to say that's the two of those sort of rolling in.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, I would say when you isolate Q4, the bulk of the operating margin decrease is going to be driven by layering in the transactions. We have $1.3 billion, of sales, for FBM. That will pressure operating margin, or dilute it down, as well as ADG. That's driving the bulk of the change in Q4.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's great. Thanks, and good luck.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Greg.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Zhihan Ma, with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the FBM-ADG integration, that you were doing. Can you just help us understand to what extent you're maybe onboarding ADG, onto the FBM-ERP system? How does that integration work in the near term?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nNo, thank you for the question. It's early days. The first rule that we have is to do no harm to the performance of either business platform, including Lowe's. We are in the early stages of the integration. The big advantage we have is FBM's current IT platform, is the same platform that we are transitioning ADG to. That is not by accident. Also, it's an existing platform that we have in our Lowe's Pro Supply businesses. We feel like we're going to have the ability to accelerate the IT integration, between the companies. As you can respect, we're in the early stages of that. We feel really good about the plan, we feel really good about the timetable, and we have the best IT team, in retail working on it. I'm very confident we'll be able to make it happen.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Just a longer-term follow-up. You mentioned the plan to de-lever to 2.75x, by mid-2027. Is the longer-term plan to resume share buybacks by then, or should we expect additional acquisitions from here?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, I would say Zhihan, is still very focused on the integration activities, as Marvin mentioned. That's going to be our focus here over the next two years. We're pausing share repo, and very much expect to get back down to that 2.75x leverage target, by 2027. That's our focus. FBM, is going to continue to run their existing play in the meantime, expanding through Greenfield expansion, and organic growth. There could be potentially some small tuck-in M&A, but that would only be what we could self-fund with additional cash flow. I think that's the best way to think about how we're going to be operating here over the next two years.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nHey, yes. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes, with Bank of America. Please just use your questions.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for squeezing me in. I'll be quick here because we all have to jump, I think, to other calls. Just two follow-ups. On the fourth quarter, the way you're planning it for seasonal and given a little bit more probably tariff prices coming through, any changes in the timing of promos? Are you doing any promos earlier related to holiday and things like that?\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nNo, Robbie. I mean, the promotional cadence remains relatively consistent to prior years. We started the quarter off with kind of the early pre-Black Friday, type stuff that we've been doing. Obviously, Black Friday, next week, then post-Black Friday, when you get into Cyber Monday events, for dot com, you get into that leading up to the holiday timeframe. We've got offers out there for both the MyLowe's Rewards members, as well as all of our consumers, both online and in store. Relatively consistent with what we've done.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. Just to follow up on flooring and the strength you guys are seeing there, you guys called out soft surfaces. Is there a trade-down going on? How do you think you're doing relative to industry? Is there something changing in flooring, or is it something about your positioning in good, better, best, or maybe a little more color there?\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. It's nice to be able to give a shout-out to the flooring team and all the work that they've been doing. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition and being able to get Daltile, into our assortment. That's starting to roll in now. Specifically to soft surface, it's really the strength of StainMaster. We called that out as one of our strongest brands. Now we've got leak defense being able to be offered. That is not a trade-down. That's a trade-up offering in the assortment. I think the team's done a really nice job of offering value out there every single day. I'd stack our soft surface offer out there every single day against what's going on in the marketplace. You could go into luxury vinyl.\nYou can go into resilient hybrid, then you can go into hard surface tile. The teams have offers out there every single day to close that consumer that's now making the decision to do a flooring project.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP, Stores, Lowe's\n\nRobbie, I would just add that the investments we've continued to make in our services business, flooring was one of our first to go central selling, where we removed that complexity of the design from the store. We shortened the time to close the customer and take them off the market. I think all in all, the products, the service level, we're really seeing some green shoots.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nReally helpful, thanks so much.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Robbie.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the Lowe's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect."

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Perlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP, Investor Relations, and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores, and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2025. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A, and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found on the Quarterly Earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin, thank you.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nGood morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we delivered sales of $20.9 billion, with comparable sales down 1.7% in line with our expectations. Despite ongoing challenges in the housing market, I'm pleased with our team's focus and execution. In the face of significant macro uncertainty, we continue to deliver operational excellence combined with value and outstanding service to our customers. This dedication drove an increase in our customer satisfaction scores, and we also earned recognition from J.D. Power, which recently named Lowe's number one in customer satisfaction among home improvement retailers. This recognition demonstrates that our investments in technology, in our clean and enjoyable stores, along with our friendly and knowledgeable associates, all reinforce our commitment to being the most helpful brand in home improvement.\nAnd although we are pleased with our continued progress in customer service, our financial results also reflect ongoing pressure in DIY, bigger ticket discretionary demand, and a slower start to spring versus last year with exceptionally unfavorable weather across much of the country. In February, as weather normalized, we were encouraged by our business performance. Customers appreciated our spacious garden centers, great selection of outdoor power equipment, and expansive assortment of grills and patio furniture, and they also took advantage of our early spring offers, which included special deals for MyLowe's Rewards members. Later in the call, Bill will provide more detail on our approach to spring and the momentum that we're seeing. Before I discuss our Q1 results in more detail, I'd like to spend time discussing our company's commitment to diversify our global sourcing efforts.\nTo provide a bit of perspective about our global sourcing, roughly 60% of our purchases originate in the U.S. or approximately $30 billion on an annual basis. Over the past several years, we've been partnering with our private and national brand suppliers to diversify our global sourcing efforts. As a result, approximately 20% of our purchase volume is currently concentrated in China. Although we're pleased with this reduced dependency, we're not satisfied and we're working to accelerate our diversification efforts. Our global sourcing team has identified exciting diversification opportunities in the U.S. and around the globe that we're actively pursuing.\nWe're.\nalso using our best-in-class product, cost management, and sophisticated pricing capabilities while leveraging the strength of our cross-functional teams across merchandising, assortment planning, supply chain, and finance. We will combine these capabilities and continue to work with our national and private brand suppliers while using a portfolio approach to ensure we continue to bring value and innovation to our customers.\nIn the meantime, let me tell you how we're planning to drive sales growth by continuing to strengthen two key pillars of our Total Home Strategy. Accelerating our Pro and Online Growth. I'll begin with our mid-single-digit growth in Pro sales this quarter. Since 2018, this leadership team has transformed our Pro product and service offering with a powerful Pro brand lineup, targeted inventory investments, and a competitive loyalty program. Now that we've established an effective playbook and a strong foundation of execution to serve the small-medium Pro, we're excited to engage a larger Pro with their planned span in a new distribution channel. To that end, we announced a deal in April to acquire Artisan Design Group, or aADG, which is a leading provider of design, distribution, and installation services for interior surface finishes including flooring, countertops, and cabinets.\nADG serves national, regional, and local home builders as well as property managers. We expect this acquisition to increase our penetration of Pro Plan spend and will position us to gain share in a highly fragmented $50 billion market. With an estimated 18 million homes needed in the U.S. by 2033, new home construction is expected to be a major driver of Pro Plan spend over the next decade. We've been impressed with ADG's strong leadership team and their customer-centric operating model reflected in the best-in-class customer satisfaction scores that it earned from top builders in the U.S.. The transaction is expected to close this quarter, so we'll provide an update on our progress during our next call.\nNow let's talk about another key pillar of our Total Home Strategy, accelerating online sales. In Q1, online sales were up 6%, driven by increases in both traffic and conversion rates. We're pleased with the technology transformation that's making these gains possible. For example, we're now able to offer an expanded assortment, more value, and an even wider extended aisle with our launch last year of the first online product marketplace and home improvement. While we're still in the early days of this initiative, we recently partnered with Mirakl, a global leader in marketplace technology, to help us scale even faster. Through Mirakl Trusted Marketplace, sellers will be able to easily manage their catalogs on Lowes.com. This will add new product categories across the home and offer DIY and Pro customers a full spectrum of value and premium products.\nWe can accomplish all of this without having to carry the inventory or invest in new fulfillment centers. As we scale our new product marketplace and unlock its potential, I look forward to keeping you updated on our continuing efforts to drive online growth.\nNow allow me to transition to how we're leveraging new AI capabilities to better serve our customers. In collaboration with OpenAI, we launched Milo, the first AI-powered home improvement virtual advisor. Since home improvement is inherently complex, Milo provides step-by-step instructions for any project with any level of complexity, from how to fix a leaky faucet to how to build a deck, and everything in between. It helps customers find and purchase the right tools and materials for their projects directly on Lowes.com or the Lowe's app.\nWe're encouraged by our progress in leveraging AI to streamline the customer experience, and I commend our technology and digital team for their outstanding contributions. Notably in Q1, Lowe's Mobile App earned the prestigious Webby Award and was recognized as the best mobile app for 2025. This is another reflection that our investments in technology and innovation are paying off.\nBefore I wrap, let me update you on our commitment to be a good neighbor in the communities where we do business. Earlier this month, we celebrated our commitments to supporting our communities by announcing our efforts to measure our impact in a new way through our Here to Help initiative with a goal to deliver 10 million sq ft of impact nationwide this year. This includes our ongoing efforts to create safe, affordable housing, respond to disasters, and revitalize communities like our five-year, $100 million commitment to improve Hometowns across the country. This new initiative reflects our commitment to improve the communities where our soldiers live and work, and we look forward to providing you with updates later in the year. In closing, I want to thank our frontline associates for their continued hard work, especially during this key spring selling season.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks Marvin and good morning everyone. We're pleased that our first quarter sales were in line with our expectations, driven by broad-based strength in Pro and online across multiple merchandising categories. Beginning in Hardlines. After a slow start to February, our spring season is off and running. As the weather improved, we delivered solid growth in key categories including patio furniture, fertilizer, grass seed, generators, and irrigation. Customers responded to our innovative products and new affordable designs, even when it came to some discretionary purchases. For example, our private-brand Ashton five-piece patio dining set by Style Selections was a big hit at less than $400. We're also continuing to earn DIY customers' loyalty through MyLowe's Rewards. We just marked the first anniversary of this program which has more than 30 million members who spend nearly 50% more than non-members.\nWe're cultivating their loyalty and using data-driven marketing to engage them with the right message at the right time to convert sales. For example, during our Spring Feast event, we offered members special deals every two weeks on lawn and garden products, patio furniture, outdoor power equipment, and more, plus members-only door-busters in-store and online. And new this year, in early April, we launched Mulch Madness. During this event, customers saved on five bags of mulch for ten bucks, and for the first time, members also received five times bonus points and a free gift. We also brought customers industry-leading innovation this spring with products like the new EGO Line IQ attachment-capable string trimmer.\nThis product makes it easy to load the trimmer line with the push of a button, and its attachment capabilities mean it can convert into eight different tools, including an edger, hedge trimmer, and pole saw. This is one of more than 20 new EGO items that we're launching this year. We're also in stock with the industry's best brands to help customers complete all their projects, like Scotts Fertilizer, Miracle-Gro soils, Toro lawnmowers, along with products from Craftsman and Kobalt. Now turning to building products, we delivered positive comp sales in building materials and rough plumbing with strength in roofing, drywall, plumbing repair, water heaters, and air circulation categories. In lumber, we delivered growth in siding, treated lumber, and composite decking. In fact, Lowe's has the largest selection of composite decking brands, including the top two with Trex and TimberTech, along with an improved offering from Deckorators.\nLet's talk about home decor. Our continued strength in appliances helped us deliver growth in both transactions and average ticket. We saw growth across all major categories including refrigeration, laundry, cooking, and dishwashers. As the industry leader in appliances, we have the widest assortment of top brands. Using our Market Delivery model, we can deliver these big and bulky products next day to virtually every zip code in the U.S. and, of course, our knowledgeable red vest associates are always there to help customers choose the right products and highlight new and innovative items that can meet their needs. For example, we're introducing the next step in all-in-one laundry with the new Samsung Bespoke AI vented all-in-one combo washer and dryer.\nThis one machine washes and dries clothes in just over an hour without having to transfer loads, and it uses the existing 110 volt outlet and dryer venting found in most homes. Our paint department has become the Home Center Color Authority where we instill color confidence in consumers with trusted Sherwin-Williams colors. We're excited to see the new marketing campaign from Sherwin-Williams, which uses their iconic color palette to entice customers to shop Lowe's, including the Pro who paints where we continue to gain traction with our compelling value and expanded assortment. While we're energized by new and innovative products, we're also mindful of the current market dynamics. Bigger ticket project spending remains under pressure in interior categories like flooring, kitchens, and bath, with many customers still choosing to delay those larger purchases.\nI'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our approach to spring. Our teams have never been more in sync as we prepared for this important season. Our stores, supply chain, inventory, vendor, and merchant teams have worked hard to make sure that we provide the best service, product value, and innovation to our customers. For this spring season, we are ready with strong in stocks across our core categories, including our seasonal items, so that we can serve both our DIY and Pro customers with great values on items that they are looking for as we head into the upcoming Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Fourth of July holidays. Looking ahead, I'm not only pleased with the great deals and innovation that we have for our DIY and Pro customers, I'm also excited to see some of the best in stock positions during my tenure at Lowe's.\nWhen you combine that with the outstanding staffing and customer service in our stores, the result was our recognition as number one in customer satisfaction among home improvement retailers. From J.D. Power.\nAs I wrap up, I want.\nTo thank all of these teams as well as our MST associates for their support, partnership, and great execution this spring. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThank you Bill.\nGood morning everyone.\nLet me start by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work and dedication during the spring season. Their efforts are paying off with customer satisfaction scores up 100 basis points over last year as we leverage better technology and ongoing process improvements to enhance the shopping experience. Turning to Pro, in our most recent survey, Pros indicated that the project backlogs remain healthy, but they are feeling a little less confident as might be expected given the uncertain macro environment. Although Pro's may be a bit cautious right now, our ability to deliver mid-single-digit growth in Pro sales comps in Q1 is a reflection that our strategy is working.\nOne highlight this quarter we're really pleased with the successful nationwide relaunch of our Pro loyalty program. The updated program, now called MyLowe's Pro Rewards, allows pros to earn points from day one and is much more intuitive to use. Just one example, Pro's only need to provide their phone number at checkout, getting them back to the job site faster, and joining has never been easier with the addition of our new Spanish language enrollment option. With a program that's easier to use and understand, we're expecting greater utilization, driving repeat purchases and higher spend. Another way we're driving momentum is through our new technology Workbench for our Pro sales associates. They can use this digital tracking tool to quickly identify their leads and prioritize the quotes to close. This drives both the better customer experience and greater associate productivity.\nAs discussed earlier, our planned acquisition of ADG represents a natural step in driving pro penetration by extending our reach with the new cohort of pro customers, single- and multifamily home builders. Turning now to our Perpetual Productivity Improvement, or PPI initiatives, in conjunction with the rollout of MyLowe's on Lowe's.com for customers, we've also released MyLowe's Companion for our store associates. Built on the same technology with immediate access to product details, project advice, and inventory information, this AI-powered app gives associates the product and project knowledge to sell with confidence regardless of tenure or experience. Associates across all 1,700-plus stores can access MyLowe's Companion on their mobile devices, marking the first time a retailer has successfully implemented this kind of technology at scale.\nWith this knowledge at their fingertips, our associates can quickly feel confident in answering customers' questions even if they've just started in the store or been asked to.\nCover a new department.\nWe're also driving productivity with our Gig Delivery Network, which has been an important component of our enhanced Omnichannel customer experience. We're now using this capability to help us meet spring demand, specifically during the Mulch Madness event that Bill just mentioned. In the past, this high traffic event would take up valuable flatbed distribution capacity, but this spring we shifted a portion of the volume to Gig Delivery. This provided an efficient delivery experience for customers buying mulch while freeing up capacity to meet the delivery needs of other Pro and DIY customers. We're also pleased to announce that our East Asheville store reopened earlier this month after damage from urricane Helene.\nDuring the hurricane, the store was submerged in over 18ft of water, so we are thrilled that we are now able to reopen it to serve our customers and community, and we're on track to open five to 10 new stores later this year in line with what we shared at our analyst and investor conference. Of course, all this is only possible because of our hard-working associates. As a demonstration of our appreciation, we closed our stores on Easter for the sixth consecutive year, giving associates time on this very special day to rest and recharge with family and friends. As I wrap up, I want to take a moment to thank our veterans, including our veteran associates who can be identified by their camouflage vests.\nLowe's is ranked among the top military friendly brands in the U.S., which speaks to our company's commitment to the military community. As a Marine, I couldn't be more proud of Lowe's efforts to honor those who served, especially as we approached Memorial Day. Looking ahead with excellent spring staffing levels and ongoing innovation across technology and service, I'm confident that we're offering a best-in-class omni-channel shopping experience for our customers this season to close. I want to congratulate our store associates for being recognized by J.D. Power as the number one customer satisfaction among home improvement retailers. This is a testament to their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning. Starting with our first quarter results, diluted earnings per share of $2.92 were in line with our expectations. Q1 sales totaled $20.9 billion, and comparable sales were down 1.7% in line with our expectations as we cycled over an earlier start to spring last year. Comparable average ticket was up 2.1% with continued growth in Pro and appliances, somewhat offset by ongoing pressure in DIY discretionary project demand. Comparable transactions declined 3.8%, partly driven by unfavorable weather earlier in the quarter that pressured spring traffic, which make up a larger portion of our transactions this time of year. Given the poor weather early in Q1, comps were down 5.4% in February, up 1.7% in March, and down 2.6% in April.\nAs our stores are closed on Easter Sunday, we estimate that the later timing of Easter benefited March comps and pressured April comps by a similar amount. Adjusting for the Easter shift, comp sales were down approximately 0.9% in March and up approximately 0.2% in April.\nGross margin was 33.4% of sales in the first quarter, up 19 basis points from last year, driven by multiple PPI initiatives as well as some modest improvement in shrink and credit revenue. SGA of 19.3% of sales delevered 56 basis points, driven by lower sales volumes, the wrap of incremental wage actions for frontline associates, and higher healthcare-related costs. Operating margin rate of 11.9% declined 50 basis points versus prior year, and the effective tax rate was 23.9% in line with prior year. Inventory ended Q1 at $18.3 billion in line with prior year with strong in-stocks across the store, including key spring seasonal items. Turning now to capital allocation, in the first quarter we generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow.\nCapital expenditures totaled $518 million as we continue to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including the construction of new stores expected to open later this year. In the quarter, we paid $645 million in dividends at $1.15 per share, and in April we repaid $750 million in debt maturities, helping us deliver adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.99x and a return on invested capital of 31% at the end of Q1.\nLast month we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Artisan Design Group for $1.325 billion. We plan to use cash on hand to finance the transaction, suspend share repurchases this year, and repay the remaining $1.75 billion in bonds maturing in September. The transaction is expected to close in Q2, and it's expected to be accretive to diluted earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after closing. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, today we are affirming our fiscal 2025 outlook. We continue to expect sales ranging from $83.5-84.5 billion, with comparable sales in a range of flat to up 1%. We expect operating margin in a range of 12.3%-2.4%, and full year diluted earnings per share of approximately $12.15-$12.40.\nWe also expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion as we invest in our Total Home strategic priorities and begin to ramp up new store builds. Please note that this outlook does not include any potential impacts related to the acquisition of Artisan Design Group.\nTo assist with your modeling, here are a few items to keep in mind for the second quarter. We continue to expect comp sales in the first half to be roughly flat with approximately $400 million in spring demand shifting into Q2, where we are cycling particularly poor weather. As Bill mentioned, we also have strong in stocks, including in critical seasonal categories, as well as visibility up into our supply chain, so we're confident that we can meet customer demand this spring. Taking this into account, we expect second quarter comp sales to be approximately 150 basis points above the bottom end of our full year guide. We also expect second quarter operating margin rate to be approximately 10 basis points above the prior year adjusted operating margin rate.\nIn closing, we remain confident in our team's ability to execute at a high level and manage through this challenging environment as well as any team in retail. We continue to invest in our Total Home Strategy and remain focused on delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. With that, we'll open it up for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We are now ready for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, press Star one on your telephone keypad. To store your question, press Star two. In order to allow questions from as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning everyone, and nice job managing the quarter. My first question, it's on the relationship of comp and to expense leverage or operating leverage for the rest of the year.\nI guess we don't know each quarter.\nYou gave us a little bit of.\nHelp with the second quarter, it looks like that ratio is a little bit higher for the balance of the year. Something like 25 basis points of expansion for whatever is left in comp.\nIs that right?\nAre you getting more out of the business or is it just the timing? Because we don't know the comp cadence through the year, and it's that same, I think it was 10 basis points of leverage relationship.\nThanks.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, hey Simeon, good morning, it's Brandon. So as it relates to the specifics on the comp guide, let me kind of break it down in terms of first half and second half. The first half mainly a weather story. We're expecting roughly flat comps over the course of the first half, and we talked about the shift of the $400 million from spring to play out Q1 into Q2. Q1 played out as expected. So as I referenced, expecting roughly 1.5% Q2, we feel like we have strong inventory levels and we're ready. We have a lot of confidence in Q2 expectations, and then implied in the second half is roughly a +1%. We expect to continue to see momentum with our total home sales initiatives offsetting hurricane pressure. So that's kind of the shape of the top line as it relates to margin.\nWe're expecting gross margins to hold roughly flat for the full year. The PPI portfolio initiatives continue to offset cost and inflationary pressures on the SGA side. The team continues to outperform there, managing a number of lines really well. We've got roughly $500 million in OPEX offsetting there across a number of pressures that we're seeing. So that kind of gets you to the guide of 12.3%-12.4%. Again, Q1 roughly in line with expectations. That's how we're thinking about Q2 to Q4.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And then shifting gears maybe. For Marvin, I wanted to ask about the larger Pro and Artisan Design Group. Is the deal signaling that you're planning to move quicker here if opportunities present themselves?\nHow do we think about that in relation for Lowe's?\nAnd then, can you talk about how?\nQuickly, the business is growing organically, or.\nWhatever that growth rate of the business looks like. Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYes, we feel really good about the acquisition. You know, we've been really disciplined with how we've managed our capital, and so anytime we decide to make any acquisition, this is well thought out, and then we have a lot of confidence in it. I think the best way to answer your question is as we think about capital allocation, it really remains the same philosophy and that we're always going to invest in the business. We're going to always think first about how we can get the healthy return that's going to be long standing and sustainable. Having said that, we also believe that it's important to find ways to grow. And as we look at ADG as an example, we think that they are perfectly positioned for the recovery that has to happen over the next decade in housing.\nTo us, you know, we know we're in a repressed period, but as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you got 18 million new homes needed by 2033. Artisan Design Group is number one in their marketplace from a perspective of service and overall business. We think that we have some really attractive adjacencies that we can add to that portfolio. Also, they're in a very fragmented environment, which means that they have a healthy pipeline themselves of potential targets to continue to grow through acquisition. We're going to allow them to continue to follow a really best in class process to pursue those potential targets within their pipeline. We're not changing our strategy, we're just being opportunistic. We feel like that we've created a really nice playbook and execution model for the small to medium Pro.\nThe data reflects that with mid-single-digit positive comps this quarter. But this gives us an opportunity to kind of broaden our Pro portfolio and to now have the ability to be in a separate channel with a $50 billion TAM that just gives us additional opportunity to grow when the market continues to recover.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSimeon, this is Brandon. Just specifics on financials. ADG delivered $1.8 billion in sales in 2024. As I mentioned, we expect EPS to be accretive in the first full fiscal year. So that would be fiscal 2026, and we're going to hold on. Given anything more specific, we expect to close in Q2, and we'll hold off and be prepared to talk more in August.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thanks. Good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGood morning, everyone.\nBrandon, I think in your commentary you mentioned percentage of transactions being sort of spring transactions more elevated in the first?\nHalf of the year and maybe potentially.\nRight, more elevated in the Q2 this year. So any sort of context to help us better understand sort of how reliant or how relevant spring is in terms of percentage of transactions Q1 versus Q2?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nI don't know that I'll get into the details. Steve, on Q1, Q2, I'll just say Q1 average ticket up just over 2% continues to be driven by strength in Pro, also momentum in Appliances. We also saw some benefit from storm recovery projects. As you referenced, comp transactions down 3.9%. It is driven by fewer smaller ticket seasonal transactions and ongoing DIY pressures that we're seeing in the business. Large ticket for us was slightly positive. Again, that's Appliances and Pro strength, and that's a continuation that we saw from Q4. But I would say as you look out at Q2 and for sure over the balance of the year, we continue to expect average ticket to be the primary driver of comps, and we would expect to see transactions recover specifically in Q2 as the business starts to get momentum.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThat's helpful. Then, Marvin, just a quick follow up. I think one of the initiatives that.\nWasn't mentioned in the prepared remarks is.\nLocalization, discussed during the analyst day and so forth. Any updates on sort of the localization strategy, how that's progressing, how many stores?\ntouching on how much of the opportunity.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nIs still ahead for Lowe's? Yes, Steve, so I'll speak about it more from the standpoint of space productivity because we've taken localization and just made it really part of a broader initiative on just improving productivity both in our physical space, in our stores, and virtually online. So I'll let Bill talk a bit about some of the key initiatives like Workwear, an aspect that we're really excited about and what our plans are to continue to expand that and how we think that's going to give us an opportunity to just continue to have more productive space in our stores.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, Marvin. Steve, we're well underway with all three of those initiatives. We'll have rural completed here kind of end of Q2, early Q3 Workwear. We're well down the path of having roughly more than 1,000 stores complete by the end of this year and wrapping up, you know, early next year for the remainder of those. And then we continue on the same track with our pet initiative. And we're excited about that, continuing to learn as we go and continuing to adjust as we go as well as we roll out these stores and as we put, you know, these products in. But we're real pleased with the results of all three.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Lucy's here with your question.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is just, I was wondering if we could get a little more on tariffs in terms of, you know, pricing impacts that you guys might be expecting and, you know, the impact on the private brand part of your business versus, you know, vendor announced price increases and, you know, just color on how you're, you know, managing that there.\nI have a follow-up.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo, Robert, I'll take the pricing part and I'll let Bill just provide a broader perspective on tariffs in general. I think for us, as always, we're going to take a portfolio approach to pricing. You know, we're pleased that we built best in class tools for price management that's going to help us navigate any environment and we have great elasticity data across products and geographies. I think the key for us is the merchants have been cultivating and developing just wonderful relationships with suppliers for the last six years. And this is when those relationships start to pay off. Before I hand it to Bill, I think the key point for us is that we're going to be really price competitive in the home improvement channel like we always are. We're not in the habit of donating market share to the competition.\nAnd so in this environment, we're going to be as keenly focused on competing on price as we are every single day. And we think we can do that and still deliver on the financial commitments that Brandon outlined in his prepared comments. I'll let Bill talk a little bit more about the overall global sourcing philosophy that we have here.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, Marvin. And Robbie, I think it's important that everyone understands how we look at global sourcing and we look at it really from two lenses, a direct and indirect perspective. Direct being where we direct import, where we're the, where Lowe's is the importer of record, and then indirect where we purchase from suppliers and then they are the importer of record. And currently, as Brandon said in his remarks and Marvin said in his, roughly 60% of our purchases are out of the U.S., the next largest is China, sitting at roughly 20%. And you can understand where some of those categories fall. You know, a lot of holiday trimmer, tree ceiling fans, small appliances, tools, et cetera make up that 20%.\nWe've been working really hard over the last four or five years to diversify, just as everybody has, and partnering closely with both private and national brand suppliers to find different sourcing locations and working to do that. We're also trying to accelerate that as it relates to our private brand portfolio and doing the same with our national brands. As Marvin said, it all comes down to relationships. We're really pleased with the relationships.\nThat we've built over the six plus years.\nWe feel like we have a strong track record of managing our assortments, managing the cost as they come as it comes to us. We'll continue to run our playbook as it relates to that.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's really helpful.\nJust a quick follow up for Marvin. Marvin, marketplace.\nDream the dream for us here. How big could this be and how important could this be?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, I can tell you that we're excited about it, and the partnership with Mirakl is important because it's the number one technology platform for large marketplace sellers. And so it's an easier pivot for them to transition to Lowe's.com and an easier pivot for our digital team to load their catalogs in a very, very efficient way, in a very time-sensitive way. We have high expectations as we looked at the entire retail landscape across the globe, and we look at brick-and-mortar retailers that have demonstrated the most effective omnichannel strategies and sustainable growth. One correlating factor is a marketplace existence. And we're pleased to be the first product marketplace and home improvement.\nWe have again high expectations that not only can we manage core home improvement, which our team does really well now, but we also, now with a marketplace environment, can manage premium and value products. We can do it without adding, you know, capital-intensive fulfillment centers and without adding additional inventory to our balance sheet. So early days. But we're excited about the progress, and we're excited about the number of world-class sellers that are eager to join our marketplace, and we look forward to updating you all as this become a more mature initiative.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSounds great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please receive your questions.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning, guys. So given the softer trends you continue to see in bigger ticket projects, first, how much of that mix do you think that generally represents? I know it changes quarter to quarter, but on an annualized basis. And then second, what do you think you need to see to unlock greater activity in that segment? Is it improved consumer confidence or is it lower interest rates? Because presumably those are opposed scenarios or is it something else entirely? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo, Scot, I'll take the first part, then I'll let Brandon and Bill join in. Add any additional commentary. I think from an overall consumer perspective, we feel like our overall consumer remains healthy. From a balance sheet perspective. And as we look at the historic demand drivers of our business, they still remain positive, and I've repeated them in the past. Home price appreciation, aging housing stock, personal disposable income is now growing faster than inflation. And overall, you know, we see rising real income and lower debt. So overall our consumer is in great shape. But we still, as we said in the prepared comments, have the DIY customer pulling back on large, big-ticket discretionary. And that is in essence the issue that we're dealing with.\nWe believe that part of that is elevated mortgage rates and mortgage rates not falling as perceived by many, you know, in the marketplace. So we're just managing that as best we can. I'll let Brandon and Bill provide any additional perspective after just giving you a view of what we see the consumer.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nScot, I would just add, as Marvin mentioned, consumer overall very healthy. But for us in home improvement, especially big ticket, the affordability challenge remained the primary concern. Inflation rates, as Marvin mentioned, rates still hovering 30-year mortgage around 7%. We've yet to really see it scale. The consumer reengage in larger discretionary categories still mainly sitting on the sidelines. I think the good news is the trends aren't getting any worse. You know, you referenced the greater than $500 ticket sentiment has softened a little bit more recently, but we haven't seen that necessarily translate into consumer behavior yet. So, for us as we look out, we're looking for sustained increase in discretionary projects and DIY traffic for the inflection point. We don't have that necessarily expected or baked into 2025. It's sort of expected. It's going to be more of the same at this point.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nAnd Brandon, I think the only thing I would add is that from a point, from a positive or a bright spot perspective, our appliance business continues to be, you know, from a big ticket perspective, you know, a good new story for us. And it's really a trend that's been ongoing since really the back half of last year and has trended into Q1. You know, we saw strength across every single major category, which includes refrigeration, laundry, cooking, and dishwashers. The team's done a really nice job of introducing new and innovative products. I spoke to some of those in our, in my prepared remarks. Whether that's all in one laundry, whether that's in cooking, whether that's in refrigeration.\nAnd then you add in what we've done from a delivery perspective and the market leadership position that we have to be able to deliver to really any zip code within two days, and same day is, you know, is something that we're really excited about. And again, roughly 100,000 appliances break every day. So you've got to be ready for that. In our in-stock position, appliances have never been better. So those are all positives when we look at that part of the big-ticket business.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks, guys.\nGood luck.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Scot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays, please receive your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat.\nHey, good morning everyone.\nSounded like Q1 was limited by weather.\nCan you give us a little bit?\nMore perspective on what you're seeing in the markets where you've had steadier spring weather conditions? How much of those markets outperform? And just related to that, if you look at the April adjusted comp, the positive 0.2%, do you view that as the run rate of the business? And I guess you're kind of guiding to the first half being flat. So is that how you're thinking about it? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, the simplest way for me to answer the question is when the sun is shining, our business performs a lot better. And so when you look at Q1, the variation by geography was driven exclusively by weather. And as weather continues to moderate, our business continues to get better. And that's reflective in the adjusted comp number you reflected for April. I mean, we feel good about the trends in May. May is consistent with the guidance that Brandon provided and consistent with our expectations. And Brandon, I don't know if you have anything else to add.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nNo, I would just add, Seth, just in terms of weather benefit, we did see 50 basis points of impact from hurricanes Helene and Milton from back half of last year that turned into Q1, and those were mostly benefited in our southeast region. So just in addition to the normal weather, I'll reference that.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Okay, great.\nVery helpful. And then as I think about the full year guidance, you talked about first half being flat. It implies the second half could potentially accelerate in that range. If I recall, the initial guidance suggested that it would be more driven by your own initiatives. I'm just curious, is that still the case? Has your view on the macro for the back half changed at all?\nJust help us bridge that a little bit more.\nThank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, Seth. No change to the macro assumptions from what we laid out in our guide in February. As I mentioned earlier, we're working through still a number of short-term challenges around rates, cautious consumer affordability, the lock-in effect. Those are all things that we assumed at the beginning of the year. That's still the expectation as we move through Q2 in the second half. You're exactly right, the momentum is really around our Total Home Strategy. There is some offset with hurricane pressure in the second half. There was about 100 basis points each in Q3 and Q4. The benefit from our strategy is we look at both the Pro with loyalty, job site delivery momentum with Extended Aisle.\nMarvin talked about marketplace momentum with DIY in the second half, some of our category accelerators, all that, and the ramp in the momentum is what's been included in that second half comp expectation.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, great.\nThanks very much.\nAppreciate it.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Please receive your questions.\nGreat.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Retail Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nGood morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on DIY. Marvin, curious, do you think the environment has gotten more competitive from retailers outside of the traditional home improvement channel? For example, the e-commerce marketplace has gotten bigger in your categories, and one is now growing their focus on rural. Do you see this as a threat to your business as you grow your rural framework?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nNo, I appreciate the question. I think that retail has always been competitive, and with the ease of e-commerce coming into any type of a space with easily parcel-shipped product, it's going to just continue to get more and more competitive. Having said that, we do believe there's a lot to be said about product knowledge, about store environment, about ease of shopability both in store and online. That's one of the reasons why we've invested so much in technology, and one of the reasons why we mentioned our prepared comments is reflected in J.D. Power's representation of Lowe's being number one in customer service in the home improvement sector.\nYeah, I'll let Joe talk a little bit about some of the things that we're doing to compete with non-traditional competitors based on product knowledge, based on giving our associates tools so that they can help customers solve problems in their homes. We think that's going to be the difference between us growing and maintaining share, and also taking share from other competitors that don't have the capital focus or the technology platform to continue to invest in innovation, which we think is going to play a huge role in being competitive.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThanks Marvin and Steve. Just to follow up on Marvin's comments, when I think about the MyLowe's Companion app that we rolled out to our associates and that product project knowledge right at their fingertips, even for brand new associates, the adoption rate is far ahead of schedule. The amount of input that the associates are giving back to the app, and we're really pleased with these tools. In addition, I mentioned our gig delivery network and how we're coming to market for things like Mulch Madness for the DIY customer without impacting our Pro customer. We have the Pro Extended Aisle in store, and so really excited about all the different touch points that we have across the DIY network.\nAs we continue our mode shifting to compete online, whether the product is in the store, in a warehouse, or special order, our associates are confident, and they have access to it at their fingertips today.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Retail Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nGreat, thanks for that detail. The second question I had is also kind of strategic, the acquisition Artisan Design Group. Do you view this as the first of many? Like, basically, does this acquisition grow some of the capabilities of the business, and maybe we could see some more M&A in the future?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nNo.\nI appreciate the question. I think the short answer is we're just going to be opportunistic. We believe that we've done a really nice job of being disciplined around looking at potential acquisition targets. Whatever we decide to potentially acquire, we want it to tie directly to complementing our Total Home Strategy. We think ADG does exactly that. We still want to get this transaction closed, as Brandon mentioned, and we think that will get done by the end of this quarter. We're going to just continue to look at all opportunities that we think will allow us to grow, allow us to bring returns to our shareholders, and to continue to just use our capital in a very efficient way.\nMore to come on that. We look forward to just keeping you updated on ADG and how we believe that they can benefit us, and we can benefit them from a category adjacency standpoint. That's going to be incredibly complementary in a marketplace. We currently are generating $0 of revenue, and that's new home construction. We think that the potential growth opportunities over the decade are going to be incredibly attractive.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Retail Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nUnderstood.\nThanks for the detail.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks.\nGood morning, everybody. My first question is on the Pro business. Do you think there was any impact to the business related to weather in the first quarter? Mid-single-digits, very strong. It did moderate from the pace last year. Was there any impact, and are you seeing improvement in that as the weather has broken?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThis is Marvin. The short answer is weather absolutely impacted the business in Q1. As the season and weather start to moderate on a more seasonally consistent basis, the business improves, you know, along those same exact lines. If you do the adjustment for closing in Easter, we had comp improvement each month of the quarter, with a comp adjustment of April being positive. We feel great about our Pro business. We feel great about the momentum in that business, and we also are really pleased with the adoption of our updated Pro loyalty program, MyLowe's Pro Rewards, the ease of use, and also the number of new customers that are joining the platform. We feel like our playbook for the small-to-medium Pro continues to work, and we have really no concerns about the trajectory of our Pro business.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. A follow up question on the tariff side. Historically, the industry has managed to gross margin rate, especially considering the technology that you referenced, Marvin, and the leverage that you have over vendors. Does that remain your expectation given where tariff rates sit? There's never been so much focus on inventory accounting methods. I think your FIFO, and does that portend some benefits, maybe earlier.\nThat you would ultimately just give back later, but you know, a little bit of a sine curve around the merchandise margin. Thank you.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nChris, I'll take the first part, then I'll let Brandon join in. From our perspective, I guess the best way for us to think about this is that we have tools that will allow us to manage this and manage this in a way that we're going to minimize any impacts to our customers. As I said earlier, we're going to be price competitive. It's something that we feel is incredibly important to our business, and it's also important for us to maintain market share. We're not donating share to any competitor by sitting back and not being price competitive across any of the categories that we're selling, whether they're domestic or imported. We believe that through our portfolio approach and some of the work that Bill, Seemantini do with line structures, we're going to be in great shape.\nWe've done all the math, and based on the current tariff environment, we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to deliver the financial guidance that Brandon updated. I'll let Brandon talk to you a little bit about the accounting in our world and how we see that primarily impacting us in the back half of the year.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nChris, this is Brandon. On the margin and the inventory piece of this I referenced earlier, our expectations for gross margin are roughly flat for the full year. That's inclusive of any impacts from trade policy. As you reference, our accounting methodology for inventory is first in, first out, so FIFO accounting, which essentially means any incremental costs that we see will flow through our margin as we turn through our inventory layers. I referenced earlier just the strength that we have in our current inventory, so our current inventory layers and visibility up into the supply chain. We do expect any incremental impact that we see to be more concentrated in the second half of our year, and that's baked into the expectation. As you think about first half and margin, really minimal impact from any of this activity.\nAs Marvin's reference, as we look out at the second half, we're going to continue to take a portfolio approach with what we're doing, and continuing to work through and minimize any impact to our customers. That's what's baked in our expectation.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nJust to clarify that meaning, like really no FIFO impact early, but some headwinds later, or is it the tailwinds later than headwinds as you get into 2026?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah.\nChris, the actual cost will be flowing through in the second half, but all of our mitigation actions and everything that Marvin and Bill have outlined, we expect to manage, and we expect to offset the majority of that.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nUnderstood.\nThanks very much. Have a great spring.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey everyone, thanks for the question. The first one on appliances, one of the few categories that outperform the company. Can you talk about the sales pull forward, if any, that you saw in that category? Also, have you seen any pull forward in other large ticket categories? Furniture, outdoor, patio, grills, anything like that that helped to lift the Q1 comp later in the period or even early into Q2?\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, David, it's Bill. You know, we really didn't see anything that we could, you know, hang our hat on as being pulled forward. You know, specifically to appliances, I said in an earlier response, really pleased with just the trajectory of that business and how it's performed really since the back half of last year into the first quarter of this year, and how it's performing early in Q2. You know, 100,000 appliances break every day. The efforts that we've put around making that experience easier for our customer and for our associates to sell the product, and for our customers to navigate both online and in store, are all things that we're really proud of.\nThe work that our supply chain team has done to be able to deliver to virtually anywhere in the United States in two days or less, I think is one of our big competitive advantages, in addition to all the work that the merchants have done to bring just great product and innovation across every single category. That's what drives this business, and that's what we're excited about.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nDavid, I would just add, as Bill referenced with appliances specifically, as we look at unit growth and acceleration, we started to see that early in Q3 last year and saw that accelerate the better part of the back half of last year, obviously strength as we got in here to Q1. The activity sort of pre post any change in trade policy is there. At this point, we do not believe we are seeing any indication of any sort of widespread pull forward. We are going to continue to monitor as we get into the balance of the year. Robie, with that we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Peter Benedict with BAIRD. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Baird\n\nOh, hey guys.\nThanks for sneaking me in.\nReally, my question too. The first was around kind of your.\nExtended aisle effort and more specifically as it relates to the Pro and some of the things that you're doing there. I know you're expecting some scaling of.\nThese micro initiatives, I guess, into the.\nBusiness over the back half of the year.\nCan you maybe give us a little.\nMore perspective on what exactly is happening with the extended aisle and how many vendors are starting to kind of take advantage of some of those capabilities? That's my first question.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, Peter, I don't want to get into that level of specifics, but what I will tell you is as we did a soft launch of this initiative, all the vendors that we were able to get in our system, their business performance accelerated dramatically. We are excited about this. This also helps us with fulfillment because in many cases, a lot of these Pro vendors have their own delivery capabilities and they are doing job site delivery in addition to providing us with great cost that we could provide great retails onto our customers. I'll let Joe add a little bit of color to this because his team, along with Qvan's team, are managing this really closely in the stores.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks Marvin and Peter. Just important to remember early innings. As we onboard incremental suppliers throughout 2025 in scale, we're going to continue to see this business grow. Here's what it really does for us. It allows immediate visibility to our suppliers' inventory, and as well, we have our volume, pricing, and delivery speed all incorporated. We can now generate quotes within minutes, seven days a week, on things that used to take days and four to five days a week. As Marvin said, there's an option for direct deliveries right from the supplier to the customer. Those are just a few of the unlocks that the extended aisle gives. We're really excited about it now.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Baird\n\nThat's helpful.\nThanks.\nMy follow-up would just be, beyond the China exposure, around 20%. Is there a way to think about where you could potentially take that over time, or are we kind of at levels where the product coming from there is basically going to come from there? Thanks so much.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nPeter, I'll answer the first part and I'll let Bill provide some perspective. My request would be for any retailer providing global sourcing percent by country of origin. It'd be really good to get a definition of how they calculate that because as Bill articulated, we look at it from a direct and indirect and we combine that together. In a lot of cases, companies look at it only as direct where they are the importer of record. We try to have a really more holistic view of how we view it. Based on indirect and direct, we estimate it is roughly 20%. As we noted, we're working aggressively with our global sourcing team in a combination of Bill's team and Margie Bagel's supply chain team to reduce that exposure. We feel like we're headed in a great position to do that.\nI'll let Bill provide a little bit more perspective on that.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Peter, I covered some of this earlier, but it's, you know, again we're looking at, in partnership with both private brand and national brand suppliers, to find different countries in order to produce this.\nIn producing this product. In addition, you know, as Brandon touched on, looking at, you know, SKU by SKU, product category by product category, looking at line structures, looking at assortments, and looking at what makes sense going forward. You know, in some cases, some of those items may not make sense going forward. We want to make sure that we do the right thing sourcing it from the right location. Just because we found another country to produce it, it may not end up short term being the right country to do, you know, right out of the gate. You know, we're taking a very disciplined approach, and the team's working really hard at it, looking at it across all the categories, and you can just imagine, you know, the level and magnitude of work that's required when you have.\nTo go do this.\nSKU by SKU, vendor by vendor.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Baird\n\nThat's helpful.\nThanks so much, guys.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP, Investor Relations, and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Lowe's first quarter 2025 earnings call. You may now disconnect.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\n[audio distortion]\n[audio distortion]\n[audio distortion]"

My name is Rob and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President of Stores, and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As noted in our press release this morning announcing the definitive agreement to acquire FBM, there are accompanying slides to today's comments which will be referenced on today's call. I would like to remind you that our notices regarding forward-looking statements are included in our press releases, and presentation that can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for Fiscal 2025 Act.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, or FBM, a premier distributor of interior building products including drywall, metal framing, ceiling systems, insulation, commercial doors and hardware, and other complementary products. This acquisition represents a transformational move when it comes to advancing our total home strategy and enhancing long-term shareholder value. With the acquisition of FBM, we are strategically expanding our Pro offering to serve the large Pro, especially their plan spend. We're now well positioned to not only continue driving growth with our core DIY and small to medium Pro customers, but this acquisition also unlocks our ability to serve the larger Pro within a $250 billion total addressable market.\nThe acquisition of FBM strengthens our portfolio, diversifies our revenue streams, and allows us to capture a larger portion of Pro sales, all of which is expected to deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders. Brandon and I will discuss this acquisition in more detail later in the call, but first I'll turn to our results for the quarter. In Q2 2025, we delivered sales of $24 billion with comparable sales up 1.1%. We drove solid performance in both Pro and DIY and strength in seasonal sales as weather improved throughout the quarter. In addition to sales growth, our persistent focus on productivity drove better than expected operating performance, leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.33, an increase of 5.6% over last year. Our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives continue to deliver results we set out to achieve.\nThis is a testament to the culture we built prioritizing continuous improvement throughout the business. Later in the call, Bill and Joe will share specific examples of these initiatives across the board. We're pleased with the results we delivered as we continue to execute against our long term strategy and invest in areas that position us for sustainable growth.\nThrough our Total Home strategy, we were able to deliver continued pro growth this quarter, stacking on top of strong mid single digit growth in Q2 of last year. Additionally, we grew our online sales by 7.5%, partly driven by a more immersive shopping experience and increased traction for MyLowe's Rewards, which is helping us increase customer loyalty and drive repeat purchases. We also launched the first home improvement Creator Network with MrBeast, the world's most followed creator, among the first to join. This network is aimed at partnering with influencers across social media as trusted voices to drive brand engagement for our products and services. We're excited to see how our new Creator Network will enhance our connection with Gen Z and Millennial customers.\nWe're also continuing our marketing partnership with Lionel Messi, widely recognized as the best soccer player in the world, as well as our sponsorship of the NFL as the official home improvement partner. Turning to the macro environment, homeowners remain financially healthy, supported by strong balance sheets, wage growth, and low unemployment. The medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive, driven by an aging housing stock which is at a record high, substantial homeowner equity, and the pent-up demand from delayed projects. In fact, industry analysts estimate that there's roughly $50 billion of deferred project demand as many homeowners have delayed larger discretionary projects over the past few years. At the same time, an estimated 18 million new homes are needed by 2033. Together, these trends point to a healthy pipeline of demand for home improvement and new home construction ahead.\nThat's why we're confident that our most recent investments and acquisitions will uniquely position us to accelerate sales growth when the market turns. Before closing, I would like to officially welcome the Artisan Design Group or ADG team to Lowe's. We closed on this acquisition in June, and we believe the future combination of ADG and FBM under the same umbrella will position Lowe's to offer large Pro customers a full complement of interior finishes to meet their needs. I also want to thank our Lowe's frontline associates for their commitment to serving our customers day in and day out. I love spending time in the stores with our frontline associates who remain the driving force behind our company, and with that I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we delivered positive comps in nine of our 14 merchandise divisions, driven by continued growth in Pro and online, and a solid recovery in our spring seasonal categories. Starting in hardlines, we delivered positive comps in hardware, lawn and garden, and tools with widespread strength in key seasonal categories, especially as weather improved. We drove positive comps in lawn and garden, partly driven by a solid performance in live goods and the support of our growers as we navigated weather challenges early in the quarter. We also saw strength in Scotts soils and fertilizers as customers responded to their great offers. Turning to tools, we delivered strong performance in power tools and tool storage. Customers gravitated toward our robust assortment and compelling offers, including buy one get one free deals from brands like DeWalt, Craftsman, and Kobalt.\nOffers like these demonstrate our commitment to highlighting and delivering value for customers both online and in store. Turning to building products, we drove positive comps across building materials, rough plumbing, and lumber as we're seeing continuing momentum in repair and maintenance projects. We saw broad-based strength in interior categories like plumbing repair, water heaters, and drywall as well as in exterior categories like roofing, siding, and composite decking where we offer the top three brands in Trex, TimberTech, and Deckorators. In home decor, we delivered positive comps in painting, flooring, and appliances where we continue to build on our momentum with both positive sales dollars and unit comps this quarter along with driving sales growth in all major appliance categories. Lowe's continues to offer unmatched value in appliances with the broadest assortment and next-day delivery available in virtually every zip code in.\nThe US we're also pleased with our.\nOngoing efforts to build out our powerful Pro brand lineup, making sure that we have the brands and products that are most important to these customers. Over the last few years we've added brands like Klein Tools, Hubbell, Wallboard Tools, and more, and today we're excited to welcome Daltile to Lowe's, which is the best selling tile brand in the country and the Pro preferred choice for tile. Across residential and commercial projects, Daltile offers direct to home and job site delivery, ensuring materials arrive when and where they're needed. As Marvin mentioned, we remain focused on driving our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives throughout the business. One example, we have enhanced our assortment planning tools for seasonal buys over the last few years, which is allowing us to better anticipate demand and optimize our inventory allocation.\nThese enhancements have led to improved sell through and less end of season clearance and ultimately improvement in gross margin. This brings me to our approach to managing the global sourcing environment. I'm pleased that the teams are executing our playbook well and ensuring that we maintain strong assortments and excellent value for our customers with the goal of remaining price competitive. Our merchants are making great progress working closely with our suppliers to help mitigate cost pressures while ensuring a stable supply for our shared customers and accelerating our country of origin diversification to reduce our single country dependency in any given product category. So as I wrap up, I want to thank our merchant team as well as our MST associates and our vendor partners for their continued efforts to deliver the results. And now I'd like to turn the.\nCall over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThanks Bill, and good morning everyone. I want to start by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work and dedication. Their extensive knowledge of home improvement, relentless customer focus, and willingness to adopt new technology are driving measurable impact across the business. We're seeing that impact in higher customer satisfaction scores with significant improvements in the areas of associate helpfulness, and knowledge. These increases coincide with the rollout of MyLowe's Companion, our AI-powered app designed specifically to support associates on the sales floor. The app is helping new associates build competence early while enabling experienced associates to expand knowledge across departments. For example, a paint department associate in the garden center can use the app to instantly calculate how much mulch a customer needs and recommend the right tools for spreading it.\nAnd a hardware associate can help a customer in the appliance department quickly identify the most energy-efficient washer and dryer pair available under $1,500. We're pleased with the strong adoption rate, which has already surpassed our targets. And because the app is powered by AI, it has the capacity to learn from feedback and deliver even more helpful responses over time. Likewise, our customer satisfaction scores remain strong with the Pro, and as Marvin mentioned, we continue to see year-over-year growth in this segment, building on mid-single-digit gains in the second quarter of last year. In our recent Pros survey, Pros indicated they are confident in their near-term prospects with stable backlogs. Turning now to our Perpetual Productivity Improvement initiatives or PPI, let me provide an update on one of this year's key initiatives, streamlining our freight flow process.\nWe're using smarter truck organization, improved labeling, and redesigned carts, creating a more direct path from truck to shelf. These enhancements reduce unnecessary touch points and footsteps, reducing the overall time to complete these processes, which in turn creates payroll productivity. Finally, I'm excited to share that we opened three new stores this quarter in key growth markets North Fort Worth, Texas, Georgetown, Texas, and Maricopa, Arizona. Later this week we are set to open a location in Braselton, Georgia. New stores are outfitted with our latest enhancements and including an updated front end experience, optimized assortment, and upgraded technology to drive awareness and engagement in these new communities. We host MyLowe's Rewards Grand Opening events where we offer members exclusive to accelerate enrollment. I'd like to personally welcome the new teams from each of these stores and with that I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning. Beginning with our Q2 results, we generate a GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.27 in the quarter we closed on our acquisition of ADG and recognized $43 million in pre-tax transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments. Excluding these impacts, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.33, an increase of 5.6% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter of last year, we recorded a pretax gain of $43 million associated with the 2022 sale of our Canadian retail business. My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons that exclude these impacts where applicable.\nQ2 sales were $24 billion with comparable sales up 1.1% in the quarter, driven by recovery in seasonal categories as weather improved as well as continued strength in Pro online and appliances.\nMonthly comps were down 1% in May, up 0.3% in June, and in July we delivered positive transactions in comps up 4.7% for the quarter. Comparable average ticket increased 2.9% and comparable transactions declined 1.8%.\nAdjusted gross margin was 33.8% in the quarter, up 37 basis points from last year with improvements in both shrink and credit revenue as well as continued benefits from our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives. An adjusted SG&A of 17.3% of sales deleveraged 6 basis points in line with our expectations.\nAdjusted operating margin rate of 14.7% was up 23 basis points versus prior year, and the adjusted effective tax rate at 24.1% was in line with prior year results. Inventory ended Q2 at $16.3 billion, down $499 million versus prior year. We continue to manage our inventory replenishment in line with demand trends while also driving strong in stocks across both Pro and DIY categories. ADG operations did not have a material impact to our Q2 operating results.\nWe are pleased with our performance this quarter as the organization continued to navigate this uncertain environment while offering compelling value for our customers across our product assortments. The teams leaned into our best in class tools and processes to rapidly adjust to changing demand trends through the quarter and deliver on our operating commitments. Turning now to capital allocation, in Q2 we generated $3.7 billion in free cash flow inclusive of $495 million in capital expenditures, and we invested $1.3 billion for the acquisition of ADG. We paid $645 million in dividends at $1.15 per share, and announced a $0.05 per share increase to $1.20 per share for the dividend paid on 6 August, and we ended the quarter with adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.96 times, with $4.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and delivered a return on invested capital of 29.5%.\nNow turning to our financial outlook, our first half results actualized within our expected range of outcomes, and looking ahead, our expectations for a roughly flat home improvement market and the performance of our core business remain unchanged. The outlook assumes current consumer and home improvement trends persist and our strategic initiatives continue to drive momentum, especially in Pro and online.\nToday we are updating our full-year 2025 outlook only to reflect the inclusion of ADG. Taking this into account, we are now expecting sales in the range of $84.5 to 85.5 billion with comparable sales in a range of flat to up 1%. We also now expect full-year adjusted operating margin in a range of 12.2% to 12.3% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $12.20 to $12.45, and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion as we invest in the business and open new stores. Please note that this outlook does not include any potential impacts related to the acquisition of FBM. On an annualized basis, we expect ADG to negatively impact consolidated adjusted operating margin by approximately 15 basis points.\nNow, to assist you with your modeling, here are a few points to consider for Q3. We expect Q3 comp sales to be approximately 125 basis points above the bottom end of our full-year guide, and we also expect Q3 adjusted operating margin rate to be down approximately 20 basis points from prior-year adjusted operating margin rate, driven by ADG operating mix. In closing, we are confident our total home strategic initiatives are resonating with customers and that we are making the right investments, both organic and inorganic, to position the company for sustainable long-term sales growth and shareholder value creation. With that, I will hand the call back over to Marvin to discuss this morning's announcement regarding the acquisition of FBM.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Brandon. Over the last couple years we've been assessing potential new opportunities for growth within our industry. We evaluated a number of options including FBM. Since the beginning of this year, we met with the FBM management team many times and visited several of their sites across the country. We continue to be impressed not only with their industry expertise but also their strong focus on revenue growth which allowed them to seamlessly integrate multiple product verticals. We have now identified FBM as the right strategic fit for Lowe's to best complement our total home strategy and continue to position the company for long term sustainable growth. I'd like to start by highlighting their core strength and then I'll walk through the strategic rationale for this acquisition.\nAs you can see on slides six and seven, FBM has a proven 14-year track record of growth and a strong reputation with both the residential home builder and with commercial pros across new construction and repair and remodel applications. FBM has a diversified customer base in its commercial business, including hospitals, data centers, and office buildings. This mix creates more stability and better insulates the company from the ups and downs of the housing cycle. FBM also achieved scale the right way both as a disciplined buyer and builder, and since its inception in 2011, the company has successfully integrated more than 60 acquisitions across multiple product verticals and opened more than 50 greenfield locations. The result? A purpose-built, highly scalable multi-trade distribution platform. Today FBM is a leader in drywall sealing systems and metal framing.\nWith an established presence, loyal customer base, and a highly effective sales force that optimizes advanced selling tools to drive engagement and conversion. One of the most compelling aspects of the FBM acquisition is the strategic presence in key geographies such as California, the Northeast, and the Midwest regions where we currently have less of a presence. This provides us with significant growth opportunities to expand our Pro footprint and capture sales in these areas of dense population. With over 370 branches across the US, and Canada, FBM's extensive network is both expansive and highly complementary to our existing operations, further enhancing our ability to scale and drive long-term growth.\nOver the years, FBM has built a strong financial profile with consistent, profitable growth, and from 2019 through 2024, FBM drove revenue CAGR of approximately 25% and adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 30% through a combination of acquisitions, organic growth, and greenfield expansions. This impressive track record outperformed their public peers in Pro distribution over this time frame. Now moving to slide 8, FBM is led by talented industry veterans at every level of the organization. Founder and CEO Ruben Mendoza started with a single branch 14 years ago and built an industry-leading platform. He has a proven history of attracting and retaining top talent, and a leadership team that's been with FBM for roughly a decade on average.\nThis leadership team brings a disciplined approach to execution and an extensive base of 40,000 Pro customers, and like us, they focus on continuous improvement while always putting the customer first, and we're excited to welcome them to Lowe's and look forward to working with them as they continue to lead this business. Now I'd like to spend a moment on the strategic rationale for this acquisition on slide 9. You can see how this deal strengthens Lowe's position and why we're so enthusiastic about the opportunity ahead. First, this acquisition enhances our offering for Pro customers and expands our capabilities in a number of ways. We'll have faster fulfillment for larger deliveries as we use FBM's capabilities to expand job site delivery for Lowe's. We'll also expand our combined product offerings to both FBM and Lowe's Pro customers as we build on strong vendor relationships across both companies.\nIn the short run, we plan to add key FBM products along with their fulfillment capabilities to the Pro Extended Aisle in our Lowe's stores. We'll bring the catalog of Lowe's key Pro SKUs to FBM's Pro customers to drive greater attachment of Lowe's complementary products. Further, we'll strengthen our Pro digital tools by using the MyFBM mobile app, which offers real-time pricing, ordering, and delivery tracking for complex orders and is available in both English and Spanish. In addition, we plan to use FBM's AI blueprint takeoff technology to enhance our offering at our Lowe's store Pro Desk, which will automatically extract material quantities and measurements from digital construction plans, significantly accelerating the speed and accuracy of the estimating process, and will enhance our trade credit offering, which will be helpful for pros shopping our stores for larger projects.\nSecond, this acquisition gives us the opportunity to create a platform for ongoing growth and Pro distribution over the long term. We plan to utilize FBM's successful integration playbook, including a rapid transition to a single ERP platform. This will position Lowe's for continued growth across key market product categories. Also, as I mentioned earlier, with our recent acquisition of ADG, we're excited to see how quickly both FBM and ADG will allow us to offer our customers a best-in-class comprehensive interior solutions platform as outlined on slide 10. With an estimated 18 million new homes needed by 2033, we envision incorporating the products and services from each company to provide large Pro customers with everything from drywall to ceiling systems, insulation to doors, as well as flooring, cabinets, and countertops.\nWhile we continue to serve our DIY and small to medium Pro customers through our stores and online, we are confident that operating both FBM and ADG under the same umbrella will help us offer differentiated products and services for the large Pro's plan spend. And finally, this acquisition marks the next step in our multi-year strategy to transform our Pro offering, and it helps us deepen our reach with Pro customers, and it unlocks our ability to serve larger pros within this $250 billion total addressable market. It will increase our Pro penetration while allowing us to better balance our DIY and Pro revenue streams, resulting in sustainable long-term sales growth. Taken together, these moves will allow us to serve Pros more comprehensively, achieving greater scale through our distribution network, and move with greater speed and flexibility than ever before.\nIn closing, we couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for Lowe's as we combine forces with FBM. This acquisition will diversify our revenue streams and allow us to deliver long term value to our shareholders. With that I'd like to turn it over to Brandon who will tell you more about the transaction details.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks Marvin. This is a great day at Lowe's as we announced this exciting transaction that will not only enhance our Pro offering but also better position the company for long-term sustainable sales and profit expansion. The transaction details are outlined on slide 11 and include a purchase price of $8.8 billion, which reflects an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 13.4 times. The acquisition is expected to close in Q4 2025. Subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals, it's expected to be accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter full year after closing, excluding synergies. We intend to fund the acquisition through a combination of short-term and long-term debt.\nWe expect that the robust cash flow generation of our core business combined with FBM's track record of strong cash flows will allow us to delever quickly down to our target ratio by the end of Q2 2027.\nWe also plan to pause share repurchases. Until that time, we intend to maintain our solid investment grade credit ratings of BBB and Baa1. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest first in growth to support our 35% dividend payout target and return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. As Marvin mentioned, the FBM team has delivered consistent profitable growth since its founding in 2024. On a pro forma basis, FBM generated approximately $6.5 billion in revenue and $635 million in EBITDA. Looking ahead, we expect that FBM will continue to grow organically and through greenfield expansion in the near term. We also expect to drive incremental revenue and EBITDA with the cross selling opportunities that Marvin outlined through our combined product offering. We expect to deliver cost savings primarily by optimizing procurement, administrative, and logistics spend.\nIn closing, this transaction will strengthen our competitive position, accelerate the execution of our long-term strategy, and further position the company for the expected market recovery. This in turn will create meaningful, lasting value for our shareholders. With that, we'll open it up for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question today, please press Star one from your telephone keypad and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please for our first question.\nThank you.\nThe first question today is from the line of Stephen Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nGood morning everyone. Marvin, curious if you could expand on Foundation's year-to-date performance in 2025 given its pretty impressive growth track record for both sales and EBITDA, and then comment on what percentage of the 33,000 SKUs will be net new to the broader Lowe's offering?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey, Steve. Good morning. Those are good questions on their year-to-date performance. We're not going to get into that level of detail until after we close the transaction. I can tell you we're very excited, and we're excited about the historical trends in their performance from a sales, EBITDA, and profit performance. Again, we think they're the best player in the sector, and it's one of the reasons why we were attracted to them relative to the SKUs. Again, a little too early for us to get into that level of detail, but as Brandon and I both outlined in our prepared comments, we see an immediate benefit of Lowe's providing complementary attachment products to their large Pro customers.\nAnd through our Pro desk, we just feel like that we have significant opportunities to get their products, their fulfillment capabilities connected to our customers, and we think that's going to give us short-term benefits as we work through this entire process.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSteven, I would just add on the revenue side we do believe meaningful synergy opportunities here. We think there's significant cross-selling opportunities. Marvin mentioned FBM's got a broader product offering, certain core categories that they carry: drywall, ceilings, metal framing, insulation. Our Pro Extended Aisle infrastructure that we've been building should allow us to quickly plug that in and access that across our stores, our MSAs. And then on the flip side, Lowe's has our broader product offering and complementary categories that we believe can help FBM drive greater attachment, and examples there: tools, safety equipment, you know, fasteners. That's a very small percentage of what FBM's revenue mix is today. We think we can expand that further and more meaningfully.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThen, as a follow-up.\nWe sort of explore Foundation solutions on their website. It looks like.\nOrder management, Drake Trade Credit offering are.\nSome of their highlights.\nCurious, Marvin, and just get your initial thoughts on what those sort of solutions or offerings can mean for the broader Lowe's experience among the current Pro customer base.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThat's one of the reasons why we selected them as the acquisition target. They have a very effective transformation process relative to how quickly they can convert their own roll-ups on their ERP platform. So they have a consistent company-wide ERP which makes it a lot easier for us from a synergistic and integration perspective. In addition to that, we talked about their AI-driven blueprint takeoff technology which is the best I've ever seen and we think we can immediately plug that in to every Pro desk in our 1,750-plus stores.\nAnd as Brandon mentioned, the ability to get them connected to our endless aisle at our Pro desk from a product and fulfillment standpoint, we think, will immediately benefit some of our medium Pro customers and some of the large customers that come in and we can't service at a high level. And their My FBM mobile app is best in class. It provides real-time view of pricing, inventory, availability, order deliveries, and that's also something we believe we can quickly plug in to our Pro desk. So the key for us was we really believe that FBM could complement us from a large, complex pre plan Pro, which is where we have capability needs. But we were even more attracted that FBM can help us in our 1,750 store Pro desk with our small to medium Pro with some of the capabilities that they have.\nNot to mention, as I stated in my prepared comments, when you look at their geographic footprint, they have a dominant presence in California, which is their home base. They have a dominant presence in the Northeast and in the key metro markets in the Midwest. And these are areas that we have the least amount of store density. And being able to have a pro presence in these densely populated urban areas is something that Lowe's has been trying to accomplish for a couple of decades. So we think this acquisition gives us ability to start to build from there.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Baird\n\nOh, hey guys, good morning.\nThanks for taking the question.\nI'm going to stay with the core Lowe's business for now.\nThe first question, I mean, you guys do a pro sentiment survey every quarter.\nYou mentioned the stable backlogs, but I'm wondering if you can kind of expand on that. Anything else you got from those surveys this time around? Anything around labor availability or anything else?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThat you would call out? That's my first question. Yeah. So, Pete, I think at a high level, the pros, again, they reinforce the stable backlogs and that their business and their backlogs are healthy. Over 75% of the pros stated they were confident in their job prospects, which again, is consistent with what we've heard in past quarters. But they're also advising us they continue to concentrate on smaller projects, especially repair, remodel, and maintenance, which again, is what we're seeing. And then the small to medium Pro, which has been our sweet spot, you know, from a customer segment, you know, that's been the pivot for them with this lock-in effect, with very low housing turnover. The only concern they gave us is, you know, labor costs are going up them.\nAnd so one of the reasons why Lowe's is one of the champions in the Business Roundtable of trying to create these skilled trade jobs in the country. There's becoming more and more of a shortage of skilled trades, master plumbers, carpentry, electricians, and we're starting to see that pop up in different parts of the country. But overall, our pros feel really good about their prospects for the balance of the year, and that bodes well for us to continue to take share with the small to medium customer.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Baird\n\nThat's great.\nThat's helpful.\nMy follow up question is on the flooring category. It was called out as being a.\nPositive in the quarter. Maybe just talk about what's happening in.\nFlooring, which is something you're doing, something.\nYou're seeing more broadly.\nJust maybe expand on that a little bit. Thanks very much.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Peter, thanks for the question. We saw strength in our flooring business, really across a couple of key segments, across carpets, our soft surface business, as well as our tile business and adhesives, as we look at our strength with our pro customer. And so a nice blend of both DIY and pro business within our tile and flooring program, as well as our carpet program. And then we're also excited, as we announced in my prepared remarks, about bringing Daltile to Lowe's. And so that's a significant brand of tile for us to be able to get access to for both the do it yourself and a pro customer. And we're excited about what they bring to our program as we continue to strengthen what we're doing in flooring.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nAnd Peter, I'll just add, we're also very pleased with our central selling. As you can remember, flooring was our first category that we centralized for selling. This has really freed up our Red Vest associates to really stay focused on the customer in improving the LTR for installations. So we're making nice progress there as well.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Baird\n\nGreat. That's helpful.\nThanks so much, guys. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next questions come from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, guys, good morning. Thanks for all the detail today. Just on this transformational deal, can you give us some of the customer numbers or maybe the makeup of those customers with what size they are in terms of annual revenues? And then also within that, is there one specific capability that you see the most opportunity from, whether it's delivery or trade credit? Where can that be most exciting for Lowe's, especially porting over to the core business?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, David, I'll hit the customer piece first. Really a diverse and highly fragmented base. They have about 40,000 customers, and that's across the US, Canada. And just from a concentration standpoint, no single customer accounts for more than 1% of the revenue. So really when we look at the base, little to no concentration risk. And I would also mention, you know, we really like the mix of the business.\nOverall.\nIt's about 45% residential. So that serves both single family, multifamily, 55% commercial, which is split between new construction, repair, remodel. And we believe this balance lends itself to diversification, provides that balance to our overall portfolio, and specifically on the commercial side, less cyclicality and more of a sub-end market diversification. So like the mix of the business overall and again, little to no concentration risk from a customer standpoint. Marvin, I'll toss the second part of.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThat over to you.\nYeah.\nAnd look, the only thing I'll add, we talked about the combination of FBM and ADG, our previous acquisition. What's interesting is that in some cases when it comes to single-family construction, they serve the same large customer, but they provide totally different solutions. We just have this vision that we can take ADG's core business model which focuses on countertops, cabinets, flooring products, and install and then you combine that with FBM and we just envision having the ability to provide drywall, ceiling systems, insulation, doors, flooring, cabinets, and countertops all for one large customer. We think that's going to be incredibly beneficial to the large single-family, multifamily construction company and customer.\nWe think this company is something that is one of the reasons why we were attracted to make this acquisition with the hopes that we could put these two companies together.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nGot it.\nThanks for all that. And I also wanted to pivot over to the guidance and what's implied in the back half. A bit of an acceleration in same store sales growth. Can you just help us understand how much of that is due to pricing? We have noticed some incremental price increases across the store. So is that fully embedded within the back half or is that potential upside as we move through Q3 and Q4? Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nDavid.\nLet me. I'll just hit the overall second-half kind of guidance assumptions overall. I'll start with the macro piece first, and I think expectations there are more of the same as we look at the second half of our year. We're still working through some short-term challenges, including elevated mortgage rates. Cautious consumer affordability remains a pressure point that results in the lock-in effect that we've been seeing. Also a depressed housing market. So similar to what we said at the beginning of the year and back in May, we expect the overall home improvement market to be flat for the full year. That expectation continues. You know, when you look at the first-half results, we landed roughly where we expected outside some tough weather early in Q2, where we started slower through Memorial Day holiday, but it accelerated as.\nWe moved through July.\nReally nice, almost 5% exit rate there. A portion of July comp was driven by the seasonal shift, but we also saw solid performance in both Pro and DIY in Q2. So as we turn the page to the second half, our outlook really is unchanged since the beginning of the year. The range implies flat to 2.5% comp. We expect that to be split evenly across Q3 and Q4. We expected gradual improvements in the underlying business as we move through the year. That's both on a one- and two-year comp basis. Then we continue to expect to see benefits from our total home initiatives, total home strategy, as that ramps across the back half of the year. That's both in the Pro space and the DIY space.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nAnd David, this is Marvin, specific to pricing. We said in our previous earnings call that we would maintain a portfolio approach, we would be price competitive, and that's exactly what we've done in Q2. That's what we're continuing to do in the back half of the year. Prices in retail will always be dynamic. Prices will fluctuate up, down through various categories based on competitive responses, internal algorithms. It's not like the old days where you're manually changing prices. A lot of this is systemic and we feel like we have best in class tools to manage that exceptionally well. And we've been very transparent about that and that's how we're going to manage it. We feel good about our promotional strategy as well. You look at some of the things that we were able to do with Bill's team for July 4th.\nWe were promotional, we drove great foot traffic. Bill talked about the positive unit comps and appliances as well as positive sales. Again, you can look at that and say it was a great value-oriented environment. We think that's going to be more of the same for us for the back half of the year.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you both.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks.\nGood morning, everybody. So I'll follow up a bit on the weather question. You talked about $400 million potentially shifting into the second quarter from the first quarter. Did all of that happen, and is it fair to say that weather was net neutral, or do you think it was maybe a tailwind or headwind in the second quarter? Especially think about the strength in July.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYes, Chris, I would say we realized the large majority of that $400 million. If you go back to the beginning of the year, the way we cadenced out Q1, Q2, we planned for more normal weather. Q2, we expected the seasonal shift of about $400 million. I would say with the exception of the couple of weeks around Memorial Day where it was slower because of the wet, colder weather. As we got into June and July, very much played out as expected. So really happy with engagement that we saw. We had great traffic in the store, as Marvin mentioned, great performance across our seasonal categories. Very much in line with our expectations.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Then on the acquisition side, my question is, is there sort of a secondary investment cycle that emerges in the core Lowe's supply chain as you build out larger Pro fulfillment operations to perhaps get ahead of the future revenues for the Pro plan purchase? Asked another way, does these acquisitions do sort of like the investment in fulfillment, branches, and warehouses grow with the business or do you see the need to take this $2.5 billion of capex and make a step up to become more aggressive and get ahead of future growth?\nThank you.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nIt's a really good question. As we look at it now, we're going to work on integrating and getting this deal closed. We do see in the future some smaller tuck-ins on specific verticals, but we don't have anything in our current sight to do another large acquisition like this one. But we do see continuous investment in this platform. This is in fact a platform that we purchased. One of the reasons why we chose FBM is because we love their ERP system. We love the verticals that they're in, as I mentioned. We love their geographic presence. We love the fact that they were one of the best technology platforms for a small company that I've ever witnessed, including how they embrace AI and how they're leveraging that in a way to simplify the job and drive some efficiency.\nWe believe that we can take this platform and we can leverage our annual CapEx spend and we can continue to build this out to create something that we think is going to be a very dominant, long-term sustainable revenue driver for us.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much. Have a great Labor Day.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question has come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, this is Zach on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. Does the comp inflection signal a turn in home improvement market overall or is it more of a weather and seasonal bounce at the end of the quarter?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYes, again, Zach, we're not expecting any sort of inflection from a macro standpoint. I mentioned more of the same as we look in the second half of the year. Similar challenges to how we build our guide at the beginning of the year. What we reinforced in May, that's still what we're seeing. Now again, second half, we always had a bit of a gradual improvement baked in. And then we also expect to see momentum and expect to take share in the second half as we scale our total home strategy initiatives. So that's really the difference in the expectation. First half versus second half.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. And then just as a follow-up, appreciate all the color on some of the strategic commentary. Maybe bigger picture. Can you comment on how Lowe's strategy is changing? It seems you're making a more concerted pivot into building products distribution, first with ADG and now with FBM. What is the vision here and what makes this pivot so compelling in your view, especially now?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo, Zach, this is Marvin. I think specifically for us. We started out with a focus on what we call retail fundamentals. Seven years ago, this company had a great balance sheet and a bad strategy. And so we've been working really hard with a great leadership team and some, you know, really, really dedicated associates to get the foundation of this business shored up and to create efficiency. And I would argue that we are now one of the best operating large retailers in the world. But as we look forward and we look at our total home strategy, which this acquisition and these two acquisitions totally support, the question was really simple. When housing recovers, where will the inflection happen in what categories and what parts of the business do we think will see the greatest growth from that inflection?\nAs we research this in great detail, we believe that we had some strategic deficits in how we could take advantage of the inflection that we think will be coming in housing. We talked about these pent-up demand projects. We talked about 18 million homes needed by 2033. We were not positioned as a company to take advantage of that. We didn't want to be sitting on the sidelines. So the two acquisitions that we made tie perfectly into what we are projecting will be the inflection point for housing, home improvement in this overall macro environment. That is single-family, multi-family construction in addition to repair, remodel, and having these capabilities to do this in a very efficient way. It's not a change in strategy; it's an evolution in strategy. Our total home strategy basically outlined that to a T.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good luck.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please receive your questions.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question, Marvin. It seems like this Pro plan purchase segment of the market is in the early stages of consolidation, and Lowe's is bringing together several assets combined with the power of its existing platform to gain its first share of that market. In your mind, is that sufficient enough to be able to harvest a very suitable return on these investments that you've been making? Do you think these assets combined with Lowe's need to have a differentiated strategy, a differentiated position in the market as this consolidation unfolds in order to earn a compelling return? Thank you very much.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, Michael, thank you for the question. I think for us, we believe the combination of FBM and ADG does in fact create differentiation. We're excited about the possibility of leveraging both these platforms. When you combine them together, it gives us a real opportunity to go after this $250 billion total addressable market. You know, as I mentioned before, we have a vision that we'll be able to go to a customer and provide them everything from drywall, ceiling systems, insulation, doors, flooring, cabinets, and countertops. There's no other player that can walk into a large single family home builder, a large multi family home builder, and create that type of proposition and do it with advanced technology. And so it is our expectation and our goal that we're going to build out.\nAn offering, a solution, and fulfillment capabilities that will allow us to have differentiation in the space I just outlined.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot you.\nMy follow up question is, if we are on the precipice of this recovery in home improvement, how does Lowe's ensure that all of the heavy lifting associated with integrating these assets that are being brought together does not interfere with Lowe's ability to harvest the recovery or gain its fair share as the recovery unfolds?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's",
    "content2": "No, Michael, it's another very fair question. I think it just comes down to organizational structure and commitment to execution. We have separate integration teams that are working on ADG and FBM. We have separate teams working on these strategic initiatives that will create the synergies that Brandon outlined. We're not going to get distracted in the core business. Everyone sitting at this table, and everyone on the senior leadership team at Lowe's, understands how we create shareholder value. We're going to be really focused on those total home strategy initiatives that we talk so much about, on our PPI initiatives that you hear us update you on every quarter. My commitment to the shareholders is that we're not going to get distracted.\nWe have separate teams managing these two exciting acquisitions, but we also have the core team focus on the Lowe's business, which we know is the key to our success long term.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much. Good luck.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey guys, good morning.\nCongratulations.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nMy first question, I guess, is on the trend of business. Clearly, comp sales accelerated as the quarter progressed.\nWe discussed that.\nI guess the question I want to ask is was there anything notable geographically.\nMaybe to help us break out, break apart the benefits of normalizing or improving weather through the period versus maybe some true underlying improvements in underlying demand?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nBrian, I would say geographically, the only anomalies that we saw were hurricane overlaps, which create some degree of negative comps in certain geographies in addition to weather. Brandon mentioned, and it is well noted, that Memorial selling period was not great from a weather perspective, but it impacted certain geographies worse than others. Other than that, as you can imagine, we're paying really, really close attention to all things macro, all things housing, all things governmental policies to determine if we're seeing any material impacts to certain geographies. To date, there's nothing material that I can speak to.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThat's helpful, Marvin. My second question, I guess bigger picture, broader, you know, just with respect to tariffs of trade. If I hear you correctly, I mean, we were saying that, you know, Lowe's is managing the business and you take a portfolio, post a price, and you're doing what you have to do. You know, is there anything changing competitively? I mean, and I guess the question I'm trying to ask is the Lowe's.\nIs obviously one of the key skilled.\nPlayers within the space, but you, as these price adjustments are taking hold, these tariffs are taking hold, do.\nYou see, do you see an opportunity?\nFor Lowe's to be able to take even more market share than it had historically, given its position as a skilled player?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYou know, Brian, it's a good question. As you can imagine, it's something we spend a lot of time talking about. I think if you look at this at a really high level, it comes down to the customer segment that you're serving and how you can best serve that customer segment in this current environment.\nWe have done, in my estimation, an excellent job of working cross functionally relative to looking for diversification. I mean, right now, roughly 60% of the goods we source are coming out of the US, and it wasn't that way seven years ago. You know, China's at 20%, but it was a lot higher than that seven years ago. Bill's team, they're taking methodical, really, really business savvy steps to just keep us from being so overly dependent on one country of origin. Having said that, as I said earlier, pricing is incredibly dynamic and is driven a lot by a set of business rules that we have internally based on competitive pricing and based on our own internal data on elasticity. We understand what our customers want and what they don't want.\nWe understand the breakpoint on units when you start to price in a way that you see demand go down. We're managing this literally real time, because this is uncharted waters. Because we dealt with this before, years back when we didn't have great data and systems, the team is really efficient at managing it now that we have superior systems. That's a long-winded answer that may not, you know, have given you a direct response to the question, but it's a dynamic environment. We're paying close attention to it, and we are absolutely trying to take share. We think what we were able to do, you know, in the second quarter when the weather improved, is an example that we are taking share and that we're making the smart decisions that can give customers a reason to shop us versus the competition.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGot it.\nI appreciate all the color.\nThank you.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nSenior Vice President, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my questions. My first one was on FBM. I wanted to double click on the faster fulfillment that could be realized here, and just wanted to see if you could frame maybe the improvement in speed that Pro customers may potentially enjoy from FBM and Lowe's joining forces. Wasn't sure if there's a way to understand, you know, time to serve today versus what could happen pro forma for this deal. That was my first question.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Jonathan, it's one of the things we're really excited about. You know, as an example, one, FBM's core competency is drywall. They sell a lot of it and they can deliver it to multiple floors. If a customer comes into one of our stores today and we sell, just to keep it simple, a flatbed of drywall, getting that sale received and delivered is a really, really painful process. Today, with this partnership with FBM, through our endless aisle technology, we literally can get that sale sent over to them electronically. They can pick it and fulfill it within 24 hours or less. It's all about the geography.\nAs I mentioned earlier, one of the most compelling reasons for this acquisition is where their geographic footprint is, in places where we don't have a dense population of stores, primarily California, the Northeast, and these urban areas in the Midwest. This will be critical for us to not only drive Pro sales from the physical Lowe's stores in those locations, but to get salespeople on the ground in those locations to drive sales where we just don't have the density and scale right now. The efficiency and fulfillment is going to be exponentially better.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nUnderstood. A quick follow up. You unveiled plans for the marketplace earlier this year. I think the initiative is still early days, but maybe, Brandon, if you could dream the dream, how would you frame the working capital and inventory efficiencies that can materialize over time with a scaled 3P marketplace? Thanks.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Jonathan, thanks for the question. I would say as it relates to our marketplace, continue to be very excited about the progress we're making. We're seeing expanded breadth of product offering across various price points. We're able to offer value to premium. We spoke back in May about the launch of the Mirakl platform. We're making really good progress adding vendors to the platform, and very much rolling this out in a pace that meets our expectations. I wouldn't say right at this point in time we have specific expectations around working capital or anything like that, but expect over the long term beyond 2025 for this to be a meaningful contributor to our online offering and what we're able to do through our total home strategy. Rob, with that, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That final question will come from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please receive your questions.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Congrats on the acquisition. First question was on the margin impact from buying this asset.\nGiven the difference in the business.\nModel, what should we expect as a preliminary view of kind of gross margin and EBIT margin rate by adding FBM? Then bigger picture, how does this impact some of your longer term financial targets? In the past you've talked about reaching an operating margin of kind of 14.5% with a line of sight to 15%. Does this signal that margin dollars kind of matter more than margin rate in the next couple of years?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYes, Steve, you know, thank you for the question. I think as it relates to financial expectations, I'll say first and foremost we expect FBM acquisition to help us deliver more sustainable long-term sales growth, and that's going to come with deeper Pro penetration, especially in Pro plan spend. Marvin talked at length about our ability to access the $250 billion large complex Pro TAM that we really don't get much access to today. That will translate, we believe, to increased operating profit. It's going to continue to support EPS growth over time. We're not going to specifically get into this point dilution or expectations as it relates to 2026.\nWe're going to provide an update after we close out FBM, and the exact timing will depend on that, but we expect to have more of an update there in November. As it relates to the second part of the question on the long-term targets, right now we're sticking with and focused on 2025 and delivering on those commitments, showing our ability to do that, manage profitability really well, and any impacts from FBM on long-term targets. We're going to look forward to discussing that closer to the end of the year and as we start to look ahead to 2026.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay, understood. The follow up I had was on the capital allocation side. We saw that you paused the share repurchases to Q2 2027. Marvin, you alluded to the potential for more tuck-in M&A in the future now that you've done this acquisition. Should we expect cap share repurchases kind of take a back seat for the next couple years, and even when you return, we'd see a lower level of share repurchase activity?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYes, Steve, I'll take that. Very committed. As we've continued to reference to our 2.75x target in our existing credit rating, we are going to pay down debt aggressively here over the next couple of years to get back to that leverage target.\nOver the next two years, 2025, 2026, we do expect to temporarily pause our share repurchases, and we expect that to resume in 2027 once we get back to that leverage target. More broadly, as we look at trade-offs from this, again, our number one priority is to continue to invest in the business. That's been stated through our capital allocation philosophy. We're going to invest in the business for growth. We believe the FBM acquisition is going to unlock operating leverage, cost synergies, cross-selling opportunities, and over time we expect this will scale and ultimately drive stronger returns in line with our target range. Steven.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nMarvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nLast point, any tuck-ins that we do will be within our capital allocation framework and within our CapEx commitment for whatever time period that we're in. To Brandon's point, we're excited about this acquisition, we're excited about building out the platform, and we're also committed to paying down debt and getting back to our leverage target.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nUnderstood.

Welcome to Lowe's Companies' Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising. Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores. And Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's investor relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2024.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A, and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 sales were $21.4 billion, with comparable sales down 4.1% from the same period last year. Despite the continued pressure and DIY bigger ticket discretionary spending across the industry, we delivered better than expected spring seasonal sales. Overall, we performed well in a challenging home improvement environment as we adjusted our strategy to win the early spring customer and take share in key categories with data-driven marketing campaigns and our compelling seasonal assortment, which includes our industry-leading outdoor power equipment lineup strengthened by the launch of Toro.\nWe also gained traction with our Total Home Strategy, reflected in our positive Q1 growth in Pro and online sales. In addition, we improved customer satisfaction while also maintaining a disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, initiatives across all functional areas of the business. Overall, we're excited about our spring strategy, and we're pleased with how our SpringFest campaign resonated with customers, especially in smaller ticket lawn and garden projects. The combination of the right brands, compelling offers, strong store execution, and more nimble marketing helped us capitalize on this key time of year.\nBill and Joe will provide more detail on our spring and PPI efforts later in the call. Now, turning to Pro, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered positive Pro comps in Q1 as our strategic investments to improve the Pro experience are driving increased sales and improved customer engagement. Specifically, investments to improve service levels, as well as our expanded brand portfolio that now includes Klein Tools, are strengthening our relationships with this core customer. This customer has proven resilient, as reflected in the recent Pro survey, with healthy backlogs in line with last year.\nOur strategy continues to focus on taking share with the small to medium-sized pros, such as repair and remodel contractors, property managers, and tradespeople. We estimate these pros represent half of the $500 billion Pro market, which remains highly fragmented. We are striving to provide a high level of service with these small to medium-sized pros as we continue to build trust and credibility. We continue to invest in Pro growth, which includes expanding our capabilities to handle larger order delivery to the job site, while also opening new Lowe's Pro supply branches around the country.\nThere is still significant runway ahead of us to grow our sales with these customers, while also leveraging our retail footprint to drive profitability. Now, shifting to online, in Q1, online sales were up approximately 1%. Our ongoing improvement in our conversion rates in Q1 offset continued pressure in bigger ticket DIY categories. This quarter, we expanded our same-day delivery option by partnering with DoorDash and Shipt. Lowe's is the first home improvement retail partner on these platforms, and their members now have quick and convenient access to a wide assortment of home improvement products across the country.\nThese new partnerships complement our existing same-day delivery options with Instacart, in addition to our same-day delivery option on lowes.com using our last mile partner, OneRail. Our objective is simple: giving customers access to the home improvement products they need however they choose to shop. We're tailoring our digital experience to support the unique needs of different customer shopping journeys based on the type of project. We're also using virtual and mixed reality to make it easier for customers to explore and visualize different possibilities for their home.\nAnother exciting step forward for Lowe's this quarter was the national rollout of our DIY loyalty program called MyLowe's Rewards. This program is designed to reward customers for choosing Lowe's for their home improvement needs by earning points toward MyLowe's Money, providing free standard shipping, as well as other offers and gifts. In addition, customers can also save 5% every day on eligible purchases with the MyLowe's Rewards credit card. As MyLowe's Rewards program matures, the purchase data will allow us to better understand the specific needs of each customer and tailor offers to their individual preferences.\nWe're pleased with the early customer adoption and the successful launch both in store and online. Our frontline associates have also rallied around this campaign, and I'd like to thank them for their successful efforts to promote MyLowe's Rewards and educate our customers on the benefits. Now, speaking of team, we're excited to welcome the best soccer player in the world, Lionel Messi, to our Lowe's home team lineup. We're also extending our reach to more sports fans. Beyond the football fans we connect with as the official home improvement retailer of the NFL, we're now striving to reach the 34 million soccer fans in the US who are not NFL fans, and we're excited by the rapid growth of soccer fans in the US.\nThis exciting alliance, along with our partnership with MLS club Inter Miami CF, and the Copa América 2024 USA tournament, gives us the opportunity to build trust and credibility with a broader customer base. These partnerships will help us bring new customers to Lowe's and offer some unique experiences and rewards for these very passionate fans. Now, I'd like to provide a quick update on our view of the macro. Uncertainty around interest rate cuts, stubborn inflationary pressures, and a consumer still showing a preference toward spending on discretionary services and experiences continue to weigh on the DIY home improvement demand.\nThe outlook for lower mortgage rates and improved housing turnover remains uncertain. Real wage growth and home price appreciation are solid, but the home improvement customer is still on the sideline, expressing concerns about higher cost of living and the state of the overall economy. While the near term is still challenging to read, we remain confident in the medium to long-term outlook for our industry, as our core demand drivers are all supportive of growth.\nOur continued commitment on our PPI initiatives, combined with our ongoing investments in our Total Home Strategy, not only allow us to perform efficiently in this challenging macro environment, it also positions Lowe's for accelerated market share growth when the home improvement market recovers. Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our frontline associates for their continued hard work and commitment to Lowe's and to our communities. I visited stores in eight of our 15 geographic regions in the Q1 and our frontline associates are simply outstanding. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In spite of a challenging home improvement backdrop in Q1, we are pleased with our early spring sales as customers responded to our strong spring assortment and compelling offers. And our approved brand and service offerings resonated with our Pro customers, which led to positive, broad-based Pro comps across all three geographic divisions. This year, our SpringFest strategy went more local than ever by using weather-triggered digital marketing as the spring season broke across different regions.\nIn Q1, we also introduced sneak peeks for SpringFest, featuring doorbusters that were focused on driving traffic into our stores and online with targeted offers with seasonally relevant categories such as soils, mulch, and live goods. Winning the customer with these early seasonal purchases is important as they will often come back multiple times throughout the spring for the remainder of their outdoor project needs. Now, turning to our results in hardlines. These marketing efforts, paired with the right brands and strong execution, helped us deliver positive comp sales on a one-year and two-year basis in lawn and garden.\nGrowth was driven by smaller ticket projects in landscape products and live goods, which resulted in increases in both comp sales and transactions in these categories. We are also pleased to be gaining traction with our own Sta-Green private brand, as customers have responded to the quality and the value offered in these lawn and care products. Sta-Green helps provide the consumer with a beautiful lawn that they can be proud of at a price that won't break the bank. For the first time this spring, customers can also purchase select plants and live goods online and have them delivered through lowes.com.\nGarden products are already some of the most searched items on our website, and now customers can conveniently shop for what they need and even order them from their backyard. As Marvin mentioned, we are excited about our powerful new spring outdoor power equipment lineup as we introduce Toro to our lineup this year. Lowe's now offers the largest selection of Toro products of any national retailer with innovations like SmartStow, which allows owners to store their mower upright, reducing the storage footprint by up to 70%, including patented Briggs & Stratton technology so it doesn't leak oil when stored in this position, and with Personal Pace, a best-in-class self-propelled system that propels the mower at the speed the user is walking.\nWe added these innovative Toro products to an already unmatched brand arsenal, which included EGO, SKIL, Kobalt, Husqvarna, CRAFTSMAN, and John Deere. These strong brands helped us deliver positive comp sales in both gas and battery-powered walk-behind lawnmowers, as well as handheld outdoor power equipment. Now, shifting gears to building products. Our Pro customers remain busy, which supported positive comps in building materials with strength in roofing, concrete and block, drywall, and insulation, all helping to fuel that growth.\nOur added focus on inventory depth and improved in-stocks, along with our localization efforts with tailored assortments to the market, continue to give Pro customers the confidence that Lowe's will have what they need to complete the job. Repair and maintenance categories such as water heaters also continue to perform well, especially with innovative products like A.O. Smith's 120-volt plug-in heat pump water heaters. These ENERGY STAR certified models plug into a standard wall outlet for easy installation and can save homeowners over $600 a year in utility bills compared to a standard electric water heater.\nIn electrical, we are pleased with the performance of Klein Tools, the number one tool brand for the electrical and HVAC professional. New products like the Klein Circuit Breaker Finder make it easy for electricians to quickly identify which breakers and outlets are connected to the breaker panel without turning the breaker on and off. The introduction and expansion of brands like Klein Tools not only drive sales, it also allows us to rebuild the credibility with our Pro customers. Turning to home decor, where softer demand in DIY bigger ticket interior categories like flooring, kitchens, bath, and appliances persisted.\nTrends in these categories were largely in line with the results we saw in the second half of last year. Our customers continue to look for value, especially given the persistent Harlow Kitchen Faucet, which is simple to install with three easy steps. And what is really unique, you don't have to go below the sink to install it. Our STAINMASTER PetProtect carpet with leak defense backing helps prevent spills and keeps pet accidents from seeping through to the rug pad or subfloor. STAINMASTER is the most trusted brand in carpet and is exclusive to Lowe's.\nTurning to appliances, we are expanding our market share as we continue to lead the industry with the broadest assortment, compelling values, and fast and convenient delivery supported by our market delivery model, which creates a best-in-class fulfillment solution, including next-day delivery in most markets, which is an important option for a customer replacing a broken appliance. Average selling prices remain pressured as we cycle the reintroduction of pre-pandemic promotions across the industry, as well as the continued slowdown in discretionary demand.\nDespite these near-term challenges, our appliance suppliers continue to improve selection with innovation and amazing new products. A great example is the Lowe's exclusive GE Freestanding Range with EasyWash, a range with a first-of-its-kind removable oven liner that is dishwasher-safe, making for easy cleanup. Moving on to merchandising productivity, our teams are continuing to execute against our extensive perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, roadmap. This quarter, I'd like to highlight the productivity benefits of one initiative, the progress we've made in expanding our private brand penetration.\nThe core focus of our private brand strategy is to offer our brand-agnostic DIY customers with style and quality at a great value. Not only do these products provide this for our customers, the product margin rates for our private branded products are typically significantly higher on average compared to the national brand counterparts. As we build out a compelling private brand portfolio from Allen + Roth decor products, and STAINMASTER products within flooring and paint, to Sta-Green lawn care products, to Kobalt Tools outdoor power equipment, and storage solutions, we are delivering value to the DIY customer and productivity to the bottom line.\nAs I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation once again to our vendors for their ongoing partnership, in particular their support of our merchandising services team. Our 30,000 MST associates keep our shelves stocked, execute resets, and enable our Red Vest associates to spend more time serving our customers. We allocate 100% of our MST funds into this program and are pleased with the impact it is having on our customer experience and associate productivity. I'd also like to thank our merchants for their hard work and dedication as they navigate this dynamic macro environment. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work this quarter. Customer satisfaction scores were up 100 basis points over last year as we continue to improve our shopping experience for homeowners and pros, while at the same time driving productivity across our company. As we improve our customer's experience, we also remain focused on our associates' experience and our journey to become the employer of choice in retail.\nAn example of our commitment to our associates was our decision to close our stores on Easter for the fifth consecutive year, giving our associates a well-deserved day off to spend with their loved ones, one of many ways we work to show our appreciation. We are seeing strong spring staffing levels and higher retention as we continue to invest in wages, associate development, and internal mobility. We have a best-in-class leadership development training program, including a store replica at our Lowe's University Training Center, which gives store leaders hands-on leadership practice and coaching.\nWe have also implemented new weekly routines that help our department supervisors strengthen the selling culture and skill set in their stores and prepare these leaders for the next step in their career. As a reminder, more than 80% of our store leadership positions were filled internally last year, and nearly 90% of our store leaders started in hourly roles. Another way we are strengthening our selling culture is through our modernized store operating system, which is enabling our associates to close omnichannel sales from within our stores and help customers get everything they came for.\nSo when a customer is looking for something out of stock or can't find the specific style they want in store, our associates can search our online assortment to find what they need and help them seamlessly check out an order that combines in-store and online items. Beyond supporting sales, our store teams remain laser-focused on driving productivity. A common misconception that we are hearing is that Lowe's must be nearing the end of our productivity journey, given how much progress we've made in the last five years. This couldn't be further from the truth. Since this can be hard to see from the outside looking in, let me share some examples.\nFirst, we are only 1/3 of the way through our multi-year transformation of the front end of our stores, which includes our proprietary self-checkout registers, a significantly improved buy-online pickup and store experience, a streamlined returns process, and an optimized front-end selling space. Second, we have significantly reduced our return and cancellation rate through improved vendor partnerships, decreased damages, and a clear and consistent returns process that's now systematically applied through enhanced technology. Third, we are also enhancing our shrink prevention ecosystem to maintain our best-in-class shrink performance, including a new AI technology in partnership with NVIDIA that prompts customers to scan missed items during self-checkout.\nWe're also piloting new product protection with a product security door that unlocks with the customer's phone number instead of needing to find an associate with a traditional key. These are just a few examples from our extensive roadmap of PPI initiatives. Given the strong performance of our frontline associates this quarter, 93% of our stores qualified for our Winning Together quarterly bonus, which is designed specifically for our hourly associates. As we approach Memorial Day weekend, I want to thank our veterans. As a marine, I'm proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting our military community.\nLowe's ranks among the top military-friendly brands in the US with a 10% off everyday military discount, dedicated veteran parking spots, and nearly 26,000 associates from the military community. We work with the Department of Defense to bring our jobs directly to transitioning service members and military spouses, and have a program to provide training and work experience with Lowe's during their last months of service. We value the skills, dedication, and courageous leadership we see in our veterans. This Memorial Day, I hope you will join us in thanking our associates in camouflage vests for their service.\nIn closing, we are executing to deliver an even better experience for our customers and associates while unlocking even more productivity across our stores. With that, I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe. Starting with our Q1 results, we generated GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Please note, in Q1 last year, we recognized a gain of $63 million associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. As a result, my comments today will include comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year. Q1 sales were $21.4 billion, with comparable sales down 4.1% as improved seasonal weather combined with strong spring execution drove better-than-expected results. Comparable transactions declined 3.1% as homeowners continued to delay larger discretionary projects.\nComparable average ticket was down 1%, with shrink, then Pro partly offsetting the impacts of lower DIY big-ticket sales and ongoing appliance pricing pressure. Our monthly comps were down 6.7% in February, 4.9% in March, and 1.1% in April. Keep in mind, our monthly comp cadence was impacted by the earlier timing of Easter, which fell in March this year while it was in April last year. Because we close our stores on Easter, this pressured our March results by approximately 300 basis points and benefited April by the same amount.\nGross margin was 33.2% of sales in Q1, down 49 basis points from last year, largely driven by ongoing supply chain investments, early spring traffic driving promotions, and a modest decline in credit revenue. This was partly offset by lower transportation costs and ongoing PPI initiatives. SG&A was 18.8% of sales, down 137 basis points versus last year's adjusted SG&A, driven by sales deleverage as well as the cycling of a favorable legal settlement. These pressures were partly offset by PPI initiatives delivered by each functional team across the company.\nOperating margin of 12.4% declined 201 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 23.7%, largely in line with last year's adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $18.2 billion, $1.3 billion lower than last year as we continue to optimize replenishment to align with sales patterns and improve the efficiency of spring product flow. Turning to capital allocation, in the Q1, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures totaled $382 million as we continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We paid $633 million in dividends at $1.10 per share and repurchased 3 million shares for $743 million, returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders.\nWe ended Q1 at adjusted debt to EBITDA of 2.93x, and we delivered a return on invested capital above 32%. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, today we are affirming our full year 2024 outlook. We continue to expect sales ranging from $84 to 85 billion and comparable sales in a range of down 2% to down 3%, with Pro sales outpacing DIY. We expect operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.7% and full year earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30. To assist with your modeling, here are a few points to keep in mind for the cadence of the year.\nFirst, based on the trends we are seeing in the business, we expect Q2 comparable sales to be roughly in line with Q1. We continue to expect second half comp sales to improve as we cycle over easier compares from the DIY pullback that intensified in Q3 2023. As I mentioned on our last call, this is not because we are forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year. It's just that the compares are easier in the second half. In terms of flow through, we expect operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2, largely due to sales deleverage and cycling a favorable legal settlement.\nTaking these factors into account, we expect Q2 operating margin rate to be approximately 150 basis points below the prior year rate and flow through of productivity to improve in the second half of the year. Before I close, I'd like to reiterate that our capital allocation strategy remains intact. First, reinvest in the business. Second, target a 35% dividend payout ratio. And third, return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2024, we plan to use our free cash flow to repay a $450 million bond maturity and then return the remaining cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In closing, we remain focused on investing in our Total Home Strategy.\nAs Marvin mentioned, we are also executing against a multi-year roadmap of PPI initiatives, which will continue to unlock productivity well beyond 2024. We are well positioned to capitalize on home improvement demand when the market recovers and continue to deliver sustainable shareholder value. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We are now ready for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press star two. In order to allow questions from as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question today comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nChristian Carlino\n\nEquity Research Associate, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good morning. It's Christian Carlino, on for Chris. Just to dig in on the gross margin, could you help us understand some of the drivers there? And are you seeing the full run rate of vendor clawbacks at this point, or does that build over the year? And just broadly, how should we think about the phasing of gross margin expansion over the year relative to the flat gross margin guide?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, sure. This is Brandon. Thanks for the question. So, as it relates to gross margins and we look out for the full year, we are still expecting gross margins to be flat. Our improvements, mainly PPI, we expect those to be more back half weighted. The headwinds, we had many of these in Q1, ongoing investments in our supply chain as we finalize the rollout of market delivery, early investments in our Pro fulfillment initiatives, and spring promos as we continue to execute on our everyday competitive pricing strategy. And then the tailwinds, a number of PPI efforts that we continue to execute against. Bill mentioned momentum that we're seeing in private brands, ongoing pricing initiatives. And then, as it relates to the clawback, we're making really nice progress there.\nDriving sales now, we're making some of that investment in price, and there's going to be a bit of a lagged effect as the new cost turns through inventory here over the next three quarters, and then also continuing to benefit from lower transportation costs as we leverage our scale to drive rates with our carriers. So, we also mentioned, credit, there's some first half pressure there related to higher borrowing costs and delinquencies as it relates to our private label credit portfolio, but we expect to be able to manage that roughly flat to the year. And then, great performance on the shrink side, we continue to expect roughly flat on the year there.\n\nChristian Carlino\n\nEquity Research Associate, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. I appreciate the color and the prepared remarks, but I guess how would you disaggregate some of the bigger ticket trends between more remodeling-oriented categories that are more likely financed versus others like big ticket seasonal and appliances? And how are you thinking about the recovery path for maybe these two sides of big ticket broadly?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, I think when we look at big ticket in particular, we continue to see pressure, right? We called out large tickets greater than 500, down 7.6% for the quarter. Most of that right now is still related to DIY, and we're continuing with the Q4 trends that we saw there where big ticket was down 8.8%. I think a lot of that, as we look at discretionary, there is some seasonal impact there as we continue to see some level of pressure from patio, from grills with multi-year replacement cycles. We are continuing to see pressure from appliances as we normalize against the promo environment. We get back to more 2019 levels.\nAnd then also the emerging dynamic with the lock-in effect and higher rates continues to pressure big ticket categories like kitchen and bath, decor, and flooring. Those are categories that are sensitive to higher interest rates and the new home occasion. Very much working through that. We're seeing offsets to that as we continue to drive the Pro business, and that helps boost some of our big ticket. We expect average ticket for the full year to continue to be roughly flat, but definitely continuing to work through some of the DIY pressures that we're experiencing.\n\nChristian Carlino\n\nEquity Research Associate, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Thank you very much. Best of luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next questions are from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGood morning, Marvin. Maybe a question for Joe, actually, on the front-end transformation. I was very curious if you could just update us on how you're sort of thinking about the ROI of that initiative. It sounds like it's progressing, and we're only 1/3 of the way through, but any color on sort of what the comp lift is or the waterfall benefit we should sort of think through as we work through the whole transformation here?\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nYeah. And so thanks for the question, Steve. We won't give the comp benefit, but there's several things that we're seeing. We have a detailed roadmap as we've laid out. We're 1/3 of the way through. And when I think about the proprietary self-checkout systems we've talked about in the past, the user-friendly for the home improvement customer, along with the partnership we have with our tech team under Seemantini's leadership, the teams work hand in hand.\nSo we're incorporating the technology that we spoke about, NVIDIA, our assisted self-checkout. And in addition, we just finished launching the ability for our gig drivers to pick up from our enhanced buy-online pickup in store and all of our gig delivery networks. So we're really pleased. And again, 1/3 of the way through, customer satisfaction scores have improved. The associate engagement has improved, and very pleased with where we're at.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nAnd, Steve. I'll just add, you mentioned we're only 1/3 of the way through, but we're really pleased with the benefits that we're seeing. We're not going to call out the comps, but just financially speaking, seeing higher sales as we're opening up space on the front end, lower payroll cost, improved returns as we've increased or improved that experience, and then the customer experience with the improved front end and BOPIS. Just as we look at all of our KPIs there, 1/3 of the way in, we're pleased with the progress there.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nAnd maybe just a follow-up as we approach Memorial Day here and think through categories like appliances and the change in the promotional sort of strategy away from bundles and sort of to a buy more, save more strategy. What are you sort of expecting from the consumer in terms of engagement and conversion? Is there any early reads that you're seeing or any way to sort of talk through how you sort of expect the consumer to engage here over the coming weeks?\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Steve, this is Bill. And so the trends we're seeing with appliances are very similar to what we've been seeing really over the last six to 12 months in that we've seen the consumer shift from buying multiple pieces to now single item pieces really in that durable market. And so that's where we've pivoted our efforts to making sure that we're meeting her where she wants to be met. And we're really pleased that we've continued in a down market to be able to drive units and pick up unit share during that timeframe. And so that's the efforts that you're going to see us drive as we go through Memorial Day and throughout the remainder of the year.\nWhen you look at what the appliance team is doing, we're also seeing great innovation, as I called out in my prepared remarks with a GE oven that I talked about. We've also talked about it before. You're seeing wherever we're putting innovation on the floor, you're seeing her respond to that type of product. That's really the difference that's going on today. You've got a value-conscious consumer that is opting in, and you've got a consumer that's not afraid to pay for innovation when that's offered to her as well. We want to make sure that we meet her where she wants to be met.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nHardline, Broadline and Food Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. I want to talk about the backdrop and any signs of normalization. If you can talk about traffic versus 2019, I know a big ticket is part of that. This is the third year of negative comps. I guess we are going to, I guess the model says we're going to see a turn by the end of the year. But Brandon, you mentioned that's not macro-dependent, that's more business-dependent. So, curious. And also, by the way, part of that is if there's a category that you're paying attention to that gives you a leading indicator of anything that's turning. Thanks.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Simeon, just as it relates to the macro first, we ultimately need to see customers, consumers re-engage for us to have confidence that home improvement is inflecting. We're watching for an uptick specifically on discretionary bigger ticket projects. I mentioned earlier what we're seeing. We're not seeing that at the moment. I think we're watching consumers continue to digest and adjust to the monetary tightening, which is working its way through the system. And that continues to have an outsized impact on housing where we see affordability challenges and historically low turnover. So again, we're not seeing that inflection point.\nThe consumers continue to kind of remain on the sidelines as Marvin mentioned, and we're waiting on that catalyst. We don't necessarily expect or understand the timing of that. But just as it relates to the comp cadence, when we look at the second half, this is about the improvement second half, not an improving macro, as I said in my prepared remarks. It's just easier year-over-year comparisons. We looked at this a number of different ways, top down, bottom up, across multiple timeframes. We've looked at DIY Pro categories and geographies, and we feel comfortable with sort of the down four over the first half and moving back to a more historical mix of transactions and ticket as we start getting into the back half of the year.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey, Simeon, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is more of a broader theme that we're focused on, and that is managing through any unique challenges we're facing today. I think Q1 reflects that we're executing at a high level in spite of some of the macro headwind that we're dealing with. But we're really positioning ourselves to really come out of this downturn as a much better company. We've invested billions of dollars in supply chain, IT infrastructure, our digital platform, our omni systems, a store environment, merchandising assortments. In other words, whenever the macro decides to turn, we're going to come out of it as a much stronger, more productive company.\nSo although we can't predict when that's going to happen, Brandon outlined our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to continue to make sure we prepare ourselves. Whenever the positive trends start to show up, we're going to be ready for it, and we're going to take full advantage of it.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nHardline, Broadline and Food Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for that. Related to that, Marvin or Brandon, incremental margins when the business turns, is there a case to be made that you spend into an upturn faster than what you're spending now? Are there places that you've held back on such that incremental margins aren't a typical cycle coming out of into a housing recovery?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nNo, Simeon, I would say we've been fully committed to our long-term roadmap in terms of capital, major projects, PPI, and top-line growth initiatives. Still been fully committed to that. We haven't pulled back at all. As Marvin mentioned, we're investing in the business for the long term, committed to the long-term trajectory, and looking forward to comp starting to turn whenever that may be. We believe kind of a long-term algorithm holds in place once that happens.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nHardline, Broadline and Food Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the state of the home improvement cycle, how are you currently looking at the trade-off between driving sales and market share versus sacrificing gross margin? Understanding that you expect your gross margin to improve over the course of the year, are you more willing to make this trade-off now with the view that it'll be a benefit as the cycle recovers?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nMichael, I'll take the first part of that. This is Marvin, and I'll let Brandon give some additional perspective. I think Bill said it best. We're trying to meet the customer where the customer currently is at. If the customer is looking for value, value does not always equate to low price. It equates to a great return for the dollar you spend. We feel really fortunate that we can make early investments in the customer with events and activities to win that early spring customer and still have an opportunity to outperform earnings per share and operating margin. Then, as Brandon mentioned, we have initiatives in place that give us confidence that we'll roughly recover any gross margin decrement in the back half and end the year relatively flat.\nWe're going to be able to pull all the levers we have to make sure that we can aggressively serve the customer well. We believe in a very simple philosophy, and that is during the spring season, if you win the customer early, you get multiple shopping occasions throughout the spring and the year. Bill and his team, along with great execution in the stores and the supply chain, allowed us to do that. That's the overreaching philosophy. I'll let Brandon give you more specifics on how we think about it for the balance of the year.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Michael, I would just add, as Marvin said, we were really pleased with our ability to pivot our go-to-market strategy, especially as we saw customer behavior start to change over the back half of last year. Our execution, our marketing approach, how we highlighted value, we believe helped us win Q1. We did see a little bit of margin pressure from those actions, but really pleased that we were able to manage that and offset that within SG&A and still deliver the bottom-line number. I think confident that we can manage the portfolio as we move through the balance of the year.\nYou mentioned we do expect some of these gross margin pressures to start to tail off as we move through the year and PPI to start to accelerate. So we're committed to delivering both the top-line and the bottom-line in line with our guide.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. My follow-up question is on the DIY loyalty program. What has been the lift that you've experienced from rolling that out so far, and what do you expect to see over the course of the year? Seems like given the performance in the first half, while there are easier comparisons in the back half, you're probably embedding some contribution from this factor in order to get to the full-year guidance.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, Mike, this is Marvin. We're not going to get into the specifics of the lift, but as I remind you and everyone, we launched a program in March. The initial focus was on enrollment, getting active members engaged, app downloads, and we're really pleased with how well it's going. The rollout was very smooth, and it really spotlights the benefits of really modernizing our store operating system. We could not have rolled this loyalty program out a year ago because we were still in the process of retiring a 30-year-old operating system, which is now, for all intents and purposes, behind us.\nAnd the store associates' engagement was simply tremendous in educating the customer and making sure that they were articulating the value. So our objective is just to simply take the data to serve our customers more effectively. Data is a new currency, but it's only beneficial if you use it to benefit the customer experience. We think we'll be able to do that. We're also believing that we'll be able to get additional trips from the customer throughout the year. It's early, but we're pleased with the results, and we'll look forward to updating you and the external community throughout the year on the progress we're making.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck with the rest of the spring.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equities, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. I wanted to follow up on the comp cadence. Sounds like still some of the macro pressures. If you look at the comp you just reported, the -4%, and you're doing -2% to -3% for the year, how much of that improvement is coming from ticket cycling, what was happening a year ago versus traffic improvement?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Greg, this is Brandon. Majority of that's going to be traffic-related. I think as I look at the breakdown across the year on ticket and transactions, we're, for the most part, expecting average ticket to hold consistent over the course of the remainder of the year, just as we saw here in Q1. Some slight pressure, ticket-related, as we've shifted down into smaller ticket seasonal projects, which has boosted transactions. And then we're also seeing continued ticket pressure, as I mentioned, from the DIY big ticket discretionary, and that includes some of the appliance promo pressure. But the flip side is Pro growth continues to run strong force, which is helping mix ticket up.\nThen as we look at really the second half of the year and the cadence improve, again, it's a function of really what we're cycling, and we expect the transactions to start to pick up as we accelerate into the second half of the year. We're going to see, again, a much more historical relationship between ticket and transaction over the course of the second half of the year.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equities, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Then a follow-up on the gross margin. It's still flat for the year, but you'd expect it to be down in Q2 similar to Q1 and then up 50 basis points in the back half. Is that the right way to model that?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nI won't put a specific number on Q2, but we do expect Q2 to be similarly pressured with supply chain investments and some of the credit pressure that we're continuing to see. But for sure, as we get into the second half, we're seeing the improvement, the acceleration of PPI flow-through with some of the supplier clawback cost out. There's some timing benefits that'll come through in the second half of the year. And then some of the credit pressures just start to ease. Again, that's a cycling timing issue as we started to see some of the interest rate pressures and delinquencies started to pressure in the second half of last year. So we expect that to smooth out as well. So that's sort of the shape of the curve there.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equities, Evercore ISI\n\nI may have missed it, but was the new reward program part of the gross margin pressure in Q1 or no?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nNot significant at this point, just given the timing of when we scaled that.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equities, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's awesome. Thanks, guys, and good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Greg.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, everyone. I want to talk about how the quarter played out. So the quarter started off weaker, as you reported originally, and then you did see an improvement, came in ahead of forecast. How do you think about how much of that was driven by seasonal versus maybe some other areas that could have come in a little bit better? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nI'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it over to Bill. I mean, this was broadly a weather dynamic from a standpoint of how the sales flowed. We feel really good about the execution. We feel great about some of the initiatives with SpringFest and how the customers responded. But the cadence for us was really driven by the impact of weather to the initiatives. I'll let Bill kind of walk through some of the specific initiatives and how it played out in Q1.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, Marvin. And Seth, I think the big difference for us this year is that we took a slightly different approach to our marketing. As I said in my prepared remarks, we took a geo-targeted approach, which was really going south to north with our SpringFest campaign. And we put some offers out there that were seasonally relevant. We were able to target those south to north. And then we got a little bit of weather favorability that happened in March, and then we carried that into April. We were able to navigate some storm weather. We took advantage of that. But the teams did a really nice job of making sure that we had new products, new brands.\nWe saw Toro really respond well for us. We continue to see EGO perform well. We continue to see anything that we've done, as I said earlier in a question that was asked earlier, around innovative products perform well. We've seen the consumer respond now with the weather advantages. The grass is growing, so they're out there buying zero-turn riding mowers. They're buying full-size gas grills. So we're seeing that work. And now we've got, as we go into Q2, we've got Memorial Day, July 4th, Father's Day in front of us. So we've got to take advantage of those events as we finish out the quarter. So those are really the results.\nAnd where we've had weather, we've seen it play to our advantage. And the lawn and garden team, as I said, had really nice results in the Q1, driving that with traffic-driving events, with soils, mulch, live goods. They took advantage of that customer that was out there getting their yard ready early in spring. So that was really the drivers.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nBrandon, just one more thing. Just as you recall, at the beginning of the year, we did plan Q1 for a much more normal spring season. And we had called out the last two years about a $400 million drag related to unfavorable weather the last two years. So cycling against that, some of that recovery moved into Q2 over the last couple of years. So that's also embedded into our outlook as we're looking at Q2 for this year.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Got it. That makes sense. Just a related question on the improvement that you saw in the Pro business going back to positive this quarter. Obviously, there's a lot that you're doing to drive that, but any sense whether that reflects market share gains or just broader improvement in some of those Pro-oriented categories? And I guess any perspective on if your performance is coming from customer growth or wallet share and just any context there? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, I think overall, we're very pleased with the performance of our Pro strategy. As you know, it's been a five-year investment journey on things like investing in job lot quantities for inventory, improving service levels, adding national brands. Bill and I both mentioned the great performance of Klein Tools, the number one brand for electricians and HVAC professionals. Bringing brands like that to the assortment, it just adds to the credibility of the turnaround that we've been on in trying to win some of these customers back from years past, in addition to a stronger digital platform, a great loyalty program that's resonating with the customers.\nAnd from the survey results that we shared, I mean, this is a resilient customer that continues to fight through the economic headwinds, and their backlog is relatively equal to last year. So overall, that's driving it. Whether or not we're taking share or not is, look, we don't want to determine that as much as we're just looking internally at just much improved execution and results. I'll let Joe talk a little bit about some of the other initiatives that we're driving that we think is really resonating that allowed us to get this business back to positive.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Thanks, Marvin. Seth, as you think about some of the investments that we've made, Marvin's called them out, Bill's called them out, job lot quantities, safety stock, but also our enhancement in our job site delivery for larger orders. If you think about the maturity of our loyalty program in Pro, our CRM program, we're growing share of wallet. We continue to expand our Lowe's Pro supply. And then from the survey that Marvin had mentioned, the dimensions of the health we look at, backlogs, materials, credit, labor, and the project type, the pros have been stable and steady there. And so we're pleased with the gains we're making with this customer, both in-store, product-wise, and online.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nAnd Seth, I'll just close the Pro discussion with just one additional point. We're really focused on the customer that we can serve at a very high level. And that's that small to medium pro. And we estimate that's a $200 billion market opportunity. And so we're focused squarely on that customer. That customer still leverages the store for fill-in. We can leverage the productivity of our existing real estate footprint to serve that customer well. We can do it without having to make dramatic investments in operating expense in addition to the fulfillment capabilities that Joe talked about.\nSo we are very confident that our strategy is working, and that is reflected in the results. We still have other investments to make. We'll make them. And we hopefully will continue to see this business head in the right direction in spite of a very difficult macro.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHey, good morning, guys. I guess just on the DIY loyalty program, I know it didn't have much of an impact on the P&L here in Q1, but just curious how we should think about that longer term as it scales. Maybe a comment also on the associated lift in the private label credit signups, what you're seeing there, what that means, I guess, going forward, and any perspective on how private label credit has been for you guys historically and what's maybe possible here with this new program.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. This is Brandon. Just again, Marvin hit on this a bit, but our goals overall with the loyalty program are to create further stickiness with our DIY, drive repeat visits, and spend over time, our ability to get the data and drive more personalized marketing. Super pleased with what we're seeing with engagement from the customer standpoint and our associates. We're managing the enrollments, the membership points, redemptions. You mentioned sort of financially, we're targeting effectively one more trip annually from our DIY customers.\nThat's the revenue upside as we see it, and it's going to take some time to gauge success of that. So we're going to have to watch that play out over the course of the year. And then in terms of the overlay with the credit program, I mean, we are bundling and building on top of a 5% credit offer that we believe is best in class. It's going to continue to drive increased penetration there. And we think that that value really resonates with the customer, and we're able to make that work financially. So we think it's a win-win there.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Peter. Do an add-on to Brandon quickly. We're pleased with the first kind of loyalty perk that we rolled with Mother's Day, the engagement we had with the members and new members, as well as our associates and our ability to gain incremental loyalty members. And so as an early example there, the Mother's Day engagement, we're very pleased with.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nWow, that's great. Thanks. I guess my follow-up would be just around the plans for the go-to-market strategy over the balance of the year. I mean, it clearly sounds like you guys took some steps here during the spring to capture some incremental business. As you think about the back half of the year, have you layered in additional, I guess, events or promotions to kind of help get that comp trend improved? If not, is that a lever you think you'll need to pull or be willing to pull? Just kind of curious how you're thinking about the balance of the year, the second half of the year with respect to promotions. Thank you.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Peter, it's Bill. The promotional environment remains stable. Nothing radically crazy. We're going to go similar to what we've been doing. We want to be seasonally relevant as we go into the back half of the year. Obviously, we'll be out there as we go into fall with Labor Day. We're going to introduce Halloween. We're going to make sure that we're relevant with holiday and gift center, and introduce and set our stores for spring in the Deep South for that December, January timeframe. We're going to make that transition. We're going to be relevant as the consumer comes out of those key seasonal categories. We'll make that transition into those fall seasonal categories. There won't be anything goofy that'll happen in the second half of the year. That's how we're going to approach it.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good luck, guys.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nRob, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Our final question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I wanted to dig into regional trends. Some peers have been calling out less worse trends in the west. It was one of the first regions to enter the housing recession. So are you seeing less worse trends there? It looks like 60 or 15 geographic regions outperform the company average. So any more detail in terms of regional variability that you're seeing would be helpful. That's my first question.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Jonathan, it's Joe, thank you for the question. From a geographic standpoint, as we said, where we've seen great weather, we've seen great performance. But from an overall and geographical standpoint, our west is our best performance for Q1.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. And Jonathan, I would just add consistent Pro outperformance across all of our regions. So really pleased with that. And then conversely, pretty much uniform ongoing pressure in DIY big ticket discretionary. So that's been pretty broad-based on both the Pro side and the pressure, and no real differences in what we're seeing across regions.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. I think the only comment I make, Jonathan, is that our rural stores continue to be our best-performing subset of stores within the overall geography. Some of the initiatives that Bill's team initiated with pet and apparel continue to perform really well in those locations. We continue to evaluate the expansion of those categories in non-rural environments. But overall, the West outperformed. As Brandon mentioned, Pro was widespread at a really strong performance. The rural set of our stores kind of is the high watermark in performance among all geographic locations.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThat's really helpful. Thanks for that. Then just quickly, just to circle back on big ticket, I know there were some questions earlier. Just to be clear, what does the midpoint of your annual comp guidance embed for big ticket? Right? So over 500 transactions, we're down around 7.5%. So does that 2% to 3% comp decline for the year require sequential improvement in year-over-year declines for purchases over 500? Or are you expecting that to basically continue throughout the rest of 2024? Thanks.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Again, Jonathan, I think just on an absolute dollar performance standpoint, we're expecting more of the same in terms of what we saw second half. We don't have any macro improvement sort of embedded in. So from an absolute standpoint across these categories, we're expecting similar performance as we move through the year. But the comps should improve significantly in these categories just again based on what we're cycling and when we started to see the downturn in the second half of last year.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all. Thanks. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our Q2 Earnings Call in August.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the Lowe's Q1 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect."

I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's investor relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2024.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A, and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the Q4, comparable sales declined 6.2% as DIY customers continued to remain cautious with their home improvement spend, and harsh weather impacted large parts of the US in January. In spite of these challenges, I'm very pleased with the excellent customer service on our stores and strong operating profit performance for the quarter, driven by disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives, or PPI. Looking at the full fiscal year 2023, we delivered sales of $86.4 billion, adjusted operating margin of 13.3%, and adjusted earnings per share of $13.09. Beginning with our DIY sales results, November and December trends improved from the Q3, followed by a sharp drop in traffic during periods of extreme weather in January.\nMacroeconomic factors like persistent inflation and a stagnant housing market continue to make DIY customers and consumers hesitant to spend on big-ticket purchases for their homes, and those who did engage in home improvement activities took on smaller, non-discretionary projects with a heightened focus on value. This impacted demand for bigger-ticket interior categories like kitchen and bath, flooring, and appliances. In the last quarter, we shifted our strategy to adapt to these changing consumer behaviors, resulting in record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales and improved holiday sell-through and margins. While we're pleased to see these results, we're now focused on winning spring, and we're excited to see how the customer responds to our more targeted, traffic-driving marketing strategy and our lineup of great spring products at an outstanding value. Bill will provide more detail on our compelling product assortment for spring later in the call.\nAmong the most exciting changes for this spring is our new DIY loyalty program that we announced in January. This first-of-its-kind rewards program, designed for DIY customers, gives these value-focused homeowners more reasons to choose Lowe's. In a marketplace where nearly all DIY home improvement customers shop multiple retailers, MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program is designed to get these DIY customers to choose Lowe's over other retail competitors for home improvement needs. We expect this to drive traffic and return visits, while also enabling us to personalize offers and experiences for our loyalty members, creating a flywheel effect that increases DIY loyalty and demand over time, both in store and online. MyLowe's Rewards will be available nationwide in March, just in time for spring, making Lowe's the only national home improvement retailer with a distinct loyalty offering for both pro and DIY customers.\nNow, moving to Pro, despite a challenging macro environment and difficult weather in January, our comparable Pro sales were flat for the quarter. As a reminder, our core Pro customer is a small to medium-sized business owner, and in our recent Pro survey, these customers told us their backlogs are in line with last year, and they are cautiously optimistic about their ability to generate and close leads in 2024. We remain focused on executing our holistic Pro strategy with more convenient fulfillment options and enhanced product assortment, creating a best-in-class digital experience and a rewards program that incentivizes long-term loyalty. As these investments scale and mature, they will increasingly save pros time and money, enabling us to earn more of their business as we aim to grow Pro at 2x the market rate.\nNow, turning to online, comparable sales were flat for the quarter, and we're pleased to see higher conversion rates and lower returns, a positive indicator that customers are responding to our faster fulfillment and improved digital experience. Our talented technology team remains focused on developing a best-in-class, omnichannel experience to seamlessly serve our multi-generational customer base, including co-creating innovative customer solutions with world-class technology companies like our immersive kitchen design app for Apple's new Vision Pro headset and using generative AI to improve how we sell, shop, and work, like our home improvement ChatGPT plugin. Now, let's transition to our view of the macro. As we look forward, many of you are asking when we expect home improvement demand to inflect, although it's a very fair question. Unfortunately, it's still very difficult to predict.\nAnd while there's increased confidence of a soft landing, there's still a lot of speculation on the timing of anticipated interest rate cuts and the pace of slowing inflation. It's also unclear how quickly the consumer will react to these changes and how quickly their spending habits will change. Overall, the consumer is financially healthy, but in this post-pandemic timeframe, customers are still showing a preference for spending on services with elevated demand for travel, restaurants, and other experiences. And while we anticipate these trends will normalize, the timing is uncertain. Also, existing home sales are at levels we've not seen in almost 30 years, and even as mortgage rates decline, 2/3 of homeowners remain locked in at rates below 4%, which may keep many on the sidelines.\nDue to these factors, we expect DIY demand to remain under pressure, and Brandon will provide more detail on our 2024 expectations later in the call. However, we're very confident in our strategic plan and in our ability to execute at a high level in a multitude of economic environments. Despite near-term uncertainty, let me remind you why we remain bullish on the medium and long-term outlook for home improvement. The three core demand drivers of our business (disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of housing stock) remain supportive. When you pair these factors with trends like chronic undersupplied homes, millennial household formation, baby boomers aging in place, and a sustained number of people working from home, you can see why we are confident that home improvement demand will trend upward over time across both homeowners and pros.\nIn the meantime, we're focused on controlling what we control and making the right investments in our Total Home Strategy to modernize our supply chain and IT infrastructure, localize and improve our merchandising assortments, rolling out a Pro and DIY loyalty program, continuing to elevate our store environment, and developing a best-in-class digital and omnichannel experience. All of these investments in our Total Home Strategy will position Lowe's to win in the short run and set us up for strong sales and profit growth when the home improvement market recovers. Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our hardworking associates for their commitment to serving customers. In recognition of their dedication, we awarded our frontline associates with an end-of-year discretionary bonus of $140 million.\nThis is our way of saying thank you to all the associates and assistant managers who serve our customers and make our communities better. As I travel across the country visiting stores and conducting town halls to hear directly from our frontline associates, I'm consistently humbled by their passion, commitment, and their expertise. Now, I turn the call over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. While softer DIY demand trends continue this quarter, we remain focused on highlighting value and convenience, both in our stores and online, to a price-conscious consumer, all while maintaining a balanced focus on profitability. We are also staying committed to serving a resilient pro, which resulted in flat pro comps as we continued to enhance our pro product and service offering. Beginning with building products, this was our best-performing area with positive comps in building materials. This strength was fueled by an increased demand for roofing and drywall, combined with improved fulfillment capabilities and in-stock positions to better serve our pro customers. Throughout the quarter, we continued to launch additional Klein products across our stores, bringing the number one tool brand for electrical and HVAC professionals back to Lowe's.\nWe now have the largest assortment of Klein Tools in a home improvement retail channel, with initial sales exceeding our expectations across electrical, hand tools, and stackable tool storage. Throughout the store, we continue to introduce new and innovative products to Lowe's, like Pella's Hidden Screen windows. This new window includes a built-in screen that appears when the window is open but hides away when it's closed. Turning to home decor, this division was significantly impacted by softer DIY demand in big-ticket interior categories like kitchens and bath, flooring, and appliances. This past quarter, we pivoted our go-to-market strategy to be more responsive to a shift in shopping trends, like the appliance consumers' increasing preference for a single-unit purchase and their search for the best deal.\nWhile these actions pressured our average selling price as expected, this approach was a major contributor to our successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. While some consumers remain budget-conscious, we are seeing others trade up for innovation, which we continue to offer across all major appliance categories. A great example is our exclusive LG Smart Refrigerator, which has a double freezer and also makes the popular slow-melting Craft Ice. This product is consistently a top seller despite retailing for over $2,500. This type of innovation adds to our already industry-leading assortment in appliances, including high-quality brands like Bosch, Miele, LG, Samsung, and KitchenAid, and we are continuing to help our customers see the value and attainability of trading up for affordable premium features. Paint is another category where we've seen product innovation resonate, like our exclusive line of SpecRight paint designed for pros who paint.\nBeyond gaining traction with pros, we saw strong exterior paint demand before the weather turned colder in January, which gives us confidence we have the right offering in place as spring arrives. We also recently completed the rollout of our upgraded paint department, which converted our color wall to trusted Sherwin-Williams colors and improved the shopping experience to make it easier for our customers to grab the higher-margin attachment items they need to complete their paint projects. Turning to our results in hardlines, this is another area where we quickly adjusted to the changing consumer buying patterns, which was reflected in our improved holiday sell-through and profitability. We are also encouraged that our new rural assortments continue to resonate across the country, with strength in apparel, pet, and automotive, as consumers respond to the products and brands.\nWe also recently launched a new partnership with Sunrun, the market leader in home solar and battery installation. This partnership now enhances our services offering for consumers looking to power their homes with renewable energy. Lowe's is the go-to destination for homeowners in spring, and as we enter our biggest season of the year, we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this demand. As Marvin mentioned, we are excited about our product lineup. The launch of Toro builds on our industry-leading outdoor power equipment lineup alongside John Deere, Ariens, EGO, Craftsman, Husqvarna, Kobalt, and Skil. Our outdoor power equipment assortment is unmatched in home improvement, which is reflected in our continued market leadership in this space.\nI'm also excited about our new patio sets from our private brands, Allen + Roth and Origin 21, which enables homeowners to update their outdoor spaces for spring with trending styles across multiple price points. If consumers don't see the color they're looking for on our sales floor, they can easily shop the extended aisle, with associates now able to tender the purchase directly on their mobile smart devices. The merchants in our seasonal businesses are also bringing customers innovation and functionality at more competitive prices, like our new exclusive Char-Broil Grill lineup, which lets grillers switch from a traditional grill to a griddle in seconds, or the fast-growing Blackstone brand of grills that continues to bring new features and value to the market. Beyond our compelling seasonal assortment and strong in-stock position, I'm also looking forward to launching our enhanced marketing strategy for spring.\nThis season, we are taking a more sophisticated, tech-enabled advertising approach, and we'll be featuring traffic-driving events that will motivate homeowners to get started on their spring projects at Lowe's. We are also leaning into live sports with an expanded NFL relationship and leveraging our popular commercials featuring Lowe's home team players trying their hands at DIY projects. We are extremely pleased with the success of this season's home team players, with two members of the Lowe's team, Travis Kelce and Christian McCaffrey, both participating in Super Bowl LVIII while being featured in our commercials. Shifting gears to merchandising productivity, our team is making tremendous progress on our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI initiatives, which, as we planned, are offsetting the cost of our supply chain and pro investments.\nAs a reminder, the PPI initiatives that I outlined at our analyst and investor conference include expanding our private brand penetration, improving inventory productivity, maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing and promotions, scaling our retail media network, and closely managing product costs. Over the past year, we have been working closely with our vendor partners to claw back some of the cost increases we absorbed during periods of exceptionally high inflation, and now that raw material and transportation costs are normalizing. Our best-in-class cost optimization tool gives us robust data down to the item level that allows us to take a calculated, surgical approach, helping guide us to reducing costs across our portfolio. As we work to recoup these costs with our suppliers, we are reinvesting those savings into our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive traffic and sales.\nAs I close, I'd like to thank our vendors and merchants for their unwavering focus on delivering value to our shared customers and for putting us in a strong position to win spring. I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our frontline team for their relentless focus on execution this quarter. Their efforts to serve our customers while tightly managing control of expenses once again resulted in improved customer service scores and strong operating profit performance despite slower sales. Customer satisfaction scores were up 200 basis points this quarter versus last year, with improvements in both Pro and DIY, reflecting the hard work of our frontline associates combined with improved omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. In fact, this year, omni scores improved almost 25% since 2020. Customers have new functionality like two-way texting, where they can be notified in advance to confirm their delivery date, as well as same-day delivery options through our gig network.\nThey can also use our new self-service functionality to track their order status and resolve issues directly, all without needing to call a store. In addition to expanding our fulfillment options and improving how we communicate with our customers, we're also enhancing the focus for bottom-line pickup and store experience through our new front-end configuration. We completed over 450 front-end rollouts this year, with over 500 planned for 2024. Customers are embracing the new front-end experience, telling us they appreciate the faster and easier checkout process. This new front-end configuration also keeps sales associates in the aisles helping customers instead of needing to assist with the checkout process when lines get long. While we are improving the front end of our stores, we are also making strides on the back end with our ongoing freight flow transformation.\nWe are further improving our freight flow process with distribution centers now adding new labels that are linked to each store's layout. These labels provide our store teams with direction of exactly where to place the product on the sales floor once the freight is removed from receiving. These enhancements will make it quicker and easier for associates to get products onto the floor and cross-merchandise attachments, and will drive better in-stocks for our customers and improve payroll productivity for our stores. These new capabilities and improved processes are all part of our ongoing perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI initiatives, which both improve the customer experience and drive profitability. Turning to our efforts to become the employer of choice in retail, I am really pleased with the progress we've made. Last quarter, we saw a record response rate to our annual associate engagement survey with 90%+ participation.\nEven more importantly, scores improved significantly across three areas that we measure: engagement, leadership effectiveness, and inclusion. It's clear that better associate engagement leads to lower turnover and directly translates into better business results, with a workforce more focused on serving our customers and driving productivity in our operations. As Marvin mentioned, we announced $140 million in discretionary bonuses this quarter. This includes an incremental $5,000 for our assistant store managers and other frontline supervisors, as well as our special discretionary bonus of $400 for full-time hourly associates, and $200 for part-time hourly associates. Additionally, since 2018, we have invested over $3.5 billion in incremental wage and share-based compensation for our frontline associates. In fact, we are one of the few retailers to award stock grants to our store managers and assistant store managers so they share in our long-term success.\nThese programs for our store leaders are not new. In fact, store managers have been receiving share-based compensation for decades and assistant store managers since 2019. We are also creating opportunities for advancement for our associates to encourage them to build their careers with Lowe's. Since 2018, we have added over 10,000 new department supervisors and over 2,500 new assistant store managers. Through Lowe's University, we are training and developing our associates for their next role. This year, we're extending our advanced leadership training to our assistant store managers to equip them with the tools they need to succeed as they move up in their career. With these enhancements, we've worked to increase the number of store managers promoted from ASM to over 80% over the past three years. In fact, more than 80% of our leadership roles are now filled from within.\nAll of these investments have led to one of the best spring staffing levels in many years, and the stores are ready to serve our customers this spring. We are very excited about the new MyLowe's Rewards DIY Loyalty Program and the great spring merchandise lineup Bill outlined. As I close, I would like to once again thank all of our store associates for their hard work and dedication. Now I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We generated diluted earnings per share of $1.77. As a reminder, in the prior year, we recognized $441 million of pre-tax transaction costs associated with the sale of the Canadian retail business. My comments from this point forward will include comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year where applicable. Q4 sales were $18.6 billion. Of note, prior year sales included $958 million generated in our Canadian retail business and approximately $1.4 billion related to the additional 53rd week. Also, Q4 results reflect approximately $200 million in sales headwind due to the related shift in our fiscal calendar. Comp sales were down 6.2%, driven by continued pressure in DIY, bigger ticket spending, and unfavorable January winter weather. Lumber deflation did not have a material impact on comp sales.\nAlthough the calendar shift pressured total sales growth in Q4, it had no impact on comparable sales, as comps are calculated based on weeks 41 to 53 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was down 0.1% to prior year. Continued ticket growth in many pro-heavy categories offset appliance pricing pressure and lower DIY bigger-ticket sales. Comp transactions declined 6.1%, driven by the DIY slowdown and unfavorable January winter weather impacting traffic. Our monthly comps were down 4.8% in November and 6.6% in December. January comps declined 7.4% as we experienced significant pressure during weeks of unfavorable winter weather. Gross margin was 32.4% of sales in the Q4, up 7 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from multiple PPI initiatives as well as favorable product mix and lower transportation costs. These benefits were somewhat offset by supply chain expansion cost.\nSG&A of 20.9% of sales deleveraged 5 basis points versus prior year adjusted SG&A, as the momentum we continue to build with our PPI initiatives across all functional areas of the company largely offset sales volume deleverage. Operating margin rate of 9.1% declined 48 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 23.8% in line with prior year adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $16.9 billion, $1.6 billion lower than the prior year quarter as we invest in high-velocity pro SKUs while managing replenishment in line with sales trends and improving the flow of spring product builds through our supply chain. As a reminder, prior year inventory excluded Canadian operations as the sale was complete before year-end. Now turning to capital allocation.\nIn 2023, we generated $6.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $8.9 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the Q4, we paid $632 million in dividends at $1.10 per share and repurchased 1.9 million shares for $404 million, returning over $1 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $620 million in Q4 as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth and profitability. Adjusted Debt to EBITDA finished the year at 2.81x. Lastly, we delivered a Return on Invested Capital above 36% for the year. Now I would like to discuss our 2024 outlook. As Marvin mentioned, we are bullish on the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry, but the near-term macro backdrop remains uncertain.\nThere is optimism around potential interest rate cuts and improved consumer sentiment, however, the timing of Fed actions remains unclear, and there can be a lag before monetary policy impacts the consumer. Also, housing turnover remains depressed, and the consumer is still showing a greater preference for spending on services rather than goods. We are expecting these factors to continue to pressure home improvement spending in 2024, especially for the DIY. And with that in mind, we are expecting sales ranging from $84 to $85 billion and comparable sales declines in a range of 2% to 3%. Pro sales should continue to outpace DIY as we leverage our multi-year strategy to improve product offerings, fulfillment options, and the in-store and digital shopping experience to drive pro growth at 2x the market rate. We expect operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.7%.\nWhen we bridge our 2023 operating margin to our 2024 expectations, there are a couple of points to keep in mind. First, the impact of sales volume deleverage, and second, the cycling of a favorable legal settlement in each of the first two quarters. These pressures are partly offset by the expected positive impact of our ongoing enterprise-wide PPI initiatives. We have made significant progress in realizing our productivity goals over the past few years, and we remain laser-focused on driving these PPI efforts and closely managing expenses through this tough sales environment. These expectations result in full-year earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30. Now, to assist you with your modeling, I'd like to take a moment and provide some color on the cadence of our expected results for the year.\nAs a reminder, the steep pullback in DIY demand, which intensified in the Q3 of 2023, set us up for different compares in the first and second half of this year. Given this, we expect first-half comp sales to remain under pressure as the current DIY demand trends continue. But as we move into the second half, we expect comp sales to improve as we begin to cycle over the pullback in the Q3. To be clear, we are not forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year. Rather, the compares are easier in the second half. And while we are planning for a normal spring season, the timing of spring is unpredictable and always brings some variability to our first-half performance. Given our customer mix, these DIY drivers disproportionately impact our business.\nNow, more specific to our Q1, we expect comp sales to be consistent with our Q4 results, approximately 300 basis points below the bottom of our full-year guide. The combination of lower sales volumes, as well as cycling a sizable legal settlement, is expected to result in a Q1 operating margin rate approximately 200 basis points below the prior year adjusted rate. Before I close, let me remind you of our capital allocation strategy, which remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business with capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. Next, we continue to target a 35% dividend payout ratio. We also plan to use our free cash flow to repay a $450 million bond maturity and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases.\nIn closing, we are confident in our ability to execute through the near-term market uncertainty and remain focused on realizing the benefits of our total home strategy while continuing to drive sustainable shareholder value. With that, we'll open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We are now ready for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. To start your question, press Star 2. In order to allow questions for as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question today comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please just use your questions.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one would be just around the sensitivity of your margin forecast if comps end up trending below that 2% to 3% range for the year. Then alternatively, as you think perhaps longer term, as comps swing positive, just what types of incrementals do you think you could achieve on that, given that you've been pretty lean on the expense front here given the current environment? That's my first question.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, hey, Peter, sure. This is Brandon. In terms of incremental, decremental, we've established essentially a flow-through rule of thumb. If our sales do exceed the top end of our guide, we do expect about 10 basis points for every 1% of incremental comp sales on the high side. Then on the low side, sales fall below the bottom end. We're looking at about 15 basis points of margin contraction for every point of comp decline. So high level, that's more of a rule of thumb on an annual basis. It doesn't necessarily work in terms of quarterly performance. The other thing I'll stress is the +10 and -15, not necessarily natural outputs. I would tell you that the model and the algorithm are very contingent on us continuing to drive PPI across all functions, and that's what's contemplated on both the upside and the downside.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then technically, just around, I mean, you've had success with your cost optimization efforts. Just kind of your view on where you stand with those, how much more is left to go, and how that kind of plays into maybe your view of average ticket versus traffic in 2024. Do you think you can hold on to the ticket in 2024, given all the dynamics out there and you're clawing back some cost? Do you think you'll reinvest and maybe tickets down? Just curious how you see that interplaying in 2024. Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Peter, I think your first question on just our ability to manage costs, we're really pleased with our ability to manage expenses here the last couple of years through this downturn. We have a robust and evolving roadmap of PPI initiatives. We were down comps 4.7% this year, expecting down at the midpoint 2.5%. So our ability to manage the sales deleverage there with that robust pipeline, again, really pleased there. And as we look out, a number of initiatives you heard from Joe and Bill that we continue to be excited about. We believe in 2024, in particular, that PPI is going to enable us to offset over $400 million of wage pressure, inflationary pressure, and strategic investments. I think the second part of your question, just as we think about ticket into 2024, we are expecting that to hold up.\nAnd that's largely what we saw in 2023. The pullback is expected, again, in transactions. And really, the drivers of that pro growth positively impacting average ticket more from a mixed standpoint. And then on the pressure points side, we're continuing to see the DIY bigger ticket pressure, and that's going to continue to be a drag. We don't expect any significant improvement off of that second half 2023 run rate. And then on appliances, specifically, ASPE pressure expected to continue as we return to a more of a pre-pandemic environment. But overall, as we cycle into the second half of the year, we are expecting a more normal historical relationship between average ticket and transactions.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGotcha. Thanks. Appreciate it. Good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYep. Thank you, Peter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please just use your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. I know there's a lot of moving pieces on the SG&A line as you lap the legal settlement and some of the incentive comp dynamics. So is there any way you could bridge all the puts and takes in a little bit more detail from the 13.3% operating margin in 2023 to your 12.6%, 12.7% in 2024, and also any color on gross margin versus SG&A?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Zach, this is Brandon. I would say on SG&A, it's really two themes, and it's the cycling of the settlements, and it's deleverage on lower sales. And when you look at the midpoint of the range, it's a step back about 65 basis points; it breaks down about half and half there. So those are really, as we look at managing SG&A in 2024, those are the pressure points. You mentioned incentive compensation. We paid a discretionary bonus in Q4 of $140 million, which offset any previously expected Q4 benefit that we had from lower management incentive comp, and we're pleased that we were able to reward our frontline associates. But what that resulted in for the full year 2023, we had a benefit from lower management incentive comp based on performance that was offset by the discretionary frontline bonuses that we paid in Q2 and Q4.\nSo that really does not create a headwind for us as we bridge 2023 to 2024. So back to the two themes, it's mainly the cycling of the legal settlements and the deleverage on lower sales.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGotcha. And then two more quick ones, just any color on gross margin. And then second, your pro comps were slightly positive in 2023 by my math and outcomping DIY for a few years now. So curious if you could just talk about DIY versus pro mix today and if it's still in that 75-25 range.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Zach, sorry, I forgot your gross margin question. So I'll take that one. I'll toss it to Marvin for Pro. So we're expecting gross margins for 2024 to be roughly flat. And the gross margin themes are really similar to what we saw here in 2023. Ongoing supply chain investment pressure as we wrap the rollout of market delivery. We're continuing to make investments in Pro fulfillment, but those pressures are being offset by ongoing PPI initiatives that Bill discussed as we manage product costs, lower transportation, continue to expect private brands. So those are the puts and takes from a gross margin standpoint. And on Pro, I'll toss it to you, Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, so on the mix, that's directly correct on the percentages. And look, we feel good about the resilience of our pro customer. And as a reminder, our customer is a small to medium-sized business owner, and we're actually pleased with the survey results where they feel confident that they can build the backlog is consistent with what they saw last year, and that they can continue to drive their business. And again, they're cautiously optimistic based on what they know, but that gives us confidence that the things we're doing around loyalty, around product assortment expansion, around service levels, our digital platform, and how we've dramatically improved that, and we think we have a best-in-class experience is resonating. And relative to the DIY, I mean, we equally feel good about the level of execution in that business.\nI mean, we view this probably as a macro issue versus a strategic issue or any type of an execution issue. As Brandon and I both said in our prepared comments, when we think about the medium to long term, we're very bullish because we've made tremendous investments in this business across supply chain, IT infrastructure, omnichannel, localization, assortment planning, space productivity, store environment, and service levels that we know are going to pay dividends not only in the short run while we deal with this macroeconomic headwind, but when the market recovers, we think we're perfectly positioned to grow and take market share.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks for the time.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Zach.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Marvin, your answer just now touched on this a bit. I wanted to put it out here. There's this perception or even misperception that the way that Lowe's expenses have been so well managed could either impact how much sales can grow when the cycle resumes or how much EPS grows if you have to put more SG&A back into the business. So I'm curious if you can comment on that.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nNo, look, it's a fair question. I think the best way for me to answer would be our customer service results. When you look at the fact that we have improvements in both pro and DIY, 200 basis points for both, that gives you an indication that our service levels remain extremely high and also gives you an understanding of the power of our PPI initiatives because a lot of our expense takeout is not the traditional cut payroll. It is more about the investments of technology that drives productivity, that allows us to add more hours to driving service, selling, and taking hours out of tasking. Joe's talked about this for five years, where we're trying to build a model where we invest technology and we drive productivity that allows us to have more customer-facing associates and less tasking.\nSo we believe that our activity-based staffing model puts us in a great position, that when sales go up, we invest the payroll based on the activity driven to create the sales. And when sales come down, we have an activity-based system that we think is best in class, that we can take hours out based on department-level day and hour that we think will drive the business from a productivity standpoint, but without hindering service. So we feel good about the whole model, and we don't think there's any negative implications of sales going up and SG&A not being able to be managed as tightly and as efficiently as we've managed it the last couple of years. And Simeon, let me give you a quick example. If you think about five years ago, we had less than 50% of the stores that actually had self-checkout.\nAnd so over the last five years, we've mentioned we've developed our own internal self-checkout built with the home improvement customer in mind. We now have that complete across the entire chain. And now we've started our front-end transformation in adding incremental assisted self-checkouts. We have 400 stores complete. This has also allowed us to roll out a best-in-class loyalty program for the DIY customer that is tied right in with our mobile technology. And so as we look to complete the incremental 500 in 2024, and then I mentioned in prepared remarks our back-end initiatives too. So very confident in the activity-based labor model and the PPI initiatives we continue to focus on. One last point. I mean, that's just one example of many initiatives that Brandon and I both have on our timeline that we've yet to develop and yet to implement.\nSo this is an ongoing process that is alive and well in every function, including merchandising, as Bill outlined in his prepared comments.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for that. The follow-up is on the cycle. I think in some models, the weakest part of the cycle would have been the second half of 2023 and even the first half of 2024, and maybe the market was kind of looking for light a little bit sooner. I can't tell if that was your base case as well. It seems like the market's more dependent on existing home sales. And then, Marvin, you mentioned in the prepared comments that it is a big question of whether or not we get back to something normal. And I'm curious, when things start up again, do we get back to normal, or is it something that's less than normal?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, look, I'll give you my perspective, Simeon, and I'll let Brandon provide any additional comments. When you think about the cadence of our comp sales for this year, as Brandon mentioned, it's more indicative of year-over-year comparison versus our forecast that the market is going to improve at some point this year. We hope that it improves, and we are positioning ourselves that when that happens, we think that we will have outsized top and bottom line growth. But our perspective of 2024 is that we're going to feel this DIY pressure throughout the year, and we're going to perform at a high level, irrespective of kind of what type of macro environment that we're dealing with. I'll let Brandon add any additional comments.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, I would just say, Simeon, you mentioned the base case. I mean, our base case guide assumes no change in macro conditions versus what we've experienced here the last couple of quarters. It's unclear as the timing of the rate cuts, the improvements in home improvement share wallet. Marvin mentioned housing turnover, consumer sentiment. So sort of a more of the same philosophy there. And even when we start to see some green shoots there, it's going to be the trends are going to improve. There is an expected lag before the macro drivers we believe are going to translate into spending. So those have been the underpinnings, the assumptions that we've made here for 2024. And again, the improvement is just a function of what we're cycling in the second half versus our views on the macro and the timing of any improvement.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please just share your questions.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So, two related questions follow up on the demand environment. First, did you see weather? Do you think weather was a net headwind in the Q4? Obviously, December was warmer year over year, and that probably helped areas like outdoor paint. But then, January was much colder, and you have a much more southern geography, and it seemed to impact that part of the country more. So, do you think weather was actually a net headwind over the quarter? Was it more neutral when you think about the December side? And then, Brandon, you mentioned green shoots on share of wallet. Did you see anything in the holiday period that would suggest that that share of wallet pull forward is at least starting to move past you, but maybe not moving towards the more positive side?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nChris, let me. I'll hit the weather themes first. It really was just a January, winter, extreme winter weather story impacted January as we sized it about 200 basis points of impact on the month. It had an outsized impact on our Pro business over those weeks. The other weather theme, also just to mention, is we cycled two straight years of hurricane recovery with Ian and Ida. It's about 150 basis points comp impact at Q4, just cycling that. But again, that was all baked into our expectations. In terms of just what we saw through the holiday season, I'll actually toss it over to Bill, and he can give a view on what we saw in terms of consumer behavior there. Yeah, Chris, I think for the holiday, we saw, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw record holiday sales.\nWe saw the consumer respond very favorably to our trim and tree program and saw nice performance there. We also saw, as you mentioned, December was warmer, and so we saw those outdoor businesses perform both on the pro side as well as on the DIY side as the consumer continued to take on outdoor projects. As we've rolled into February and get started with 2024, as we begin to start our spring program for the South and Deep South, we're starting to see some of those early signs of spring where the weather is warmer, we're starting to get started with some of those spring-related businesses. Where we've got some warm weather, we're starting to see some of those early signs of spring. We're excited about that.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nMy follow-up is on the appliance category. It did track below. I think your overall comp, you mentioned ASP pressures as you're leaning to the assortment more to the value side. How are you looking at your performance relative to the market? I don't know if your track line or something gives you sort of unit demand performance relative to the market, but it's your largest category, and obviously, you have a leading assortment and footprint in the store. So how do you think you're performing on the share side? Thanks very much.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. So for the year, we saw share growth in appliances. For the quarter, we saw unit growth across all the major categories. We did see average selling price pressure, as we called out. For the key major events, both Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw nice performance across those holiday weeks, and we're pleased with that. We did see the consumer pivot, and we met them where they wanted to go, and that was a shift from multi-unit purchases to a single unit purchase as the consumer was looking for that. We also see the consumer moving to kind of two spectrums. We're seeing them look for value, so looking for products in that value conscious, and we're also seeing them trade up and finding innovation. I'll share two examples.\nThey'll look for entry-level laundry, for example, and then they're not afraid to invest in, for example, the GE Profile all-in-one washer-dryer combination that retails for over $2,500, of which we could sell every single one that we can get our hands on. So those are just two spectrums of what's going on in that business, and it's happening across really all categories of the appliance business. So it's really two spectrums of what's going on. We're continuing to see our online appliance business perform very well as that business continues to evolve, and we're continuing to build out our capabilities there to make sure that we're meeting the customer where they want to be met and those fulfillment capabilities and delivery.\nAs Joe talked about with two-way text and same-day delivery and getting all those capabilities rolled out so that we can fulfill the way we want to fulfill.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nChris, this is Marvin. Just one last point on appliances. The work of our market delivery supply chain infrastructure is going to be significant not only in 2024, but for years to come. I mean, we're virtually the only national player that can deliver major appliances next day and two-day in virtually every zip code in the country. And that's significant. In addition to having same-day capacity for customers that have emergency purchases, we still have take-with inventory in virtually every store where a customer can come in and literally leave with an appliance within the hour. And so our model is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. And the brands that Bill and his team have brought to our assortment is something that we think will continue to work for us. And look, we'll work and manage through the macro environment.\nI think Bill and his team have done a really nice job, and we'll continue to listen to the consumer and pivot based on where they want us to go.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please just share your questions.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned big ticket still stays under pressure in DIY. We wondered if we could try and get our arms around that a little bit more in terms of how it compares the mix of what you were seeing pre-pandemic in terms of smaller versus larger projects. That question goes to the pro as well within the backlog. It sounds like you're seeing a stable backlog, but what are you seeing in terms of percentage of mix when it comes to those big ticket versus smaller ticket?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's",
    "content2": "Yeah. So Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill and Joe jump in on the second part. But if you think about the DIY consumer for a second, the consumer is healthy, and we feel good about the financial wherewithal of that consumer. They're simply choosing to leverage their spend in different places. As we've discussed, and it's not just us, but in all the different companies that talk about consumer spending, customers are just spending more of their wallet on experiences, on travel, on concerts, on restaurants because of this whole post-COVID relationship of getting back out and getting back to normal. And also, I don't think it's a surprise for us to say that customers purchased quite a few home-related goods during the pandemic. So we're still working through that cycle.\nHaving said that, we believe that we will work our way out of this macro environment at some point. We're not trying to call the timing on it. Our objective is to continue to invest in our business and execute at a high level. So whenever that consumer spend reverts back to normal, we're going to be in a perfect position to take advantage of it. One of the reasons why we launched our DIY loyalty program is specifically for the DIY consumer to give them some level of rationale to choose us over someone else and to create a level of differentiation in the marketplace, both in-store and online, so that we can be a preference for the DIY consumer.\nAnd so as we think about what they're buying and where we think that big ticket is going, I think it remains to be seen, but we feel good about what we're positioning for those consumers, and we'll wait on whatever timeframe occurs for them to change their spending habits.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Kate, I would just add that it really varies by product category. And so, as I said, with appliances, you've got really two spectrums going. You've got the value-conscious consumer looking at low-end pricing all the way to innovation, and we meet the customer across a variety of price points. And then you have the pro looking at their jobs, and we can meet them wherever they want to be met, whether that's on stock cabinets and having those products in our stores, again, across the multitude of price points that we offer in our stores and the different levels of product quality of product that we offer, both online and in-store. And as we get ready for spring, we have a lot of new product that we're excited about. And so you think about bigger ticket products like riding lawnmowers, walk-behind mowers.\nThe launch of Toro is a bigger ticket product. We're excited about that. Those are all new. Same thing with patio furniture. We introduced Origin 21. We introduced the Allen + Roth program. Those are bigger ticket products that she's looking to address and upgrade her outdoor spaces. So again, we want to meet her wherever she wants to be met. We want to be able to offer a variety of pricing to her based on how she wants to be met as she takes on these projects. That's what we're trying to do both online and in-store. We're excited about the readiness. We've worked really hard with our assortments that we offer both online and in-store.\nWe've worked really hard to make sure that we've got these variations across the country so that we're localized to address those needs across the different areas and geographies of our stores. And we're ready. We're ready for Mother Nature to cooperate, and we're ready to get going. So with that, Rob, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. So the final question will be from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please just do your questions.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Brandon, I wanted to just circle back to the same-store sales guidance, and I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about that second-half outlook in particular because it does embed a pretty big improvement on a one-year basis and then also on a multi-year basis from an FX perspective. So maybe just flesh out a bit what's really driving the improvement because you could arguably say that's not conservative in one view. Thank you.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Steve. Really, just when we look at the cadence of comps, I'm going to reaffirm my earlier comment. We expect the macro pressures, inflation, higher interest rates, and low housing turnover to persist. When we look specifically at the second half, we're cycling the easier compares as we comp over the DIY weakness that intensified in particular in Q3 of last year. To be clear, our comp improvement in the second half is not a result of any views on the improving macro, but purely reflective of easier year-over-year comparison. We looked at the cadence. We looked at it a lot of different ways. I would tell you on a two-year basis, which we leaned into pretty hard, two-year ex-lumber, there's a pretty consistent trajectory as we moved across the year.\nWe feel really comfortable with the full year, the breakdown, the comps, and the operating margin, and wanted to provide the right level of transparency and visibility to that.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up I had is just on the rural framework. Is there anything that's new this year as you think about the opportunity? And then when you think about the store portfolio more broadly, one of your peers has shifted to opening stores. Would you consider being a net opener of stores at some point in the future? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey, this is Marvin. I'll take that final part of your question. So on the new store openings, we're going to always look for what we describe as real estate voids around different parts of the country where we believe that we can get the right return on our capital for a new store investment. But candidly, I mean, our focus is on space productivity. We have such incredible upside opportunities in our stores to just invest capital in our existing infrastructure and create space productivity. We think the return on invested capital is significantly greater in using our dollars for that versus opening new stores with expensive real estate where we're struggling to get those investments to pencil.\nAnd again, we'll open a handful of stores for voids, but you're going to see us spend a ton of time on driving space productivity and creating greater value from the assets that we already own. And that's going to be our key focus. Relative to rural, we're extremely pleased with the performance of those 300-plus stores. When you think about categories like pet, things like clothing, and automotive, they're positively performing, outperform the company in most other merchandising categories. And you're going to see us start to expand some of those rural categories in non-rural locations around the country. We wanted to make sure that we learned enough about the consumer demand and enough about how we serve customers well. And Bill and Joe and their teams have done an exceptional job.\nYou're going to hear us continue to talk about this, but it's something that we're very pleased with, and you'll start to see it show up in more places around the portfolio of our stores.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you all for joining us today. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our Q1 earnings call in May.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Lowe's Q4 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect."

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores, and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website.\nDuring this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A, and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone. For the Q3, comparable sales declined 7.4%. Our results were driven by a greater-than-expected pullback in DIY discretionary spending, especially in bigger ticket categories. While we've seen a more cautious consumer for some time now, this quarter we saw some of these consumers increasingly prioritizing experiences over goods, spending on travel and entertainment. As a reminder, at Lowe's, 75% of our revenue is driven by DIY customers and 25% by pros, while the broader market mix is roughly 50% DIY and 50% pro. As a result, whenever the DIY customer becomes cautious, it disproportionately affects us. While we faced a softer DIY demand in the Q3, I'm pleased that at the same time we once again delivered positive sales comp and pro.\nNow, I'd like to take a moment to dig a bit deeper into our DIY performance for Q3. In categories like appliances, decor, flooring, and kitchen and bath, where we have strong DIY penetration, we saw increased pressure on sales of bigger ticket purchases like appliances, where consumers are postponing purchases if they can. For example, customers may have previously bought an entire kitchen suite, may now just buy a refrigerator. Keep in mind that the industry-wide pullback in appliance sales has a larger impact on Lowe's since we are the market leader in appliances in the US, with 14% of our sales coming from this category.\nLater in the call, Bill will discuss some of the initiatives we're implementing in Q4 to improve DIY performance with a more targeted effort to reach value-conscious customers, including our most competitive offers on single-unit appliance purchases ahead of the holiday season, and the launch of our Lowe's lowest price guarantees so our customers can shop with confidence knowing that they'll always find the best price at Lowe's. Despite the pullback in DIY, pros are still working, and many of their projects are a result of increased wear and tear on aging homes, which lead to unavoidable repairs. This continues to create project backlogs for small to medium-sized pros, who is our core customer. In our most recent survey, nearly 70% of pros reported healthy project backlogs, but given the uncertain macro environment, they're feeling a little less confident.\nAlthough pros may be a bit cautious in this environment, our ability to deliver a positive pro sales comp in the Q3 is a reflection that our strategy is working. We're making progress with the investments we've made over the last several years to improve our service offering, including increasing loyalty through our MVP Pro Rewards, developing a world-class CRM platform, improving job site delivery, enhancing service levels in our stores, creating a more seamless online experience, and a number of merchandising initiatives that Bill will discuss later in the call. Overall, we built a competitive pro sales and service model, which is creating a flywheel effect that will enable us to grow pro sales at 2x the pace of the market. Let's now turn to online sales, which declined 4% in the quarter as the same pressures in DIY bigger ticket categories impacted digital sales.\nNow, let's talk about what we're doing to manage this unique environment. In store operations, we've made foundational improvements to associate productivity that enable us to effectively align labor to demand while continuing to serve our customers. During the quarter, we leveraged these new capabilities to reduce operating expenses while enhancing the customer experience for both pro and DIY customers at the same time. Joe will provide more detail on these initiatives and our improved customer service scores later in the call. I'm pleased that our disciplined focus on expense management across the organization contributed to a 46 basis points increase in operating margin rate compared to adjusted operating margin in the prior year, despite the sales decline, which led to diluted earnings per share of $3.06.\nAs we explore ways to drive improved sales with our DIY customers, I'd like to provide you with an update on two initiatives: our new Lowe's Outlet stores and our rural strategy. Let me start with our Lowe's Outlet stores. We opened our 15th Lowe's Outlet location in Q3. With these smaller format stores, we can leverage lower-cost real estate in trade areas closest to our core customer without cannibalizing a nearby Lowe's store. In an environment where DIY consumers are seeking value, we're pleased with the customer response and the overall performance of our outlet locations. These stores complement our market delivery network, allowing us to offer savings between 25% to 70% off on big and bulky scratch-and-dent items like appliances, patio furniture, and grills, all while maximizing profitability and offering our customers enhanced value.\nWe look forward to discussing the potential growth opportunities of this strategy on an upcoming call. Turning to our rural strategy, this one-stop shop concept is designed to give customers located in rural areas across the country everything they need for their home and farm, including a wide offering of farm, ranch, and outdoor products. During the summer, we launched this rural assortment to over 300 stores, where we're selling products like livestock feed, pet food, utility vehicles, and apparel from brands like Carhartt and Wrangler. These programs include a Petco store within a store, which enhances the total home solution we offer by bringing together home improvement and pet care services, products, and expertise under one roof. We're pleased to see this new initiative already gaining traction with strong performance in pet, apparel, and automotive.\nIn fact, these rural customers are our best-performing DIY segment, and these stores are performing significantly above the company average. Given this initial success, we're now exploring expanding this rural assortment beyond the original 300 designated rural stores. In addition, we're planning to add incremental merchandising initiatives within these original 300 stores because the customer is responding favorably to these new assortments and product lines. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our merchandising and marketing efforts that highlight the everyday value at Lowe's for our price-sensitive customers. And we'll continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives within our Total Home Strategy as we strive to become a world-class omnichannel retailer. And as I wrap up, let me say that we remain bullish on the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry, supported by favorable housing and demographic trends.\nWe expect home prices to be supported by persistent supply-demand imbalance of housing, while at the same time, 250,000 millennial household formations are expected per year through 2025, and their parents and grandparents, the baby boomers, increasingly prefer to age in place in their own homes. And we cannot overlook the fact that we now have the oldest housing stock in US history, with the median age of homes now 41 years old, which will need ongoing investments in repair and remodel projects. These factors continue to reinforce our optimism about the mid to long-term outlook for our industry. In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their continued hard work and dedication to serving customers and our communities. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Despite a pullback in DIY discretionary demand, we are pleased that we delivered positive pro comps this quarter as our enhanced product and brand offerings continue to resonate with the pro. Over the past several years, we've added the brands that pros want, and we have invested in the inventory quantities pros need, and we continue to tailor our product assortments to local building codes and preferences. These investments continue to pay off even in a more challenging macro environment, where we remain laser-focused on highlighting everyday value and convenience both in our stores and online to a price-conscious consumer. Turning to our results in building products, we continue to serve our resilient pro customer, who remains active, especially on repair and maintenance projects. We delivered positive comps in building materials, partly driven by strong performance in pro-heavy categories like roofing and drywall.\nWe also delivered comps above the company average in rough plumbing, largely driven by positive comps in water heaters, demonstrating that Lowe's is the go-to solution for critical repair needs. This quarter, Klein Tools returned home to Lowe's. This trusted brand is the number one tool brand for electrical and HVAC professionals, and we are thrilled to now offer the largest assortment of Klein Tools in the home improvement retail channel. Our pro customers' response to our relaunch of Klein Tools has exceeded our expectations, and we're excited about our plans to expand this iconic brand to support the unique needs of these trade professionals. Now, let's shift gears to home decor, which was most heavily impacted by lower DIY project-related demand. And as you heard from Marvin, this had a greater impact in categories like appliances, flooring, and kitchens and bath.\nWithin appliances, we are seeing lower industry unit volumes as well as the reintroduction of pre-pandemic levels of vendor-funded promotion, which puts pressure on average selling price. While our results in kitchens and bath were also impacted by softer DIY demand, we are seeing our private brand products gaining traction as the consumer continues to look for value, like with our new Allen + Roth butcher block countertops. These are made of solid FSC-certified wood, and this stylish product is a cost-effective way to refresh your kitchen, bar, or studio. This item has been so popular that we are now doubling our sales expectations. Turning to paint, we delivered comps above company average in the quarter, largely driven by the pro who paints, who relies on Lowe's as a one-stop shop for their project needs.\nWe continue to look for opportunities to expand our product offering, including a recent launch of an exclusive line of Sherwin-Williams primers from HGTV Home . These new primers, designed for the pro who paints, give them a versatile, multi-surface application that makes it easier to work on both interior and exterior projects. Shifting gears to hardlines. In addition to a broad-based DIY pullback, we also saw pressure in categories impacted by storm-related activity, such as generators, gas cans, fuel, and chainsaws, as we cycled Hurricane Ian from last year. We delivered comps above company average in lawn and garden as our customers engaged in smaller fall cleanup projects. We also drove comps above company average in hardware led by key pro categories like fasteners, safety equipment, and cleaning products. Lastly, we continue to build out our brand portfolio, like with our new strategic partnership with the Toro Company.\nTheir exciting product lineup further complements what is now the strongest brand offering in outdoor power equipment, one that resonates with both the Pro and DIY customer who relies on Lowe's to offer the best selection. We're looking forward to launching Toro ahead of our upcoming spring season and building on our momentum as the leading retailer of outdoor power equipment. In response to the customer's increased focus on value, I'd like to talk about how we are highlighting some of the ways that customers can save time and money during this holiday season.\nFor starters, we recently kicked off our holiday campaign with a commitment to supporting shoppers in new ways all season long, which includes a wave of exciting offers and new deals every week on great gift ideas, including power tools from some of the best brands like DeWalt, Craftsman, and Kobalt, and pre-lit Christmas trees trimmed with the innovative, energy-saving LED lighting. Our customers can also look forward to same-day delivery on key holiday and home improvement items, as well as services like holiday light hanging for the home through Angi. As Marvin mentioned, we recently launched our new Lowe's Lowest Price Guarantee to remind customers that not only can they expect a great shopping experience, but they'll also receive the lowest price on items for their home. In fact, customers can now find our lowest prices of the year on select major appliances.\nIn an effort to simplify the offer and make it easier to understand, we're offering $100 off for every $800 a customer spends. For our pros, we have tailored exclusive bulk-saving offers on appliances as well. To drive even greater excitement and traffic on Black Friday, we will feature more than 10 major appliance doorbusters. We are excited to deliver what we think will be the most compelling offers in the market. In addition to these great deals, Lowe's is now offering Carhartt apparel online and in select stores. This iconic workwear brand makes a perfect gift for the pro this holiday. Before I close, I'd like to highlight just a few of the perpetual productivity improvements, or PPI, workstreams that are underway in merchandising. Our teams continue to make progress in our three main focus areas: product cost management, inventory productivity, and pricing and promotional strategies.\nWe continue to partner with our suppliers to take costs out, especially now that transportation and commodity costs have come down. We are expanding our private brand portfolio, which delivers great quality and value at a lower price to our customers while also driving better margin rate productivity. Our teams are working hard to ensure that customers have the best value every day at Lowe's, while also delivering productivity for the organization. As I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation once again to our vendors and our merchants for their hard work, dedication, and ongoing partnership. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their ongoing efforts to deliver excellent customer service. As Marvin mentioned, we were able to reduce operating expenses this quarter while at the same time delivering a 200 basis points improvement in DIY customer satisfaction scores and a 300 basis points improvement for the pro. This represents the ongoing benefit of our foundational technology investments designed to modernize our store's operational process and simplify our associates' jobs while also creating a great shopping environment for our customers. Let me highlight just a few of these changes. For starters, we created an industry-leading customer-centric scheduling system, which allows us to predict customer demand and align staffing around peak customer traffic for each store and each department. This system creates enhanced operational agility so we can rapidly adjust as demand patterns shift.\nSecond, we've enabled greater productivity by putting mobile smart devices in all of our associates' hands to make them more efficient, reducing manual tasking and enabling faster customer service. For example, by integrating smart devices with our new store inventory management system, or SIMs, our associates can find products 40% faster. Through Project Simple, we've eliminated duplicative tasks and reduced non-productive hours so we can repurpose associate time from tasking to selling and service. A third foundational improvement is the expansion of our merchandising services team, or MST. This team keeps our shelves stocked, and they recently assumed responsibilities for price changes across the store and watering in the garden center.\nMST is now leveraging a new app that directs them to serve a specific base based on the rate of sales, making their hard work even more productive and freeing up more time for our red vest associates to spend with customers. Another important aspect of delivering excellent customer experience is convenience. That's why we're making a number of enhancements to create a more convenient shopping experience ahead of the holiday season. For example, we're extending our same-day delivery to in-store purchases through our gig network to both pro and DIY customers. And in certain locations, we'll even be delivering live Christmas trees to our customers' doors, saving them the hassle of getting it home themselves.\nThis new gig delivery capability, which we first rolled out on Lowe's.com, enables us to tap into the OneRail network of 12 million drivers to deliver directly to Pro job sites and customer homes in just a matter of hours. Our store operations team is also focused on unlocking even more productivity through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives, or PPI. This past quarter, we fully retired the old self-checkout systems and have shifted to the proprietary self-checkout systems that we built for the home improvement shopper. We've seen greater customer adoption of these new systems since they're so much easier to use. In fact, our front-end transformation is well underway, with approximately 450 stores planned by the end of this year.\nOver a three-year timeline, we're revamping the checkout experience across all of our stores and increasing the selling space at the front, where we're adding more merchandise right at checkout with a new design that makes it easy to showcase grab-and-go items. With this front-end transformation, we're shifting to an easy-to-use assisted self-checkout with cashiers who will be right there to answer questions and help customers when they need it. Finally, we're tripling the staging area for buy online pickup and store orders to support increased online sales and create a much faster, easier customer experience, building on our momentum when it comes to driving improved customer service scores for these orders. At the same time, we're excited to launch omni-selling in our stores, a critical milestone in our journey to become a world-class omnichannel retailer.\nEnabled by our new store operating system, we can now easily sell our endless aisle on Lowe's.com within the aisles of our stores. For example, let's say a customer is shopping for new faucets and browsing our selection of the most popular finishes in the store. While talking with an associate, they decide to go with a unique finish from Lowe's.com that the associate highlights on their mobile device. The associate then saves the faucet in the customer's digital cart with their phone number, and the customer can continue shopping in the store. When the customer is ready to check out, all the cashier needs to do to combine the digital and physical purchases is pull up the digital cart using the customer's phone number.\nWe're still in the early innings here, but we know this is a great opportunity to drive our omnichannel sales and make sure our customers get everything they need to complete their project in one shopping trip. As I close, I would like to thank all of our store leaders and associates once again for their hard work serving customers and delivering results each and every day. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our Q3 results, we generated diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Please note in the prior year, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $2.1 billion associated with our Canadian retail business. Now, my comments from this point will reference comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year where applicable. Q3 sales were $20.5 billion. For reference, prior year sales included $1.2 billion generated in our Canadian retail business. Additionally, Q3 results include a $115 million sales headwind due to the shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. Comp sales were down 7.4% as a slowdown in DIY bigger ticket spending offset growth in Pro. Q3 comps were negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to lumber deflation.\nAs a reminder, the calendar shift impacted total sales growth but had no impact on comparable sales as comps are calculated based on weeks 28 through 40 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was down 0.5% driven by lumber deflation, more normalized appliance promotions, and a decline in big ticket DIY transactions. However, average ticket still increased in the majority of our merchandise categories. Comp transactions declined 6.9% driven by softer demand in DIY discretionary projects, partly offset by positive comp transactions in pro. Our monthly comps were down 6.3% in August, 8.3% in September, and 7.3% in October as DIY traffic slowed as we exited our peak seasonal weeks. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the Q3, up 36 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from our ongoing merchandising PPI initiatives as well as favorable product mix and lower transportation costs.\nThis was partially offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network. Consistent with our year-to-date performance, shrink was in line with prior year. SG&A of 18.4% levered 30 basis points versus prior year adjusted SG&A, demonstrating our enterprise-wide agility to manage expenses and drive productivity in a lower sales environment. These results would not have been possible without the exceptional efforts of our store leadership teams to rapidly respond to the sales pressure, as well as the ongoing benefits that we are harvesting from our technology-led PPI initiatives. Operating margin rate of 13.2% improved by 46 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 24.6% in line with prior year adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $17.5 billion, down $2.3 billion compared to Q3 of last year.\nUS inventory dollars and units were both down compared to last year as we align inventory purchases with sales. Turning now to our capital allocation. During the quarter, we generated $485 million in free cash flow. We repurchased 7.3 million shares for $1.6 billion and paid $642 million in dividends at $1.10 per share, returning $2.2 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $579 million as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities within our Total Home Strategy. Adjusted debt to EBITDA finished the quarter at 2.72 times, in line with our stated 2.75 times leverage target. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 35%, inclusive of an unfavorable 125 basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the gain we reported in Q1. Now, turning to our 2023 financial outlook.\nGiven the recent pullback in DIY bigger ticket discretionary spending and the uncertainty surrounding the macro factors that impact our business, we are updating our full year 2023 financial outlook. With this in mind, we are now forecasting Q4 comp sales to be fairly consistent with Q3 results. Also, the Q4 of 2022 included approximately $1.4 billion in sales from the additional 53rd week. We are now expecting 2023 sales of approximately $86 billion with a comparable sales decline of approximately 5%. We also now expect adjusted operating margin of approximately 13.3% as our ongoing PPI initiatives and discipline expense management help to offset volume deleverage pressure from lower sales. Additionally, we expect full year interest expense of approximately $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of up to $2 billion, and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 25%.\nThis results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $13. Please note that our outlook for operating margin and diluted earnings per share are adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian business that we recorded in Q1. Finally, we are reconfirming our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to invest in the business to take market share, target a 35% dividend payout ratio, and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases, which will be funded in the near term through free cash flow. And in closing, I'm confident that our continued investments in our Total Home Strategy, our strong balance sheet, and our ability to effectively manage our business in any environment will allow us to navigate the near-term challenges while continuing to deliver sustainable shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We are now ready for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press star two. In order to allow questions to as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGood morning. Marvin, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the 300 rural stores comping above average, and some of those categories being the best-performing ones. So, curious if you maybe help reframe how you guys are thinking through the more medium-term and longer-term opportunity there. How many stores do you think can accommodate such an assortment, and any contextualization of the spread in the DIY comp in the 300 stores versus the company average?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey, Steve, thanks for the question. We're not going to get into that level of specificity for competitive reasons, but what I will tell you is that the rural stores have exceeded expectations. And as we noted, we started out with roughly 300, but candidly, the performance and the customer response has been such that we're now looking at a couple of different options. One option is we're going into those original 300 and we're adding incremental investments, initiatives, categories based on feedback from customers. We're also looking at categories that are working really well in those rural stores and asking the question, can we now take some of these categories and put them in non-rural format locations because we believe we could get the same response from customers in non-rural environments?\nThen thirdly, we're just looking at expanding our profile and definition of rural because some of these characteristics we think can fit other locations. Because of the response and because of the DIY customer being such a critical component of our company strategy, we think this makes a really good strategic rationale and is something that we're pursuing. Again, we'll speak more about this on future calls, but I don't want to get into more specifics for obvious competitive reasons.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThen maybe sticking with some initiatives here, maybe a follow-up for Bill. The front-end transformation, we're probably far enough right into it where it'd be helpful if you maybe frame the ROI of such transformations. I don't know if you can sort of maybe go through what you're seeing in terms of comp lift and/or just what is the outlook right for next year as we think through the maturation benefit of such an agenda.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. So as Joe said, we've got roughly 450 stores that we'll complete by the end of the year. We continue to test and learn in these stores. As you can imagine, there's opportunities for us to try some additional merchandising opportunities up front of the store. It's all about getting another item in the basket. And there's opportunities in the obvious areas like snacks and drinks, but we're also looking at other categories as well that can complement what we're doing and also that shopper, both a pro and a do-it-yourselfer that's making that transaction in our store that could pick that kind of stuff up. And you think about aspirin, Band-Aids, stuff like that that could complement what they're doing and could be used on a job site or in a glove box of a car at your home.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nAnd Steve, the other thing that I'll add is this also complements the ongoing omni expansion that Joe talked about. As we extend these capabilities of connecting digital and physical stores, we need more productive space, and we need to just optimize all the things that the associates are doing to accommodate and fulfill those orders. As Joe mentioned, part of this is to create more designated space in a more productive fashion for that process, but also it's creating a much better customer experience, and it's also driving a lot of productivity for Joe's team in the store.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi, good morning, guys. Thanks for your question. Just kind of curious as you talk a lot about the PPI initiatives and your ability to kind of be agile with expenses. If we think kind of longer term, think maybe out to next year, if there's another environment where comps for sales are maybe down in the mid-single-digit range, how do we think about your ability to manage margins in that environment? I know some of the benefit this year is cycling Canada, but just maybe some benchmarks to think about as we move to next year on how the P&L could act in different top-line environments. Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Hey, Peter. This is Brandon. Just in terms of as we're looking at 2024, we're in the later stages of our planning process at the moment across the organization. So we're going to hold off on providing any in-depth guidance until our Q4 call. But what I will tell you just in terms of top-line macro home improvement is continued uncertainty on interest rates, when we're going to see relief, when existing home sales are going to turn the corner and begin to improve, and obviously the ongoing impact of inflation, higher rates on consumer wallets. So we're watching all that. I think to your specific question on margins, we're managing several puts and takes as we look at next year. We're cycling one-time legal settlements, normalization of incentive comp, wage growth, and the pacing of our PPI initiative. So we're looking at all that.\nWe're going to take all those factors under consideration as we develop our guide and hold off on providing that until we get to February.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nPeter, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is you heard in some of the prepared comments us talking about an old operating system. We've talked a lot about this 30-year-old operating system that's really been a significant impediment to some of the technology advancements. We're going to be sunsetting that system at the end of this year. It's going to just unlock a little bit of acceleration in some of the technology advancements that we have on the project list that we just candidly couldn't get to because of this system.\nAnd so the good news is we're going to continue to work, to Brandon's point, on all the elements of running and improved business from a merchandising store operation, supply chain, but also the technology project list over the next three to five years is robust, and it's going to allow us to continue to find ways to drive profitability irrespective of the macro environment that we're in. We're hoping the macro environment gets better, but to Brandon's point, we're going to wait until our Q4 call to talk about 2024 and give a much more educated perspective at that time.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nFair enough. Appreciate that perspective. I guess my follow-up would be just around maybe the cost environment that you're seeing out there. A lot of talk of, obviously, disinflation and some outright deflation in certain areas. What are you seeing right now in terms of the cost you're receiving from your suppliers, and how do you kind of view that as we look out over the next few quarters? Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Peter, this is Brandon. I would say just in terms of costs coming into the organization at this point, just from an inflation price action response to that, it's leveled off pretty dramatically here as we move through the year. We've had targets in terms of clawback for this year. We laid those expectations out back in December, I would say, very much pacing in line with those targets. We laid out about $500 million over the course of three years. We're leveraging cost management teams, working closely with the merchants, the tech-enabled tools that we've invested in. We have very detailed product cost breakdowns that are informing those negotiations with our suppliers. So we're continuing to be balanced. We're taking a portfolio approach. We're investing in price strategically where needed, but also looking through the lens of protecting our margins.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nUnderstood. Thanks so much, guys. Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Peter.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, Peter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next questions are from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I want to try to take another stab at this margin question for next year. I know there's not a whole lot you can provide. If you think about the levers that you have, do you lose any for next year? I realize you're going to lap the legal settlement in the first part of the year. And then connected to it, as you manage your selling expenses, do you think that's having an impact on sales at all? Meaning, is that not something you press on as hard for next year?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Simeon, this is Brandon. I wouldn't say when we look at next year, we're losing the benefit of any of those levers. In fact, I think we're looking at where we have opportunities to accelerate. We've talked about PPI, talked about where we were in that journey in terms of middle innings. Marvin mentioned the conversion of the store technology to a modern omnichannel platform. We got a lot of initiatives stacked up where we expect to see those benefits as that gets delivered next year. Earlier question on transforming the front end, really expanding assisted checkout, expanding the BOPUS experience, and then Bill talked in his prepared comments about multiple other kind of merchandising PPI initiatives, whether it's cost clawback, inventory productivity, pricing, promotional strategies, expansion of private brands. So we're really confident in that portfolio of initiatives. We feel like it's in our control.\nWe're managing the roadmap and the pacing of that and have a lot of confidence as we look at the longer-term margins that we can deliver against our stated targets there.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll add this perspective. The reason why we call this a perpetual productivity improvement initiative is because we're trying to stay away from one-time events. We think that good companies create an ongoing sustained process of improvement and productivity gains. And so we have a roadmap of initiatives. It's important that it's not just about store operations. You heard Bill talk about the PPI initiative specifically for merchandising. If Don Frieson was here, he could speak specifically to supply chain. And Samantha could speak specifically for IT. And so this is a culture that we've created here that candidly did not exist, but the key word is perpetual.\nAnd that means that it's ongoing, it's consistent, and it's sustainable. And so as we look at 2024, even though we're not going to get into the details, what Brandon is reinforcing is that we have a list of things that we're going to do. We're well aware of what we're overlapping. We understand some of the one-time factors we're going to face. And we've built processes, initiatives in place to address that. And we'll be more transparent and more detailed in our Q4 call because we think it's really important to lay out to you all exactly how we see it and the steps we're going to take.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nMy gentle follow-up to that, Marvin, is you have OpEx, productivity, and PPI. Those are the two biggest unlocks. Just to clarify or an assumption, it doesn't sound like what the business comps has anything to do on what those two buckets produce. Then is there a situation in which those two buckets actually produce more in terms of sequencing in 2024 than what it was yielding in 2023?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo I'll give you the perspective of a long-term operator. If we get the top line, PPI works a whole lot better. So irrespective, we're going to intensify the focus. Obviously, if we have a softer top-line perspective, we're going to be a lot more aggressive in the PPI side. But irrespective of our comp outlook, PPI is going to be in existence, and we're going to work really hard to make sure that we hit some of the key targets that we lay out. And again, you have our commitment that as we lay out 2024, as best we can, we'll be as transparent as possible about all these things in our February call.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Thank you, Simeon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next questions are from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nManaging Director of Global Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys. I want to focus a bit on the top line. You've seen increased big-ticket sensitivity. Others are talking about, you mentioned flooring. People are doing smaller projects. You're not buying the suite of appliances. You're doing the bathroom, not the entire first floor in flooring. I guess, so my question is, why isn't the pro and the remodel business, or maybe the remodel business, and the answer is different from you on the pro because it's share, but why isn't the remodel business and the pro business the next shoe to drop? And given the changes that you've seen over the past three or four months, how are you thinking about the bottom of the comp cycle, and sort of when does it start to revert back to positive?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo Chris, I'll take the first part of that. Then I'm going to just let Bill Boltz talk about some of the initiatives relative to addressing some of the top-line concerns. So specific on sales for us, when we look at the quarter, we look at it from a penetration, from a DIY perspective, and a product mix. So as a reminder, 14% of our revenue comes from appliances. So when you have pullback on some of these big-ticket categories like appliances, it's going to be disproportionately impactful for us. Having said that, we look at the pro, and to your point, we had a positive comp, and we're really pleased with that and I went through some of the investments we've made over the course of the last four years that we believe are paying dividends relative to that specific small to medium pro.\nThe reason we think that that specific segment of pro will remain healthy, although cautious, as we noted from our survey, is because of the age of homes. I mean, it is a foregone conclusion that if you have a house over 40 years old, things are going to break and when those things break and those repairs are required, that small to medium contractor is typically the one that's going to get that call and these pros are incredibly transparent with us. And 70% say they feel really good about their backlog but they also said that when they watch the news and they read the headlines, they're a little cautious because they just don't know what's lurking around the corner. But they're busy because these homes are old. These homes are not turning. So people are living in these homes.\nAnd so that's really the driver of that customer segment remaining healthy and busy. And look, we can't predict the bottom. But what we can say is that we're incredibly disciplined. Anytime you can deliver a 46 basis point improvement operating margin on a -7.4 comp, it tells you that there are a lot of really things working from a productivity standpoint that drives margin rate improvement and basis point improvement in customer service that we're really proud of. So we feel good about the execution of the team. And we can't predict kind of what's going to happen when, but we can say whenever it happens, we're well-positioned to take advantage of it.\nI'll pivot to Bill just to talk about kind of what we're trying to do to remain agile, and to try to make sure that we are driving a business environment that's attracting DIY customers and keeping these pros coming back also.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thanks, Marvin. And Chris, just some of the things that we've talked about really over the last few quarters that I'm pleased with the work that the team has done is the continued acquiring of brands and making sure that we've got relevant assortments inside of our stores and online. And so we announced today Toro as part of our outdoor power equipment. We talked about Klein last quarter, and we're just starting to get that brand now into the electrical and the tool category. So that's excitement for us. We talked about localized assortments, and Marvin touched briefly on the rural strategy. That's just one element of a localized opportunity. And then we continue to try to pivot to where the customer is.\nSo as we've seen some of this softening in appliances from an industry-wide standpoint, because we're the industry leader here, we want to make sure that we can meet the customer where they want us to meet them. That's adjusting. We feel like the adjustments the teams have made to make sure that we can go after the 100,000+ appliances that break in the United States every single week, that we're there when the consumer needs us, both online and in store. We continue to enhance our fundamentals and our foundation online. Offering Apple Pay as a way to make it easier for the customer to transact online is just one element, same-day delivery. Then obviously being seasonally relevant.\nAs we go into this Friday with Black Friday, it's about making sure that we've got strong offers out there that get the customer to the door and to the website. That's the stuff that we'll continue to do. At the same time, we have to be competitively priced. We've got to be relevant every single day. So that's the kind of work that the team continues to stay focused on. It takes time, obviously, to get that customer to know that these changes have happened inside of our store and online. We're just going to stay focused on what we can control.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nManaging Director of Global Research, JPMorgan\n\nAnd then my follow-up is, again, on the Pro side, as you think about the momentum in that business over this year or what you're seeing in the basket in terms of the projects that they're doing, whether it's size or price point, price spectrum, is there any change in momentum on the Pro side of the business?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's",
    "content2": "Chris, thanks for the question. Listen, we can tell you that with the Pro loyalty and CRM that we launched, we continue to view the basket. We continue to view the mix. We are very encouraged and continue to exceed expectation in the core metrics. We continue to launch new capabilities, things like online quotes for the bulk pricing that Bill talked about. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned the integrated same-day gig delivery, streamlined order tracking. So there's a lot going into that Pro from an effort standpoint. We continue to be pleased at the progress.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nManaging Director of Global Research, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Have a great Thanksgiving. Thanks very much.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next questions are from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow up on pricing and promotional activity. Obviously, you talked about elevated promotions and appliances and how that's being funded by vendors. I realize that category is a little bit unique, but how would you categorize discounting activity across other categories? And maybe you could also just elaborate on what you have seen and what you've been doing with that Lowe's Lowest Price Guarantee. Thank you.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Seth, it's Bill. And so just a couple of things here. As I said, we are seeing probably more of a move on pre-pandemic levels of promotions, specifically in the appliance area. These are largely vendor-supported, but we want to make sure that we're there, obviously, and we're part of all that. As it relates to the overall, the industry remains pretty rational and pretty stable. You want to make sure that at certain times of the year, you're out there with the relevant offers and that you're doing the things that you need to do. So whether that's in the spring or this Black Friday, we're excited about having some of those offers out there and working within the guardrails and the profitability targets that we've established. But all in all, it remains, I think, relatively rational. I think the consumer is looking for value.\nSo we've got to find different ways to highlight value. Those are the things that this team is doing. Value can come a lot of ways outside of just a reduction in price. You can highlight it through new and innovative products. You can highlight it through a special offer if that's what comes out, or you can do it through a vendor-funded promotion. So those are the things that we're trying to take advantage of.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. And Seth, this is Brandon. I would just add the adjustments that Bill was talking about that we're making as the consumer's changing as we're moving through the year, our go-to-market strategy, all of that's fully embedded and reflected in our updated outlook and confidence that we're able to achieve our flat gross margins for the year.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nAnd Seth, on the low-price guarantee, our research just indicated that we needed a more simplistic, straightforward message to the customers about our value. We had something that was a little too cute called a price promise that I think was way too ambiguous and we just decided just to keep it simple and stand by the fact that we will support the lowest price in the industry on the products that we sell. We just launched it.\nWe think the timing is perfect going into the holiday season where you have a slightly cautious consumer looking for a value. And so you take everything that Bill said about the definition of value and the fact that we're going to put media behind this lowest price guarantee. We hope that sends a message to the consumer that they can always expect the lowest price at Lowe's.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you for that. That's very helpful. I did have one follow-up on capital allocation, specifically share repurchases. Just based on what you've done year to date, where leverage sits today, how do you think about the pace of buybacks from here? Should we be thinking about that starting to slow into the Q4 and even over the next couple of quarters based on the demand backdrop? How do we think about that?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSeth, this is Brandon. Our capital allocation priority is unchanged. We're going to continue to invest in the business in high-return projects, targeting a 35% dividend payout ratio, and funneling the remainder to share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect funding of share repurchases through operating cash flow here in the near term and expect modest, if any, share repo in Q4. We also expect to be in line with our stated leverage target at the end of the year. We're also looking at our debt maturities, paying those off as they mature. We had $500 million this past Q3. We have $450 million coming due in 2024. We remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and expect to manage our leverage accordingly.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. And have a nice holiday.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Seth.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the importance of sales to the PPI initiative, if you're looking at, call it, another down five comp next year, do you start to become more aggressive with promotions or other actions in order to start to drive sales because you'll get a return on it in other ways?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, Michael, we're not going to get into 2024 at this time. We'll speak more specifically about that on the Q4 call. What I'll just repeat is PPI is perpetual for a reason. We're going to keep doing it. It's sustainable. It's ongoing. And we're going to be agile. We'll take the necessary steps to make sure we're running a really sound business, thinking first about driving service for the customers and giving our associates a great place to work. But other than that, PPI will be in place irrespective of top line, and we'll adjust it accordingly.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. My follow-up question is, Marvin, as you look at your sales by market, by region, and tie to the underlying housing characteristics and dynamics in those markets, where are you seeing better trends and where are you seeing worse trends such that it informs how you think about how the rest of this cycle is going to unfold from here? It's likely at some point, hopefully, housing turnover is going to pick up. That could bode well for home improvement demand. But if it comes with a corresponding tick down in home prices, that could be not so good for home improvement demand.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nNo, Michael, it's a fair question. If you strip out storm overlaps, geographically, our performance is relatively balanced. So there are really no outliers. When you look at markets that had a dramatic run-up in housing costs and some level of moderation, there's really no material impact to our business based on that. Obviously, it's something that we stay very close to. We're paying attention to it. But as of right now, it's not material, and we don't see it as something that's going to affect our business in the near term.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you and have a great holiday.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So a couple of questions on top line. I'm just going to merge them together. But first off, a bit of a follow-up, just on appliances. So Marvin, you talked about maybe some normalization and overall promotion vendor-led. I guess the question I have on appliances: are you seeing anything shift in the market? I mean, obviously, we're against very fluid demand backdrop. Are you seeing anything shift from a competitive standpoint? And then my second question, just with respect to the underlying cadence of the business. So we saw what appears to be a weakening trend through the fiscal Q3, then presumably here into the Q4.\nThere's some seasonal factors there, but is there anything else you can really call out that you can identify as kind of a driver of that weakening trend in the overall business? Thank you.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nMichael, I'll take both and just allow Brandon or Bill to jump in if they have any additional comments. On the appliance shift, I mean, we're not seeing anything other than what Bill talked about, where you have vendor-funded promotions kind of driving average ticket down. Also, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we're seeing customers being just a little more specific on their purchases, going from an entire suite to just a refrigerator, as an example. I think that's just the cautious nature of the DIY discretionary spending on some of these bigger ticket categories we talked about. We are the market leader in the US in appliances. As I mentioned earlier, 14% of our annual revenue is predicated to appliances. So when the market is soft, we have a disproportionate impact. Having said that, we feel great about our market-leading position.\nAs Bill outlined, we have some competitive offers on single-unit purchases for the holiday season. That's the best in the industries. So we feel like we're in a good place relative to the marketplace. On weakening trends, there's not anything we can put our finger on it. I mean, you know all the macro indicators with the resumption of student loan debt and sustained inflation, interest rates. I just think that those things, combined with the fact that people are just choosing to take discretionary dollars and have more experiences with those dollars, is really leading into some of the things that we're seeing. When those discretionary categories are impacted, those are typically DIY-related purchases. Again, at 75% penetration in DIY, we just have a disproportionate impact to that.\nI'll let Brandon or Bill add anything else if they have it in addition to what I just said.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThe only thing that I would add, Brian, is that just as I said earlier, just the reminder that over 100,000 units of appliances break in the marketplace every week. We've got to be there for that consumer as the market leader. That's what we're trying to do. Do that in a responsible manner to make sure that we can hit all the financial targets that we need to hit, but also make sure that we can meet the customer where they want to be met, both online and in store.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. And Brian, just to wrap it up in terms of how we are looking at Q4, I think our outlook largely is a continuation of the macro and the traffic trends that we've experienced in Q3. We do expect a slight impact from lumber deflation as we transition into Q4. All of the offers that Bill has talked about with appliance holiday offers are reflected in there. We do expect some light pressure from cycling Hurricane Ian. So we've triangulated all that. We've looked at one, two, and four-year trends. All of that's sort of baked into the expectations that we set. And we believe it's very achievable for us here for Q4.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you, guys. Appreciate all the color. Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving and a wonderful holiday season. We look forward to speaking with you on our Q4 earnings call in February.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the Lowe's Q3 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores, and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A, and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. For the Q2, comparable sales declined 1.6%. Our results were driven by a strong spring recovery combined with continued growth in pro and online, which helped to offset softer DIY discretionary spending and 160 basis points of pressure from lumber deflation. Q2 also reflected the importance of our ongoing investments in our total home strategy. Despite an uncertain macro, these investments are paying off with positive comps in pro and 6.9% comparable sales growth online as we continue to improve our omnichannel experience.\nWe're pleased that our core pro customer, the small to mid-size pro, remains resilient and continues to respond to our expanded national brands, MVPs Pro Rewards program, and enhanced online tools. In our most recent survey, nearly 75% of pros reported healthy project backlogs and lead volumes remain consistent with recent quarters. This quarter, we launched a new same-day delivery option on lowes.com and our mobile app powered by OneRail, enabling us to tap into their network of 12 million drivers to deliver directly to pro job sites and consumer homes in a matter of hours.\nThis new capability allows us to leverage our 1,700-plus store footprint to make those much-needed last-minute deliveries to pro job sites, saving them both time and money. Our expanded same-day delivery capability is the latest of many examples of how we are meeting our customers where they are and making home improvement shopping faster and more convenient for both pro and DIY customers. We're also making strides in the rollout of our market delivery model for big and bulky products, with 13 geographic regions now supporting more than 1,200 stores, and we are on track to complete the initial rollout by the end of the year.\nAs we invest in what will drive our future growth, we remain disciplined in improving productivity through our Perpetual Productivity Improvement Initiatives, or PPI. In Q2, operating margin expanded 18 basis points, leading to a diluted earnings per share of $4.56. A common misperception we hear is that our productivity journey must be close to its end, as we've driven significant operating margin leverage since beginning our transformation five years ago. But the reality is we still have a lot of opportunity ahead. We're in the final phases of sunsetting our 30-year-old operating system.\nIn addition to the productivity benefits of using intuitive touchscreens instead of hard-to-navigate green screens, this conversion gives us the modern foundation needed to quickly build and scale new omnichannel capabilities for the future. We also continue to leverage our penetration of rural stores to drive sales productivity. We run these stores with a low expense base than the rest of our portfolio, and our ability to generate outsized operating margin leverage on sales growth is unique. Specifically, the expansion of our rural product assortment, combined with the implementation of our PPI initiatives, makes our rural and remote stores a competitive advantage for our company.\nBeyond the productivity initiatives underway in stores, our leaders across all functional areas are executing against dozens of PPI workstreams to deliver sustained operating margin improvement. One example of this is in our supply chain, where we are driving greater throughput with new mobile applications combined with automation and robotics to improve productivity, maximize speed, and minimize damages. We're piloting a new Breakpack process, which leverages automation to break down cases five times faster, making it far more efficient to replenish stores. As we drive productivity, we also continue to focus on sustainability as the two often go hand in hand.\nWe recently published our 20th corporate responsibility report, spotlighting our path to net-zero emissions along with our investments in our associates and communities. As we speak with investors, many of your questions are centered on the macro environment. As a reminder, the two strongest demand drivers of our business are real disposable personal income and home price appreciation, and they are most supportive of demand when they pull in tandem. Home price appreciation has slowed but is still up 35% versus pre-pandemic, while real disposable income has been pressured by persistent inflation and elevated interest rates.\nBut on a positive note, over the past quarter, growth in real disposable income started to improve and realign with long-term trends, with growing wages surpassing inflation for the first time in two years. Consumer sentiment has also improved slightly but remains below pre-pandemic baselines, and inflation concerns linger. However, improvements in sentiment typically must be sustained for a period of time before that translates to consumer spending. As a result, home improvement shoppers remain cautious with their spend, especially big-ticket discretionary purchases, and are more focused on smaller repair and maintenance projects.\nThese trends are consistent with our expectations and reinforce our outlook for our relevant market to be down mid-single digits in the second half of the year, with our sales continuing to outpace the market by 100 to 200 basis points. Looking ahead, it's encouraging to consider that home improvement projects are typically postponed rather than canceled. Home improvement spend, as a percentage of home equity, is below the historical average, a positive indicator for medium-term demand as consumer sentiment improves.\nThe aging housing stock will also drive remodel and repairs combined with other favorable trends like millennial household formation, aging in place, and persistent remote work. All of these factors continue to make us bullish on the mid-to-long-term outlook for our industry. In closing, we remain a customer-centric company focused on our daily execution while also ensuring we continue to make the right investments to take share in any macro environment.\nOur total home strategy is resonating with our pro and DIY customers alike, and we are confident in our ability to deliver in the short and long term. As I'm out visiting stores each week, I continue to be impressed by our hardworking frontline associates, and I'd like to thank each of them for their commitment to Lowe's and their communities. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Our Q2 comparable sales were down 1.6%, slightly above expectations. We successfully recovered $300 million of delayed seasonal sales from Q1 due to the late start to spring, $50 million more than anticipated. We saw growth in rough plumbing, building materials, paint, seasonal and outdoor living, lawn and garden, and hardware as we captured these spring sales and continued to see solid, broad-based pro demand.\nThese factors partly offset 160 basis points of lumber deflation, as well as continued pressure on big-ticket DIY discretionary demand that Marvin mentioned earlier. In hard lines, we drove broad-based sales growth driven by our stronger-than-expected spring recovery. Lawn and garden was a standout category achieved in partnership with our live goods vendors, who helped us effectively respond to changing weather patterns and stretch spring into the summer months.\nWe saw an increase in smaller instant gratification projects that improve outdoor spaces at an affordable price, like landscaping projects and pre-potted plants. Seasonal and outdoor living also benefited from the weather recovery, where we saw momentum in outdoor power equipment, specifically in riders with the strength of our exciting products from John Deere and Ariens, along with the battery-powered equipment from the strength of EGO, Kobalt, and Craftsman. We are pleased with our strong seasonal sell-through, putting us in a better inventory position than last year as we move into the second half.\nHardware was another top-performing category this quarter as our associates drove attachments alongside the higher lumber units and leaned into fastening with key brands like Spax, GRK, Power Pro One, and FastenMaster. In tools, we started the rollout of Klein Tools, the number one tool brand for electricians and HVAC professionals. We are excited about the launch of this brand, which is returning to Lowe's after nearly 15 years. As part of this brand, we will offer the largest assortment of Klein Tools anywhere in the home improvement retail channel, featuring hand tools, storage, safety, and electrical products in store and online, positioning us as the go-to retailer for these brand-loyal customers.\nWithin home decor, paint delivered the strongest comp performance this quarter as we gained traction with the pros who paint. These pros are increasingly taking advantage of our MVPs Paint Rewards program, paint job site delivery, and our new SpecRight Paint designed specifically for pros. Turning to appliances, we continue to outperform the market. We've seen a return to pre-pandemic levels of vendor-funded promotions that are pressuring average tickets across the industry.\nBut I'm excited about the traction that we're gaining as the leading appliance retailer in the US, reflected in our unit sales growth, market share gains, and the momentum with our pro customers once again this quarter. One encouraging trend was the increase in bundled appliance purchases. This was fueled by focused Red Vest associate selling, auto-applied supplier rebates, faster fulfillment through our market delivery model, and our improved online customer experience. Now, shifting gears to building products, we continue to see strength in key pro categories, helping offset the pressure from year-over-year lumber deflation.\nWhile lumber deflation pressured our top line by 160 basis points and our pro comps by 315 basis points, the category once again delivered the highest units comp in the company this quarter, reflecting strong pro demand. Our continued growth in building materials and rough plumbing is another positive indicator of the resilience of the small to mid-size pros, supported by the healthy backlogs Marvin mentioned earlier. In rough plumbing, we expanded our assortment of PEX products and added our first battery-powered Kobalt drain auger. This is one of several new Kobalt launches this year as we celebrate this private brand's 25th anniversary.\nOur private brands are specced out and quality-tested to ensure that they are equal to or better quality than comparable national brands, and we continue to see our customers respond to their great quality and value. Our increasing private brand penetration is nicely balanced with a strong lineup of trusted national brands like Bosch, DeWalt, Rubbermaid, and Scotts. Shifting to localization, we completed our rural expansion to roughly 300 stores ahead of schedule this quarter.\nThis includes scaling our store-within-a-store concept with Petco, designed to provide a dedicated space for all things pet. While it's still early, we're encouraged to see an increasing basket size in these stores, and customers are saying that they appreciate the convenience and the ability to reduce the number of stops they need to make. As Marvin mentioned, our work to optimize our rural stores is one piece of our broader localization strategy, designed to drive market share gains, increase productivity, and margins. Another highlight this quarter is the growth we've driven online as we continue to improve the digital shopping experience and increase conversion.\nOur launch of same-day delivery nationwide on lowes.com and our mobile app is resonating well with our customers. We also introduced a new digital Will This Fit capability that helps customers determine if a refrigerator will fit into their space and a refined search experience with better recommendations, filters, and featured categories. Our Halloween and holiday sets are already available online, positioning us nicely for customers who want to get a jumpstart on decorating.\nWe are also encouraged to see better-than-expected performance for our Lowe's One Roof Media Network, which is driving increased traffic to lowes.com and generating results that are exceeding the industry average for our suppliers. Our media network is one of many merchandising PPI initiatives underway at Lowe's. The team is constantly working with our suppliers to find ways to take costs out as commodity prices and transportation costs have come down, and we continue to enhance our technology and processes to optimize pricing. We have also expanded our merchandising services team, or MST, to over 30,000 associates across our stores and garden centers, which frees up our Red Vest associates to spend more time serving customers.\nNew this year, we are adding MST assistant store managers. This role will be focused on providing dedicated store leadership for the critical work that this team does. Through their improved service, the team is squarely centered on driving sales per square foot productivity in our stores while creating a better shopping experience for our customers. As I close, I'd like to once again extend my appreciation to our vendors and merchants for their hard work and partnership. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nAll right. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased to begin by announcing that we are awarding over $100 million in bonuses for our frontline hourly associates in recognition of their hard work and dedication during the Q2. Our investments in our associates are paying off as we continue to elevate the customer experience with a 200 basis point improvement in both our DIY and pro customer service scores this quarter as compared to last year. We are seeing strong staffing levels and improved associate engagement as we continue to invest in associate wages and ongoing development through Lowe's University.\nAs Marvin mentioned, our online comp sales grew 6.9% in the quarter, and roughly half of those orders are picked up in a store. We continue to unlock productivity through one of our many PPI initiatives by reducing the time to pick these orders by approximately 70% as our associates leverage our omnichannel investments, which include mobile devices and order picking carts with mobile printers to streamline the process. We've enhanced our workforce management tools to better align staffing levels with customer demand. These enhancements are allowing our customers to get in, get what they need, and get back to their projects faster.\nLooking ahead, we are further enhancing our BOPUS experience as we transform the front end of our stores. This includes an expanded staging area, a dedicated pickup desk with improved signage, and new technology that expedites the process. Now, shifting to Pro, we continue to deliver positive comps this quarter despite lumber deflation. Under the leadership of our new Executive Vice President, Quonta Vance, we will continue to expand our online business tools for pros that allow them to easily generate quotes and track orders as part of the MVPs Pro Rewards program.\nAs we continue to find ways to save pros time, this month we launched our newest online tool, Purchase Authorization. Until now, when pros sent a crew member to the store to pick up an order, the designated buyer would need to call their team from the checkout line to confirm the order and have it authorized by the store. This could be a time-consuming process, taking the pros' time away from their job site and the associates' time away from serving other customers. Now, runners can simply scan a QR code that's pre-authorized up to a specified amount and check out without having to wait in line at the pro desk.\nThis solution addresses a pain point for many pro customers and our pro desk associates and leapfrogs the competition. We're encouraged to see that our suite of online tools is resonating with pros, and adoption is already exceeding our expectations. Now, I'd like to spend a moment discussing how we are managing shrink, which is a big responsibility for any retailer, especially in this environment. As expected, shrink was in line with last year's results despite industry-wide challenges, driven by our proactive customer service, tech-driven solutions, industry-leading asset protection program, and our penetration of rural stores.\nWe're developing radio frequency identification, or RFID, technology embedded in power tools to prevent theft. This solution will be largely invisible to customers, but it makes a tool inoperable until it is scanned and purchased. Turning to PPI, or Perpetual Productivity Improvement, in store operations, we have a series of exciting initiatives on our roadmap that will continue to deliver productivity for the company. In addition to the omnichannel enhancements that I mentioned earlier, we also upgraded the freight flow process for shipments from our distribution centers into our stores and onto the selling floor.\nThrough improved technology, we now have better visibility into how freight is flowing into our stores. This enables us to better match staffing levels with the type of inbound freight, getting the product onto the shelves faster. These PPI initiatives, combined with our continued investments in our associates, have helped us to control our expenses and improve our customer service scores in a down sales environment. Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our frontline associates in Kentucky, New York, and Vermont who supported flood relief in their communities, and to our teams in Hawaii who are responding to the devastating wildfires.\nTo support the recovery efforts in Maui, we are donating $1 million to provide food, emergency shelter, and relief supplies to those affected, and are grateful for our frontline associates for going above and beyond to help those on the island with recovery and cleanup. With that, I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q2 results. We generated diluted earnings per share of $4.56. Q2 sales were $25 billion. As a reminder, prior year sales included $1.7 billion generated in our Canadian retail business. Results also reflect a $335 million sales headwind due to the shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. As Marvin mentioned, comparable sales were down 1.6%, which includes approximately 160 basis points of lumber deflation. This pressure was partly offset by a 125 basis point benefit, or $300 million of seasonal sales delayed from Q1 due to a late start to spring.\nAlthough the calendar shift pressured total sales growth in Q2, it had no impact on comparable sales, as comps are calculated based on weeks 15 to 27 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was up 0.3% to prior year. Ticket increases in the majority of our merchandise categories were offset by lumber deflation and more normalized appliance promotions. Comp transactions declined 1.9%, driven by continued pressure in DIY discretionary purchases, partly offset by our seasonal recovery. Our monthly comps were down 1.2% in May, 1.6% in June, and 2% in July as the seasonal recovery was concentrated in the first half of the quarter.\nGross margin was 33.7% of sales in the Q2, up 42 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from our ongoing PPI initiatives, favorable product mix, and lower transportation costs. These benefits were somewhat offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network, and as expected, shrink was in line with prior year. SG&A of 16.4% of sales delevered 16 basis points, largely due to lower sales related to the shift in our fiscal calendar.\nPlease note that it also includes the benefit of a one-time legal settlement. We continue to tightly manage expenses, adjusting spend appropriately to align with demand, all while still improving our customer service. Also, as you heard from Marvin, Bill, and Joe, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum we are experiencing across our portfolio of PPI initiatives, which continue to create significant value for the organization and helped offset the impact from lower sales. Operating margin rate of 15.6% of sales levered 18 basis points, consistent with the expectations we outlined on our last call. The effective tax rate was 24.6%, in line with the prior year.\nInventory ended the quarter at $17.4 billion, $1.9 billion lower than the prior year quarter. US inventory units were down 3% compared to last year as we continue to manage replenishment in line with sales trends. Now, let me turn to capital allocation. In Q2, we generated $3.5 billion in free cash flow and returned $2.8 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.1 million shares for $2.2 billion. In addition, we paid $624 million in dividends at $1.05 per share, and we announced a 5% increase to $1.10 per share for the dividend paid on 9 August 2024.\nCapital expenditures totaled $385 million as we continue to focus on high-return projects that support our growth objectives. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Adjusted debt to EBITDA stands at 2.69x as we move towards our stated target of 2.75x, in line with our Triple B Plus credit rating. Additionally, we delivered return on invested capital of 27.8%, inclusive of a 750 basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the discrete gain we reported in Q1. Now, turning to our 2023 financial outlook.\nAs Marvin mentioned, we continue to expect our relevant market to decline mid-single digits this year and to outperform the market by 100 to 200 basis points. As such, this morning, we reaffirmed our full year 2023 financial outlook. We continue to expect 2023 sales in a range of $87 to 89 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 2% to down 4%. This includes a 150 basis point impact from lumber deflation for the full year. This outlook reflects continued strength in pro and online, offset by ongoing pressure from DIY discretionary purchases.\nSpecific to our Q3 expectations, we will be cycling over the toughest comparison of the year as we delivered +3% comparable sales in the US last year. Given these difficult comps, we are expecting Q3 sales towards the lower end of our full year guide. We continue to expect full year adjusted operating margin in a range of 13.4% to 13.6%, with disciplined expense management and ongoing PPI initiatives partly offsetting the impact of lower sales volumes. We are reaffirming our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $13.20 to 13.60 cents. As a reminder, our full year outlook for operating margin and diluted EPS excludes adjustments associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year.\nIn closing, I remain confident that the investments we are making in our total home strategy are positioning us to grow our market share regardless of the macro environment while continuing to deliver meaningful long-term shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We are now ready for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, press * 1 on your telephone keypad. To throw your question, press * 2. In order to allow questions from as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Mr. Horvers, please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning. So my first question is on the top line. What drove the difficult comparisons in Q3 that you're not expecting this year? And then as you think about those bigger ticket DIY discretionary categories, how do you see the rate of change in those businesses? i.e., are we starting to get to a baseline level that we can grow from, or is that spending pattern still deteriorating?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey, Chris, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part now. Let Brandon take the second part. When you look at last year, it's two different years, two different macro environments, two different sets of consumer sentiments, two different sets of expectations for DIY and pro customers. I think the key point is that we feel good about the steps we're taking to grow market share. Regardless of the macro environment, we have a plan to outperform the home improvement market by 100 to 200 basis points, and that's what we're focused on. So I'll let Brandon answer the second part of your question.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Chris, this is Brandon. Let me get into a little detail on Q3 and second half. First, before I do that, let me take care of one quick housekeeping item as it relates to Q2 exit rate. There's some noise that we saw in the comp spreads across Q2 given the calendar shift that we experienced. After adjusting those spreads to compare to last year, Q2 comps are down roughly 1% in July. Also, when we look at July and August, they're traditionally lighter volume weeks until we hit the Labor Day fall seasonal period. So looking ahead at Q3 specifically, we are cycling our toughest comparable of the quarter at +3% last year, and August the toughest across that quarter at +4%.\nAnd then your question on sort of puts and takes, different from Q2, as we get into Q3, we won't see the same level of seasonal benefit going forward. We called out $300 million there that we experienced in Q2. More modest lumber deflationary pressure in Q3, which size that at about 75 basis points, and then continuing to expect pressure in the DIY discretionary spend. And then on the flip side, continued growth and momentum from the pro business as we expect to outpace DIY. So those are just to give you some insights as we look at Q2 and how we transition into Q3.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Makes sense. And then on the gross margin line, I know you had some price cost issues in the first half of this year. As you look ahead, is that behind you? And as you think about how freight's going to start to roll through the inventory, should gross margin performance improve in the back half relative to the first half? Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, sure, Chris. So gross margin bounced back as we expected from Q1. We had easier product margin comparables due to prior year timing. The benefits, as you mentioned, the transportation cost relief is now flowing through margin as expected. We also benefited from product mix, and we continue to see great momentum with our PPI benefits across the merchandising portfolio. Those benefits are offset by continued investment in supply chain and the expansion specifically of market delivery. We called out shrink being neutral, as Joe mentioned, continuing to drive tech solutions to manage some of the industry-wide challenges there.\nOverall, as we look at the full year, we still expect roughly gross margins flat across the year. So puts and takes there, just like Q2, supply chain expansion, continued pressure from some of the pro growth initiatives, and then we expect continued benefits across the back half of the year from private brand penetration and supplier clawbacks, lower transportation costs, and initiatives that we're seeing across the pricing portfolio.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nConsumer Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. We're at the halfway point of the year. I was hoping to take stock or diagnose the macro housing, Marvin, you mentioned that, and then also the consumer. Curious how it's playing out versus your expectation. It feels status quo, but wanted to hear the puts and takes on both sides.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYes, Simeon. Look, I think you summed it up well. For us, when we look at consumer sentiment, I mean, we know that we're seeing a pullback in DIY discretionary spend. And that's really, for us, kind of the overall theme of how we see the second half of the year. I think the good news for us is we remain really bullish on the mid- to long-term view of the home improvement market, and we think it's still very healthy. I mean, I can just give you the traditional data points that really matter, and we think that they're going to matter not only for home improvement in the mid- to long-term, but we think this is one of the best retail sectors to be in.\nYou look at home demand, you have two million fewer homes than what's available for sale, the age of homes. 90% of homeowners have fixed mortgage rates in an environment where rates, as you know, are going up. When we look at all the things that we're doing relative to pro to DIY, we feel really, really comfortable that irrespective of the macro environment for home improvement, that we're going to outperform the marketplace by 100 to 200 basis points. Key examples of why we believe that is when we take a brand like Klein Tools that we have had absent from Lowe's for almost 15 years, and we can bring back the number one brand for electrical and HVAC pros and be the largest home improvement retail outlet for that brand.\nThat gives us a lot of confidence that our strategy is working and we're going to continue to grow market share across pro and DIY. But the DIY discretionary pullback on big ticket drives our overall modest concerns about the back half. But even with that, we think we can outperform about 100 to 200 basis points.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nConsumer Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's helpful. The second question is more on margin, and this is maybe irrespective of what happens to sales. So both on SG&A per foot and even GM, you have the PPI as a good guy, and then just in general, spending levels. Can you talk about where PPI is? Is it performing better than you thought? And then is there any areas where you, in hindsight, should be spending more in or less for that matter, just as we think about the margin progression going forward?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo look, I'll take the first part, and I'll let Brandon add any additional context. What's interesting is that PPI started in store operations. I mean, typically, you think about expense, it always begins in the store because of the amount of payroll we spend, how we execute in our 1,700-plus store environment. But then the philosophy started to permeate around the entire company: merchandising, supply chain, and across all those functional areas.\nAnd so because of that, we built a roadmap that Brandon and I could look at over a multi-year timeframe, and we can understand the tech investments we're making and the expense reduction and the productivity that will be driven based on those investments. In addition to that, I don't want to understate the importance of our rural and remote stores.\nAs I mentioned in my prepared comments and Bill mentioned in his, we simply believe as we continue to identify ways to localize the assortment, in addition to putting in technology and implementing PPI, we think it's going to give us a disproportionate benefit over the long term in driving operating margin improvement. And again, PPI is a big part of that. Brandon?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, sure. Simeon, the good news too, when we look more in the short term around the back half of 2023, we actually are expecting PPI to get more momentum in the second half than what we saw in the first half. A couple of really good efforts that are going on with new store tech architecture as we continue to build the modern foundation, enabling new capabilities in the store like omnichannel selling.\nWe're transforming the front end of the stores with improved self-checkout, revamped BOPUS experience, and then across the other areas within merchandising. I mentioned earlier pricing, private brand expansion, and clawback. Then also within the supply chain efforts as we continue to improve process and implement automation there. So all in, really pleased with the progress. We have those benefits factored in. They're going to continue to accelerate as we move across the second half of the year, and those are captured in our expectations.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nConsumer Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nElizabeth Suzuki\n\nEquity Research Management, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just a couple of questions about the assumptions of the guidance. So for the second half, you're assuming at the high end, comps down about 1%, but on the low end, down about 5%. So I'm just curious what economic scenarios you're contemplating for both the high end and the low end. And then if trends you're seeing today continue, do you think you would end up on the higher end or on the lower end?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, well, this is Brandon. I think as we think about our range for the full year, we believe the range is practical, and it reflects a measured approach given the various potential scenarios and outcomes. As we look at the back half, still significant macro uncertainty, inflation, interest rates, and a more cautious consumer, especially on the discretionary side. There's also variables such as the student loans and the uncertainty there with the moratorium. So the team continues to be focused on executing the total home strategy.\nWe believe home improvement's going to be down mid-single digits and will outpace that 100 to 200 basis points. We expect second half, the softness with DIY discretionary to continue, and we expect to continue to see momentum from pro and dot-com. So that's what's reflected overall in our second half.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo Liz, this is Marvin, and this is a point I want to continue to reinforce. I mean, obviously, we're looking at the data that we have available, and we're looking at historical trends and how that data correlates to historical trends. But what we're saying is we're going to outperform the market by 100 to 200 basis points. So if we're being too pessimistic on the second half, that's great because we're going to outperform that by 100 to 200 basis points.\nAnd so for us, we're really focused on controlling what we control, executing our total home strategy, and just maintaining our organizational alignment and agility around whatever the macro throws our way. But we're just really confident as a team and a company that we have the agility to make sure that we continue to take market share irrespective of what the home improvement environment will be in the second half of the year.\n\nElizabeth Suzuki\n\nEquity Research Management, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. So your average ticket flipped back slightly positive. We know lumber played a role, but considering this line is still 30% above 2019, can you talk us through the moving parts here in a little more detail? And if you think it's fair to say that the average ticket has normalized or if there's still risk that you revert back closer to those '19 levels?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nZach, this is Brandon. Let me take sort of the ticket transaction narrative here. So on the ticket side, as we look at inflation, the benefits we expect to continue to normalize as we cycle a number of the price increases from 2022. As we look at new cost increases that are currently in our pipeline or inbound from our suppliers, that's effectively minimal at this point. There is some positive improvement in the average ticket and the expansion there that's not necessarily inflation-driven as we continue to see healthy growth from our pro customers and pro penetration. But punchline, as we look across the second half, we're not anticipating meaningful deflationary pressure.\nWe're going to see year-over-year lumber pricing is going to be much more normal across the second half. Bill mentioned we're going to begin to cycle more normal appliance pricing, specifically as we get into Q4. Then the ongoing expectation with DIY discretionary is going to continue to put some pressure on tickets. Taking all that into account, our outlook assumes more pressure overall on transactions, and we look at ticket and expect that to really hold over the back half of the year.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. And just over the past two years, your cost controls and operating margins have been able to show really nice progress even on a negative comp. And considering all the PPI commentary and host of structural changes, can you talk through what kind of margin progression we should anticipate as comps flip back to positive eventually? And if you think the expansion today could in any way preclude more meaningful expansion and recovery?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Zach, this is Brandon. I think, look, right now, we're really focused on delivering our expectations for 2023. We've laid that out in the guidance. I'll reference back just as your question around flipping positive comp. We laid out various scenarios back in December. We still, as we sit here today, confident in our path to continue to expand comps top line through deployment of our total home strategy. We feel like we have a nice path going forward to expand operating margins.\nWe've talked already at length around where we are from a perpetual productivity initiative standpoint. We're going to continue to make progress there and confident again that we have the roadmap in front of us and all those building blocks are in place when we look beyond 2023.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thanks for the time.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning, guys. Can you please talk about any regional differences you're seeing both in different parts of the country, but also differentiation here between, let's call it, the rural locations you guys continue to reference as well as heavier urban locations? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. So Scot, I'll take the first part of that. Look, I say the regional differences; there's nothing material to speak to. I mean, we know that housing and home prices ramped up pretty aggressively during the pandemic timeframe in a couple of markets. But when we look at the overall geographic spread, I mean, there are no real material differences between locales that had dramatically increased in housing costs, and some of those costs are starting to moderate because you still have markets around the country, rather, where home prices are still going up. So we look at it, obviously, because it's one of those key internal macro indicators that we factor into our assessments, but there's nothing material to speak to.\nRelative to urban and rural, we spent a lot of time talking about the importance of localization. To say that Lowe's was a company that was not very localized five years ago would be an understatement. As much progress as we have made, I think Bill will tell you that we still are excited because there's still lots of opportunity for us to be even more specific in how we localize from a rural and from an urban standpoint. I'm going to let Bill talk a little bit about our rural initiative and kind of what we're seeing. It's early days, but the early signs are positive. I'll let him share just some general thoughts around those initiatives and kind of what we hope we'll continue to see.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Thanks, Marvin. And Scot, as I said in my prepared remarks, we got roughly 300 stores completed in Q2. Excited about what we're hearing from our consumers is they're giving us credit for the products that we're putting in there. We've been able to do some stuff around pet with our partnership with Petco, which we're excited about. We've also continued to learn and continue to listen to our customers. And so there's opportunities with different things related to that rural customer, whether that's utility vehicles, livestock feed, apparel, different types of products that they'll use every single day in and around their home.\nAnd so we're going to continue to learn. We're going to continue to adjust as we go, as Marvin said, kind of in the early innings of our localization opportunities. And on the urban side, we continue to adjust there as well, making sure that we're right for those urban markets, whether that's the types of products that they need for security and safety, whether that's areas in and around building codes, and making sure that we can meet the pros' needs in those markets. We're going to continue to tweak and adjust as we go forward. So excited about what we're doing on the localization front and what we're doing with rural.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nSo, just a clarification, if I can. On the rural side, is it outperforming the urban areas now, or that's the expectation as you wind up localizing more?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nIt's performing at what we expected it to perform.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's not the fairest metric, and there's a lot of noise in it. But if we simply look at Lowe's performance relative to its largest competitor, over the last couple of quarters, Lowe's has been outcomping that player. Presumably, this quarter, it's in part due to Pro doing a little bit better, online sales doing well, and maybe more seasonal catch-up as a result of leaning harder into that category. So A, is that the right interpretation? And then B, how sustainable do you think that this measure of Lowe's performance is?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's",
    "content2": "So, Michael, I'll take that. This is Marvin. And I'll just be really honest with you. We spend a lot of time talking about the importance of being customer-centric. We don't pay a ton of attention to what's happening at our competitor because we believe if we take care of the customer, the customer takes care of everything else. So we're going to continue to stay focused on our total home strategy. We think if we do that well, then our results will be sustainable. And that means that we're going to be very localized.\nIt means that we're going to be intentional around the small to medium-sized pro, that we're going to make our 1,700 stores connected to our customers via omnichannel, and we're going to continue to be intentional around what we do to give our associates a great place to work. Those things are most important. And I think our results this quarter, although in a difficult market reflecting our total home strategy, is working.\nAnd we're continuing to invest the appropriate amount of capital to ensure that, irrespective of the macro environment, we're not going to slow down on our investments in supply chain, IT infrastructure, omnichannel, and our pro initiative. So for us, it's all about taking care of the customer. And if that allows us to outperform our closest competitor, then that's just a benefit that we'll be more than willing to accept.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nUnderstood. My follow-up question is on your view of the sales environment for the back half, understanding that you're still taking a prudently cautious stance given what's happening with macroeconomic indicators. Now, with that being said, are you seeing any signs that those discretionary big-ticket purchases that had been weak, such as patio furniture, grills, other big-ticket purchases, are starting to stabilize, or do you have a line of sight that they might start to stabilize as you move into next year?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Michael, this is Brandon. Just a reminder again, as we look out at the second half, we're cycling up plus 3% in Q3 of last year and a positive 0.7% Q4. So that's been factored into our expectations. To your question specifically on DIY discretionary, we definitely saw the smaller ticket discretionary projects that were fueled by lawn and garden. We saw that benefit in Q2. As we get into second half, that seasonal benefit's going to subside. So some of the bigger, I'll call it interior DIY discretionary areas, I would say we're seeing very much performance here early on through August, similar performance with what we've seen over the first half. And that baseline performance is essentially what's reflected in our expectations for second half.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nEric Bosshard\n\nCEO and Consumer Analyst, Cleveland Research\n\nThanks. Two things, if I could. First of all, I guess probably for Bill, as you think about managing inventory, mix, and promotions in this environment, how are you trying to position the business? Are you leaning in to try to drive traffic? Are you responding perhaps a little bit more defensively? Just how are you trying to position inventory, mix, and promotions?\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. Eric, good. First of all, thanks for the question. We're focused on trying to provide value to the customer every single day. And so that comes through lots of different things, making sure that from the pro side that we continue to do things like we're doing right now as we roll out Klein Tools in our stores. Excited about that launch. We think that offers a nice opportunity for us as we'll have the largest assortment of Klein in the home improvement channel. So right now, we've got roughly 150 SKUs in the stores today. We'll have all of our stores set by the end of this week. So that's just one way of being able to provide value to that pro customer.\nAnd then from an inventory side, we came out of Q2 in better position with our seasonal inventories than we did a year ago. So that helps us. It allows us to invest as we go into Labor Day and fall planning, fall harvest, Halloween, holiday, those types of things so that we can continue to provide value that way to the consumer. Those holiday sets and Halloween sets provide a transition in the stores, you know, and it gives the customer some excitement. And then we've got a lot of new stuff that we've talked about.\nWe've got Coca-Cola that'll finish rolling out in our stores, being able to have access to that entire portfolio of product we're excited about. We'll roll out Carhartt to 250 stores in Q3. So we're excited about getting that out there for both the DIY and the pro. And then we'll have some new stuff in that spooky area for Halloween for the Halloween enthusiasts. So all of that.\nTry to provide value to our customers in lots of different ways. Then offer them those promotional offers and appliances, like you have to provide, because over 100,000 appliances break every single day. We want to make sure that we're relevant out there and try to manage all of it in a portfolio approach. We've got a lot of stuff going. We're excited about it. We think it will give us a nice way to position ourselves to drive value for our customers through the back half of the year and into next year.\n\nEric Bosshard\n\nCEO and Consumer Analyst, Cleveland Research\n\nOkay. And then, second question, if I could, as you, Brandon, did a good job of explaining that you've kind of cycled through the price increases and there's minimal from here. The math of the past couple of years has been price up more than volume's been down. I'm just curious how you all think about, as price no longer goes up, the path for volume turning from a negative to a positive. I'm just curious how you think about that and what makes that happen and perhaps when.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Eric, this is Brandon. I think, again, focus right now on 2023, as I mentioned earlier, we're kind of breaking down transactions and ticket. We do expect pressure on transactions as we move across the balance of the year. Ticket to hold. I do think when we get on the backside of this, I'm not going to put a time frame on it, obviously, as there's a bunch of variables, a lot of uncertainty. It's too early for us to call what 2024 is going to look like. But I do think we are expecting a convergence and a better balance of transactions and ticket, probably similar to pre-COVID levels as we start to look ahead across the long term.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThis is Marvin. The only thing I'll add to that is we still are in the early innings of making what I would call best-in-class business operations in our omnichannel area, in localization, and in just the overall technology infrastructure. I've mentioned that we're retiring a 30-year-old operating system. Not only will that make our stores a lot easier to operate from a technology standpoint, but what it does, it gives us incredible agility to build on top of that modern platform for more omnichannel capability. There's still a lot of things we're doing today the hard way.\nSo I get excited because I can get out of bed every day, and I can see a long list of initiatives that we have yet to get to that's going to drive operating margin improvement, drive space productivity, and hopefully will drive top line as consumer sentiment continues to improve. So we're confident that we've not even reached a point of peak performance relative to the investment cycle that we have because we've been other places, we know what world-class looks like, and we know that we're on a journey to get there.\nBut there are still areas of our business, Pro, online, fulfillment capabilities, space productivity, that we know that we're still in the early innings. And so that's exciting. We just have to do the work to make sure that we can achieve the expectations we have. And Rob, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Final question will be from Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst and Equity Research, Citi\n\nGood morning. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I wanted to circle back to your commentary about the appliance promotions. Could you elaborate on that a bit more? It sounds new. What are your expectations for that side of the business in the second half of the year? And then just to follow up on the promotions question earlier, it seems like the industry has not needed to be promotional. How long do you think this can last if big-ticket discretionary weakness continues?\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. So Steve, this is Bill. So just on the appliance side specifically, what we've seen with appliances is that really the industry has returned to kind of a more normalized go-to-market promotional offering similar to what you saw prior to the pandemic. And so this normalization, as I said in my remarks, has put pressure on average ticket and average selling price across the industry. Everybody, I think, is feeling that impact. But essentially, we cycle this as we get into Q4, and we get into more of an apples-to-apples comparison when we get to Q4. But we're excited about the strength that we've seen with our appliance business.\nFirst-quarter track line data would indicate that we took share in the Q1. So we're driving units and trying to make sure that we can meet the needs of our consumers. As, like, I said in Eric's question, 100,000 appliances break every single day. We got to be there for our consumer. But it's not a radical shift to heavy promotions. It's more of a normalized promotion.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst and Equity Research, Citi\n\nGot it. Then just a question on the back half margins for you, Brandon. Given the commentary about same-store sales in the Q3, is there anything to be mindful of in terms of gross margin or SG&A cadence in the Q3 versus the Q4?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nNo, I would say, Steven, still expect 40 to 60 basis points of expansion. The one thing that I would call out, I mentioned we expect the PPI benefits to build over the second half. And then the second thing I'll mention is we are cycling over $400 million of associate discretionary bonuses that were paid out last year that we're not expecting to recur. So those are the big items that I would call out as we move through the second half.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSteve, I'd be remiss if I didn't just talk a little bit about our performance and shrink in the most difficult retail environment for shrink in my 35 years in this space. I want to let Joe just talk a little bit about the successes that we're seeing and how we hope that continues to support our growth margin forecast for the back half of the year.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin. And let me give you just a quick shout-out to the store operations team and really our asset protection team. I believe they're best-in-class. And as you look across the actions that we've taken, whether it's in supply chain, whether it's on the front end with our new proprietary self-checkouts, replacing the MCRs, we have a best-in-class awareness platform that's got a 92% voluntary participation rate. And we have a line of sight for front-end transformations as we move into next year, the 100% execution of our high-shrink program where we've identified the stores. And so I feel really confident and just a great job by the team.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our Q3 Earnings Call in November.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the Lowe's Q2 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect."

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties, and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A, and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly Earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone. In the Q1, our comparable sales declined 4.3%, driven by approximately 350 basis points of lumber deflation, unfavorable weather, and lower DIY discretionary sales. We continue to build momentum with the Pro through our MVP's Pro Rewards program and our expanded assortment of pro national brands. Lumber deflation disproportionately impacted pro sales by approximately 800 basis points of comp pressure, and despite this pressure, comparable pro sales were slightly positive in Q1 with broad based strength across multiple categories. This positive comp in pro builds on top of a 22% US pro comp in the Q1 of last year. DIY sales were pressured by delayed spring and lower than expected discretionary demand.\nAlthough we are encouraged to see better trends in periods of favorable weather, a late start to spring disproportionately impacts the do-it-yourself customers who represent 75% of our business. Given many seasonal categories are heavily concentrated in DIY. As weather improves, we're optimistic that customers will re-engage with spring projects, and we are ready to support the increased demand with our best-in-stock position and staffing levels in three years, coupled with improved omnichannel and fulfillment capabilities. However, we are expecting a pullback in discretionary consumer spending over the near term. Given these trends, we're updating our full-year outlook this morning. Despite market pressures, we are pleased to see market share gains this quarter, and we expect to continue to outpace the market as we execute against the growth initiatives of our Total Home strategy.\nWe're also confident in our ability to drive continued productivity through our Perpetual Productivity Improvement Initiatives, or PPI. This operational discipline and agility helped us to offset the impact of lower sales and higher wage costs in Q1, adjusted operating margin expanded 47 basis points in the Q1, leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.67, a 5% increase compared to last year. While we can't control commodity deflation, weather, or macroeconomic uncertainty, we can control how effectively we operate our business and adapt to a changing environment. A key component of our transformation that is often overlooked is the culture of continuous improvement we've introduced at Lowe's, which is the foundation of our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives.\nAnd although our PPI initiatives originated in SO operations, we're now focused on driving productivity across all areas of the company, and we see tremendous runway ahead for continued productivity across the business, including dozens of PPI work streams in merchandising, store operations, supply chain, and corporate support functions. As an example, we're replacing our 30-year-old operating system with a modern omnichannel architecture that will enable a seamless, intuitive customer experience while removing complexity for associates. This project has been underway for four years, and we are pleased that we are on track to retire all legacy green screens by the end of this year. This new modern operating system will allow us to unlock a significant amount of labor productivity and deploy new capabilities, including enabling more seamless omnichannel selling from within our stores.\nIn addition to our new operating system, our penetration of rural stores gives us an opportunity to drive sustainable profit growth due to the much lower expense base that's required to operate these stores. As an example, what we spend to operate our store in Philadelphia, Mississippi is significantly less than the cost to operate one of our stores in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in years past our penetration of rural and remote stores was viewed as a competitive disadvantage, we now expect that these stores will be a key component of our operating profit growth over the next three to five years.\nGiven our confidence in this trajectory, we set long term targets of $1.5 to 2 billion in incremental productivity gains at our December analyst and investor conference, and we are tracking our progress against those initiatives on a monthly, if not a weekly basis.\nIn addition to our disciplined focus on productivity this quarter, we also continue to make strides with our Total Home strategy and in Pro, our growth was fueled by continued acceleration of our MVP's Pro Rewards program and CRM tool coupled with our improved Pro assortment, inventory depth, and omnichannel capabilities. These initiatives have enabled us to continue to gain traction with our core Pro customer which is a small to medium-sized Pro. Joe will discuss some of the exciting new Pro initiatives later in the call.\nOnline sales also accelerated this quarter with 6% comparable sales growth representing more than a 10% sales penetration. Online growth was supported by an increase in Pro sales as we continue to upgrade our Pro digital experience with new tools and personalization. We also continue to enhance our DIY online experience by making home improvement projects easier for consumers to visualize, estimate, and shop. These investments are paying off with higher online conversions and attachment rates.\nIn supply chain, we continue to roll out our market delivery model, bringing us to 12 geographic regions across the country, supporting more than 1,100 stores. We're pleased that this more efficient model of delivering big and bulky products is already enabling us to accelerate our market share gains in appliances, and will enable future growth in other big and bulky product categories. We remain on schedule to have market delivery rolled out by the end of 2023.\nDespite a macroeconomic environment with mixed signals creating near-term pressures, we remain optimistic about the future of home improvement. Once we navigate through this uncertainty, we remain bullish on the long-term outlook for our industry due to the unique convergence of structural drivers and demographic trends that are supportive of home improvement demand. We feel fortunate to operate in such a favorable sector of retail where 2/3 of our sales remain non-discretionary. As we navigate this near-term pressure, we will continue to monitor trends closely, and we are confident that we have the agility needed to quickly adapt to any scenario. In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their continued hard work and dedication to supporting our customers and our communities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. During the Q1, five of our 14 merchandising categories were positive: building materials, rough plumbing, paint, hardware, and appliances. We continue to see broad-based Pro strength across all three merchandising divisions, including home decor. Paint and appliances delivered the strongest comps this quarter. Our momentum in appliances continues to build as we drove higher unit sales and work to continue to take market share by leveraging our improved omnichannel shopping experience, enhanced market delivery capabilities, and expanded assortment. Appliances are a great example of an omnichannel category where customers often compare options online, then visit our showroom to see products in person, and then get their questions answered by one of our appliance specialists.\nWith our improved online capabilities like easy scheduling and order tracking, we continue to see more and more of our customers getting comfortable completing their purchases online.\nIn the US we estimate that roughly 100,000 appliances break every day, so our investments in fast appliance delivery and a seamless omnichannel shopping experience positions us well as the go-to destination for these urgent and often non-discretionary needs. We are also seeing increased demand in paint, especially from our pros who paint as they take advantage of our paint jobsite delivery, our MVP's paint rewards program, and our improved product assortment. This quarter we took the next step in catering to these important customers by launching Spec Right Interior Paint in partnership with Sherwin-Williams. This is our first exclusive line of tintable paint formulated specifically for Pros\nWithin decor, we recently launched new closet organization solutions across four private brands to meet a range of storage needs and budgets. This includes modular, easy-to-install wood or wire closet systems that are modern, customizable, and a far better value than the competition. Our private brand strategy allows us to deliver value to DIY customers who are looking for high-quality, on-trend products at more affordable price points, which enables us to provide differentiation, loyalty, and profitability.\nTurning to Building Products. Building materials and rough plumbing led the way. In building materials, we saw broad-based strength reflecting the investments we made to improve our Pro offering through an enhanced assortment. You may remember last year when we announced a new 10-foot fiberglass rebar known as PINKBAR by Owens Corning. This product exceeded our sales expectation, and, given its strength, lightweight materials, and corrosion resistance. This year we're building on that success with the new 20-foot PINKBAR product designed to help Pros reinforce bigger structures using fewer connections, ultimately saving them time and money on material costs.\nRough plumbing was driven by strength in water heaters, HVAC, plumbing repair, and pipe and fittings. As we continue to strengthen our offering for the Pro and the DIY consumer in these categories, and while lumber comps were pressured by steep year-over-year lumber deflation, the category had the highest unit comp in the company this quarter, reflecting strong Pro demand. We are pleased with our continued enhancements to our strong assortment of Pro products from trusted brands like Bosch, DeWalt, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, Flex, GRK, Hubbell, ITW, Klein Tools, Lesco, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder, and Werner in hardlines. Our performance was pressured by the delayed spring, some volatile weather in the west, and softer discretionary spending. However, we did see higher demand during periods where weather improved in lawn and garden.\nWe proactively partnered with our live goods vendors to increase our agility in responding to changing weather patterns, which was critical in a season marked by erratic weather. Our live goods vendors play a key role each spring as we continue to refine our local offerings in addition to the timing of when product arrives to our stores. This year they helped support our new Green Vest program where our Merchandising Service Team, or MST Associates, along with support from our vendors now provide service to our garden centers, taking the task off the shoulders of our red vest associates to allow them to focus on serving the customer.\nWe also continue to expand our private brand offering, including a full lineup of new and innovative lawn fertilizers and grass seed products through our Sta-Green brand, which is already exceeding our expectations. In hardware, in addition to delivering a positive comp, we also saw strong attachment rates alongside the higher lumber unit sales and strength in building materials powered by the improved assortments of the key fastening brands like SPAX, GRK, FastenMaster, ITW, and PowerPro.\nThis is a key pillar of our total home strategy with the goal of expanding market share, increasing inventory productivity, and protecting our margins. We have been piloting a localized framework for a few common market categories like rural and urban stores. Today I'm excited to announce we are now scaling our rural framework to as many as 300 additional stores by year-end with a wider offering of farm, ranch, and outdoor products that positions Lowe's as a one-stop shop to make it convenient for rural customers to get what they need in one shopping trip. Our rural format includes broader product offerings in categories such as pet,livestock, trailers, fencing, utility vehicles, specialized hardware, and our new Carhartt apparel, all designed to meet the unique needs and preferences of rural homeowners who work and play outdoors. Given our rural store footprint and long-standing relationships in these communities.\nWe see this as a natural opportunity for our business and one that will simplify the shopping experience for these very valuable customers. And as Marvin mentioned, we see the productivity improvements in these stores as a key component to delivering sustainable growth in our operating profit. We also remain focused on our many merchandising PPI initiatives, including leveraging our modernized cost optimization tools to negotiate costs with vendors. And we're getting more strategic and surgical in our inventory planning to focus on more high velocity core inventory items with low markdown risk like Pro replenishment and fewer slow velocity SKUs. From a technology standpoint, in the Q1 we completed the rollout of new dedicated Zebra smartphones for all MST associates ahead of schedule. These devices are equipped with the new MST App designed to optimize their time with technology that leapfrogs the competition.\nThe system automatically prioritized planogram changes, pricing updates, base service, and other projects to optimize associates' time on the most efficient, highest value next task. It also gives associates step-by-step instructions to maximize productivity and minimize the learning curve for new associates. This app was built internally to seamlessly integrate with our other mobile apps. For example, each time an MST associate resets a bay, the product location automatically updates in our associate product app and our customer mobile app so both associates and customers can quickly find what they're looking for. As I close, I'd like to again extend my appreciation to our vendors and our merchants for their partnership, hard work, innovation, and continued support. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's\n\nThank you Bill and good morning everyone. At Lowe's, we are committed to being the employer of choice in retail where associates choose to build their careers. As a reflection of this commitment, over the last three years we have increased the hourly rate for our store associates by 20%. And since 2018, we have invested over $3 billion in incremental wage and share based compensation for our frontline associates. As a result of our consistent and ongoing commitment to our hourly associates, we are seeing our best staffing levels in three years, improved retention, and the highest customer satisfaction scores in our company's history. In addition to compensation, we are also taking other steps to show appreciation to our associates, including simple initiatives like lowering the prices of the food in our store break rooms, and closing our stores on Easter for the fourth consecutive year.\nThese expressions of appreciation may not sound overly complex, but to our hourly associates, they matter. As a former hourly associate, one way I measure improved associate engagement is by tracking the number of people who transition their jobs and into careers. More than 85% of leadership roles are now filled from within, up nearly 700 basis points over the last two years. Our frontline associates deserve all the credit for the transformation of our company, and I would like to personally thank all of our associates for everything they do to support each other, our customers, and our communities. Now let me transition to Pro. One of the highlights in the Q1. I'm excited to announce that we just launched new Pro Online Business Tools, the latest enhancement to our MVP's Pro Rewards program, which is designed to make pros of all sizes feel like MVPs at Lowe's.\nThrough our surveys, we learned pros would welcome time saving tools that help them shop quickly and minimize time away from the job site. At the same time, we learned our Pro Associates spend a lot of time building quotes and checking order status, tasks that take them away from serving customers in their stores. To solve for both needs, we launched a suite of tools on Lowe's.com and Our mobile app that makes it easy for pros to manage their orders from anywhere, whether that's on the job site, at home or out of town, rather than having to drive to our stores to get a quote.\nPros can now build and update online quotes in minutes. It automatically applies their volume savings, pricing, and discounts and lets them quickly download a PDF quote for their customers. They can also use order tracking to track the status of the order throughout the fulfillment process. Pros tell us they love how easy and simple these tools are. In one pro's words, he appreciates the convenience of being able to get a price, get it ordered, and get it done. While these tools just launched in April, we are already seeing better than expected adoption rate and sales growth and expect results to accelerate as more pros discover the new features.\nOur traction with Pros online is just one example of the momentum we are seeing in our MVP's Pro Rewards program and one of the reasons we delivered a positive sales comp in Pro for Q1. Pros enrolled in our loyalty program continue to shop more frequently, buy more per trip, and spend more overall. As our CRM tool matures, we are using data insights to identify trends that can improve our marketing and sales strategy, including tailoring our offerings by trade and by tier. These improved pro capabilities and offerings are reflected in our Pro customer satisfaction scores, which are up 200 basis points over last year.\nIn our April survey, over 75% of Pros continued to say their backlogs are healthy. While the Pro backlogs remain consistent with recent quarters, pros did report a shift to smaller project sizes. Moving on to productivity, we continue to scale a series of perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. First, we remain laser-focused on technology modernization across all areas of our stores, including rapidly replacing legacy self-checkout systems with our proprietary self-checkout registers. We are encouraged to see higher customer adoption, throughput, labor productivity, and customer satisfaction on these registers and will complete all remaining stores later this year. We've also matured our new Store Inventory Management System, or SIMS, which continues to improve our inventory visibility and operational efficiency. It also fully integrates with the mobile apps Bill just mentioned, reducing the time both associates and customers spend searching for product.\nWe also continue to enhance our pickup in store experience through streamlined processes and enhanced technology. These improvements drove faster fulfillment and a 400 basis point increase in pickup in store customer satisfaction scores in the Q1. As we approach Memorial Day, I'd like to thank any veterans listening in for their service. As a Marine who served combat tours in the Gulf War and Desert Storm, I am proud of Lowe's longstanding history of giving back to our military community, including a 10% military discount, and we are proud to support these customers who have given so much to our country. As I close, I would like to thank all our store leaders and associates once again for their hard work to serve customers, drive results, and improve this business each and every day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Joe. Beginning with our Q1 results, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.77 compared to $3.51 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. Non-GAAP measures have been adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business in the quarter. We recognized a net pre-tax gain of $63 million on deferred consideration associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.67, an increase of 5% compared to prior year.\nQ1 sales were $22.3 billion, which includes approximately $735 million related to a shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. Also, as a reminder, prior year sales included $1.2 billion generated in our Canadian retail business. As Marvin mentioned, comparable sales were down 4.3%, partly driven by a later start to spring and a more cautious consumer. This also includes approximately 350 basis points of lumber deflation. Please note that comparable sales are calculated based on weeks two through 14 in fiscal 2022.\nComparable average ticket was down 0.3%, largely driven by lumber deflation. As ticket increased in the majority of our other merchandise divisions, comp transactions declined 4% due to the delayed start of spring and lower than expected DIY discretionary sales. Our monthly comps were down 3% in February with unfavorable weather patterns across the country. In March and April, comps declined 5.4% and 3.9% respectively. Lower sales and seasonal categories pressured sales by approximately $400 million in the quarter or approximately 175 basis points.\nGross margin was 33.7% of sales in Q1, down 35 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network. There was no meaningful impact from shrink or credit revenue in the quarter. Also keep in mind that product margin in the prior-year quarter reflected a timing benefit driven by product cost inflation.\nAdjusted SG&A of 17.4% of sales leveraged 79 basis points. As Marvin mentioned, this performance reflects an enterprise-wide disciplined focus on PPI that helped offset pressure from lower sales and wage investments. It also includes the benefit of a one-time legal settlement. Adjusted operating margin rate of 14.4% of sales levered 47 basis points. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.5 billion, down $0.7 billion compared to Q1 of last year. As a reminder, prior year inventory levels includes our Canadian retail business. US inventory units finished the quarter slightly down to last year.\nNow turning to our 2023 financial outlook. Given the higher than expected pullback we've seen in home improvement spending, we are now expecting our relevant market, which reflects our 75% DIY, 25% Pro mix, to be down mid single digits this year. But while we are seeing lower than expected DIY discretionary demand, we are also driving better than expected results in Pro and continued strength in our online sales and core categories like appliances and paint. This reinforces our confidence that we will continue to take market share and outperform the broader market. We are now expecting 2023 sales of $87 to 89 billion with comparable sales expected to range from down 2% to down 4%.\nPlease note that the updated outlook also reflects the impact of lower than expected lumber prices. This creates an incremental 50 basis points of pressure on full year sales as compared to our original expectations. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY for the year as Pro backlogs are healthy and demand for Pro services remains strong.\nWe now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.6% for the full year, driven by PPI initiatives across the company, partly offset by planned wage investments and lower sales volumes. We expect capital expenditures of up to 2 billion this year and with our planned share repurchases, we expect to reach our 2.75x leverage target by the end of the year while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating. Finally, we are also updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in a range of $13.20 to 13.60.Keep in mind that our outlook for operating margin and diluted earnings per share are now adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business that we recorded in Q1.\nTo assist you with your modeling, I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for the Q2. We are expecting an approximately $400 million headwind to sales due to the timing shift in our fiscal calendar. We also expect lumber deflation to pressure Q2 sales by approximately 150 basis points. Finally, we expect $250 million benefit to sales from the delayed spring. Taking all of this into account, we are expecting Q2 sales towards the higher end of our full year guide. We are also expecting adjusted operating margin slightly above prior year results partly due to the impact of the shift in our fiscal calendar year as well as the timing of several productivity initiatives that are already in flight.\nTurning to our capital allocation strategy, during the quarter the company generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased 10.6 million shares for $2.1 billion and paid $633 million in dividends at $1.05 per share, returning $2.8 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $380 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We ended Q1 with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents which includes proceeds from our $3 billion notes offering in March. We ended Q1 at 2.62 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 28% inclusive of a 725 basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the discrete gain in Q1.\nIn closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our total home strategy while navigating near-term market uncertainty, and we remain committed to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy centered around delivering sustainable shareholder value. With that, we will open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We are now ready for questions. If you would like to ask a question, press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press Star 2. In order to allow questions for as many individuals as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question is from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nLiz Suziki\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. So I think previously we had heard a lot of focus on higher sales per square foot as the main driver of operating margin improvement. Now I think you guys are talking more about the benefits of operating in lower cost markets like the more rural stores. So presumably those stores have lower sales per square foot than your stores in more densely populated markets. So how are you thinking about geographic mix and potential for store expansion going forward if those more rural areas are now looking more attractive?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nThis is Marvin. I think it's more in tune with what Bill talked about with some of the investments we're making in those rural stores. As we survey those customers, they give us a list of things they wish they could purchase in one shopping occasion. Some of those types of things, like Carhartt apparel, farm and ranch types of items, and categories, is part of our expansion opportunity. We think by doing those types of initiatives, we're going to see sales per square foot actually improve. As a matter of fact, when we look at the pilot stores where we've been very diligent on going after those specific categories, we actually saw that within the pilot locations. That is leading us into this roughly 300-store expansion of these extended categories. We just see this as a unique opportunity.\nYou know, I mentioned that the expense base is lower, but as you said, if you can have a lower expense base, then you can improve sales per square footage. That, in a combination of all the other initiatives we're doing around the company, we think will continue to drive our profit growth. I'll let Brandon add any additional comments.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, good morning Liz, this is Brandon. Just as we think about the CapEx, as Marvin mentioned, we're not necessarily looking at opening stores over the long term is really part of our core strategy. But we love what we're seeing with these rural stores we initially piloted in a smaller subset of locations. We love the profit profile of these stores within these rural markets, and we've been very thoughtful around the assortments and where we're rolling out. I'm really excited to see this scale as we move through 2023 and what this can deliver from a top line perspective Beyond that.\n\nLiz Suziki\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. And in those stores, just as a follow up, are you seeing online penetration that's similar to your overall company average or is it a little bit lower? Is it higher? Just curious if there's any difference in the online mix.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nLiz,It's about the same, but I mentioned in my prepared comments that we're retiring this old legacy operating system. By retiring this system, it opens up the ability to have really true omnichannel selling in the stores. We see omnichannel and e-commerce growth only accelerating with the ability of our 300-plus thousand associates having the ability to more easily transact in the store, thus connecting physical and digital in a more seamless way.\n\nLiz Suziki\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Mr. Horvers. Your line is open for a question, Mr. Horvers. Perhaps you're muted.Okay everyone, going to move on to our next question which is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Can you hear me?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, we can, sir.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, good. My question is first trying to sort out the guidance. If you take the Q2 through Q4, what's embedded both for sales and margin? Is that roughly the same as what it was, call it, when you guided the year, or has anything changed?\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSimeon, thanks for the question. This is Brandon. Let me just kind of speak a little bit to the curve. Specifically when we look at Q2, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, expecting Q2 sales towards the higher end of the full year guide. That's inclusive of the $250 million delayed spring benefit, offset by the 150 basis points lumber deflation, and then the $400 million weather-shift drag. As we start to transition and look at the second half, we do expect the Pro business is going to continue to outperform and drive our growth. We mentioned that backlogs remained healthy and we expect that business to continue to outpace DIY.\nThe lumber inflation is or deflation is going to moderate as we start to look at second half and we cycle over more normal pricing over the balance of the year, and then continued strength in what we're seeing with the online business and in core DIY businesses like appliances and paint. So, taking all that into account, when we look at the second half, we're looking at that in line with the four year guideline.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's helpful, thanks. Then maybe the follow-up sticking with the guidance. If you looked at whether it was the weak or even the moderate cases beforehand, margins were going to hold up reasonably well for a couple of reasons. A lot of it. Your internal initiatives, those drivers that were holding up margin, are those the same? Are you on a faster trajectory? Are you pivoting? Are you prioritizing some over the other? If you could share some of that, please.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYes, Simeon, largely the same, roughly flat is what we've spoken to as it relates to gross margin over the course of the year. The puts and takes that we've talked through, still relatively consistent.\nThe headwinds from the supply chain expansion and investments in the pro growth initiatives, the benefits, and Bill covered this when he talked through merch productivity, higher private brands penetration, lower commodity transportation costs, and then the pricing initiatives that we're working through. So those largely are going to drive the outputs and then just from an SG&A standpoint, that's where we're going to see the bulk of the leverage, 40 to 60 basis points reflected in the new guide. That's going to offset the planned wage increases and the strategic investments and then on the lower sales, just the change from the previous guide, it's mainly volume related.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thanks everyone. Good luck.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGreat,Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to focus specifically on the Q2 guidance. Just since weather has been so volatile, is there any more detail you can provide about how the business is trending thus far in May? [That] would be helpful.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nHey Steve, this is Marvin. I'll take that. So, Steven, we would basically describe it as in line with our current guidance. The good news is, as we've seen periods of more sustained seasonal weather, we've seen those seasonal categories respond in line to that, and that's geographically specific around West, South, North, and East. But May is performing basically at our current guidance.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nOkay, appreciate that color then. Marvin, I'm curious for your perspective on the potential duration of this weakness we're seeing in discretionary spending. What's your take on how long this potentially could last? There's a lot of macro cross currents at play. So just curious for your opinion.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, it's a really good question, and really, to be quite honest with you, as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time looking at it, but it's just hard to predict. What we can say is that the overall structural drivers for home improvement remain really strong, and so we are bullish to the medium- and long-term health of this business. Things like the savings rate of consumers, and you're looking at pent-up demand, and the housing shortage, the age of homes. I mean, all of these things are still incredibly relevant. When you think about the highest correlating factors to ourselves historically, they remain disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of housing side.\nSo, although we can't predict the duration of what we think will be a more short-term turbulence, we think the medium- and long-term health of this segment is incredibly strong.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nOkay, thanks for the detail. Best of luck for the remainder of spring.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHi, good morning. My first question, Marvin, just maybe a bit of a follow-up on the prior question, but just with respect to the commentary around discretionary, maybe if you could give a little more color on what you're seeing and how do you think about this weakness and discretionary relative to some of the weather disruptions? And then if you look here at Q1, is there anything really noticeably different than what we saw maybe in Q4 on the discretionary side?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSo Bernard, I'll give you some thoughts. I'll let Brandon jump in and provide any additional thoughts. But candidly what we're seeing is pressure across big ticket discretionary purchases. Primarily we're seeing some pressure in small ticket, but it's more pronounced in big ticket and is almost exclusively discretionary DIY. As you know, 75% of our business is penetrated in the DIY customer and Q1 is our most discretionary quarter of the year because of all the seasonal purchases. So when we run into.\nTiming of unseasonal weather, it has a disproportionate impact on our business. So we've been trying to pull apart the difference between discretionary pullback and weather-related non-spending. And so as we look at the month of May as an example, we can start to see more clarity that when the sun comes out and the weather gets a more normalized kind of performance, as you would expect, the business in those discretionary categories have picked up. So that's why Brandon noted that we have an expectation we're going to get roughly $250 million back from delayed spraying. So for us, we're seeing discretionary big-ticket pullback primarily in DIY. The other good news for us is because our Pro consumer and our target consumer is that small- to medium-sized customer, that customer's backlog remains healthy, and that customer spend has been relatively consistent.\nThat's why we're able to positive comp in Pro for the quarter with over 800 basis points of lumber deflation specifically for that consumer. Brandon, I don't know if you have anything else.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nBrian, this is Brandon. I think just looking out a little bit beyond the weather that Marvin just spoke to. We look at this topic of normalization, home improvement share, wallet. Definitely seeing normalization back to services in terms of where discretionary purchases are going from consumers: travel, restaurants, and a shift back to some necessity-based spend, groceries, gas, taking up a larger share of wallet given the inflation that we're seeing. But just as we look at the business at a broad level, units, transactions, well documented back and below in some cases to 2019 levels. But as Marvin mentioned, really nuances within that. We're seeing pro categories in particular, building materials, rough plumbing. Lumber's been a great story with what we've been able to drive with units. And then categories like appliances where we've continued to grow units in share.\nSo all that combined, we are very optimistic in the medium to longer term that the categories where we've seen reversion or normalization, we got a new baseline there to which to manage the business. And then in these other categories that are outrunning, we can continue confidence that we can continue to take share there.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nNo, that's very helpful, I appreciate it. Maybe a follow-up, separately, interesting comments about your rural stores and your strategy there. Anything you could say to help us. Better size this opportunity? Where are the volumes of those units? Now, versus maybe the chain average, or some of your larger volumes? And then, as you think about this Remerchandising effort, I mean, how much could that add over. what time frame to store volumes there?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\n[Inaudible], what I'll do is I'll let Bill give you just some specifics on some of the categories that we're adding. And again, we piloted this for over a year to get the mix right, to get the assortment right. And we came away extremely pleased with the pilot results. And thus we identified roughly 300 stores that we're expanding this to. But I'll let Bill give you some specifics on those categories and what we believe that we can get from them.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah, Brian, this is Bill. So, you know, in my opening remarks I mentioned, you know, some of these key categories in areas like pet. We think there's an opportunity in these rural markets to do more in that category. There's opportunities with apparel. So, you know, the launch of our the Carhartt brand, Wrangler brands gives us an opportunity to do something there in those markets. Then you think around livestock. Really, livestock feed is the consumer is looking for options from us to be able to serve that consumer and then you can get into areas like fencing and some of these small pens that folks will use. We're finding some interesting things with water troughs that are being used, you know, certainly to water livestock, but they're also being used as the decorative piece for a consumer's home where they're planting flowers in it. Just a lot of interesting stuff that we're starting to learn here that the customer is giving us a lot of credit for and wants to see Lowe's carry in their community. That was, you know, part of the early pilot in those few stores that has allowed us to accelerate to get it to 300.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nAnd Brian, this is Marvin again, just last point on that. You know, both, both Bill and I grew up in rural parts of the country, Bill, in rural Montana. I grew up in rural Tennessee. And I think rural Tennessee is actually more rural than rural Montana. But that's for another discussion. We're seeing things like ATVs that we piloted, having no idea if customers would respond. And it's been an incredible growth category for us. And in these rural markets, they're responding really well. So a lot of learning. But what's also interesting is we are finding categories in these rural stores that we think will be relevant in non rural locations. And that's been the beauty of this entire pilot and strategy. And we'll continue to learn. But I'll just repeat what I said in my prepared comments.\nMany of us, including me and many in the marketplace, perceive these rural and remote stores as a true competitive disadvantage to Lowe's. But we've now determined that that is the opposite. We think that these stores give us incredible opportunities to not only grow top line with more improved sales per square foot, but also just the operational profit opportunity with improved technology, improved omnichannel capabilities, and improved efficiencies. I mean, this is something that we're very excited about over the next, call it three to five years.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nVery helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Hey everybody.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. I wanted to just follow up on the May comment. I think you said it was consistent with guidance. I just want to clarify: does that mean consistent with the comment that Q2 would be at the upper end of the range? And then, I think if you step back for a second, you know, your original guidance had assumed some sequential improvement in the Q2. Can you just remind us what some of the drivers of that were going to be? Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nI'll take the first part on May. We tend not to give specific detail on current trends for all the obvious reasons. So I'll leave my comments at May is performing at guidance, and we feel good about what we've seen, areas of sustained weather, and how our seasonal categories are responding in those geographic locations. That's reflective of May's performance. With that, I'll let Brandon answer the second part of your question.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYeah, sure, Seth. Just consistent with the upper end of guidance is what we referred to, and just the components again, the $250 million delayed spring benefit, the lumber deflation is going to step up. So a 350 basis points pressure in Q1, now expecting that to be 150 basis points in Q2. And just a reminder of the weak shift benefit from Q1 is now flipping into Q2, and we expect that to be a $400 million drag. So those are just the components again as it relates to Q2.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGotcha. Okay. Just a follow-up question on average ticket and inflation. It sounds like you still have some of the wrapping of the price increases from last year, but I guess in general, how are you thinking about pricing going forward? Is there an opportunity to maybe roll some prices back and maybe if you could tie in commentary around the elasticity that you're seeing in lumber? I realize that category is a little bit different, but your commentary around the unit volume increase that you saw seemed to be quite strong. So maybe we just tie those two together. Thank you\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nSeth, I can take that as well. When we look at the makeup in terms of ticket and transaction, as you mentioned, we're seeing the pace and cost increases; those have slowed pretty dramatically here over the course of the couple of quarters.\nWe are still expecting a modest level of product inflation as we look out at 2023. Most of that is wrap from pricing actions that we've taken in the second half of last year. We are ex-Lumber; average ticket is actually up in most categories when we look at Q1. The lumber deflationary pressure is expected to continue to impact average ticket in Q2, but not as significant as Q1. Then when we look outside of commodities, we're not anticipating any meaningful deflationary pressure as we move through the year. Mainly the pressure is going to be coming from what Marvin mentioned, the pullback in DIY discretionary, which is going to put pressure on ticket, and that's especially true in the larger ticket bucket.\nSo all in the makeup of the comp and the outlook assumes more pressure overall on transactions, and we expect the average ticket number to hold up.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, thank you for that. Appreciate it.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Is there a view just given that you do cater to the smaller and midsize Pro, just that you can hold up maybe a little bit better given the industry backdrop? With regards to market share, it sounds like there were some wins there during the Q1. Have your share assumptions changed at all based on that for the year?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nKate, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of Pro with Joe, and then we'll let Bill and Brandon provide some market share input. I would first say we're really pleased with our Pro strategy. We spent a lot of time the last four plus years trying to refine this strategy, but also being very disciplined on not trying to overreach beyond our capabilities. And that's why the small to medium Pro has been our target Pro customer. And we feel like we're gaining traction. Anytime you can face over 800 basis points of lumber deflation and comping up against a 22% growth last year still deliver a positive comp, I think it sends a signal that we're making progress. I'll let Joe talk specifically about a couple of the key initiatives that we rolled out that's gaining the most traction. While we feel confident we can continue to take market share in that segment.\n\nJoseph McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's",
    "content2": "Thanks Kate, for the question. As you look at the makeup of our Pro, it is on that smaller side. As we rolled out our MVP's Pro Rewards program, we're really seeing the Pros engage with us in our loyalty. Our credit programs, of course, when they're engaged there, they spend three times more than those not engaged. We've rolled out new CRM insights so we can better anticipate the Pros' needs. We can build those relationships, and you know, with the loyalty program and the CRM system, you know, they continue to improve as they mature, and so really excited about the unlock that is still ahead. Very pleased with the Pro LTR that we're seeing as a result.\nSo we feel we're in a good place. Kate, before I hand it to Bill, I'll just add one additional thing. We did a recent survey in April of our Pro customers, and 75% of those customers came back saying their backlogs were still healthy compared to Q4. That gave us confidence that we still believe that we can grow market share and grow to extra market with this specific customer segments. So, Bill, you can talk about market share.\n\nBill Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's\n\nYeah. So you know, when you look at, you know, market share, obviously it's, you know, it's hard to measure, you know, home improvement share specifically. But we try to, you know, triangulate using data from NAICS TraQline, you know, other data, you know, you know, relevant market, and broader market data. We look at our performance. Obviously, in key categories like we mentioned in our prepared remarks, in areas like appliances where we've had unit growth, we feel like we're picking up share there, in Addition to the Pro growth that we've And the continued acceleration with our online business, gaining traction with private brands, all of that. And those elements kind of give us confidence that we're gaining some share here in these key categories.When you see positive growth in areas like Paint, we also feel like we're gaining share in those areas as well.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nBill, the only thing I would add is just really pleased with the execution of total home strategy. Talk about Pro positive comp with an 800 basis points drag on top of 11 consecutive quarters double-digit growth. Really pleased with the online performance at +6%. So clearly, as we look at share gains both for relevant market and broader home improvement. Confident in what we're seeing. And it gives us confidence when we look at the broader market and our ability to grow 100 to 200 basis points above the market and grow our Pro 2x when we look at 2023 and beyond.\n\nKate McShane\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nThank you, Kate.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Great.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question first. One was on the Rural Pilot. Marvin, you've talked about localization for a couple of years now. A lot of the commentary in the past has been removing lawnmowers in Brooklyn, patio sets in West Philadelphia, you know, Dextain in Scottsdale. You know, when we think about this initiative here, it feels like it's a bit more strategic, more poised to benefit.The top line versus limiting markdowns from the prior localization efforts. So, If we go a bit deeper, is the benefit going to manifest itself more in terms of new customer acquisition or greater wallet share from existing customers? Presumably both.Just trying to understand kind of maybe where it may be more weighted in those pilot stores. That's my first question.Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nJonathan, it's a very good question, and I think it is a combination of both now because in order to add these new categories, we're taking categories out. The categories we're taking out are the ones that were most at risk of being marked down because of the lack of localization. We had what I'll describe as a peanut butter spread on our assortment planning. Because our tools were so inferior, it was almost impossible for the merchants to do any really specific localization. Now we've improved our assortment planning tools. We now have the ability to execute the localization strategy as part of our total home strategy. Because of that, we now know what categories to pull out of these rural stores that were not productive.\nWe're adding in new categories, which will give us the ability to take the customer who's shopping us and shopping other retailers because of the lack of fullness of our assortment. We're getting a larger share of wallet of that customer, and we're also attracting a new customer that's now coming in because we're selling items that is pet that we didn't sell before, that they are now coming to us as a destination. We think this is something that has lots of potential. Not to mention, as we also implement the technology with the retiring of this old legacy system, we can then put in self checkout, and we can put in mobile devices and all the other technology advancements that Joe and Seemantini and team have developed. This is going to also drive increased productivity and profitability in these stores. We think.\nIt's a really clear example of our strategy working, and it all hinges on getting the localization right. Bill, I don't know if you have anything to add.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nI just going to add, Marvin, that the early read in the test stores would tell us that we're getting a new customer coming in categories like pet, like apparel. Those are two of the categories that we had early read on that said we were drawing a new customer to the door, and that's exciting to see.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThat's really helpful. Just a quick follow up on regional trends. Any trends you're seeing in markets where Housing prices have cooled a little bit.I think they were down a bit in April. Any discernible trends in terms of where you're seeing pressure, specifically in markets with cooling home prices?.Thanks.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nWell, Jonathan, you can imagine we're paying close attention to that. The short answer is no. I mean we're not seeing any disproportionate sales impacts in some of these markets, and we're tracking these markets very aggressively and paying very close attention to them.\n\nJonathan Matuszewski\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nBest of luck.\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease go ahead. Kate, I'm sorry.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nApologies. Go ahead, Rob.\n\nOperator\n\nI was just going to announce our final question, Kate. That's coming from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I'll ask my two together just in the interest of time. The first one, guys, can you just expand on how the Q1 Pro compared to your internal expectations, ex lumber deflation? Seems like a big highlight during the quarter and wanted to know if you sort of identified what drove the outperformance, whether it's simply wild share or accelerated new Pro growth. The quick follow up is Just around the progress against the OpEx productivity initiatives, any quantification of where you are versus. Those OpEx productivity goals as of the Q1 and or what the guidance implies for a year end goal?\n\nMarvin Ellison\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Lowe's\n\nSteven, I'll take the pro question. I'll give Brandon the productivity question. The short answer is pro did outperform our expectations. Candidly, we didn't anticipate 800 basis points of impact to lumber deflation for that specific customer. The fact that we were able to deliver positive comp, it actually exceeded our expectations. I think it comes down to what you heard Joe mention earlier, and that is the maturity of our MVP's Pro Rewards program and our CRM tool.\nThe increased Pro-related national brands that Bill and his team have worked to get added to the assortment, and our improved fulfillment capabilities that Don Friesen, the supply chain team, in partnership with operations, have really worked to create a more seamless ability for Pros to get product, and not to mention the improved digital capabilities that help to deliver a 6% online comp during the quarter as well. We think all those things combine, and we believe that we'll continue to lean into those initiatives to drive continued market share gain.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nEVP and CFO, Lowe's\n\nBrandon, Steven, I'll speak to PPI. Very much in line with our expectations there, mentioned earlier, 40 to 60 basis points of EBITDA expansion planned this year. We have a really aggressive portfolio, a roadmap of initiatives across the business, across every function set to drive operational efficiencies. We've mentioned a few of those today: store tech modernization, front end transformation, to name a few. Really aggressive plans, and we're very much seeing those come to fruition in line with how we've guided.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThank you.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lowe's\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at our annual shareholders meeting this Friday, and on our Q2 earnings call in August.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the Lowe's Q1 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.\nAdditionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin R. Ellison\n\nExecutive Vice President-US Stores, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 1.5%, while U.S. comps decreased 0.7%.\nFor the quarter, commodity deflation impacted U.S. comps by 75 basis points. Our investments in the Pro customers continue to pay dividends for the company reflected by our continued strong Pro sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, this is the 11th consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth in the U.S. despite stronger-than-expected commodity deflation.\nAnd while there was continued solid DIY demand in core home improvement categories, as expected, we saw a DIY pullback on holiday gift buying. Despite a modest decrease in sales, we once again improved our adjusted operating margin by maintaining our disciplined focus on productivity.\nDuring the quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded approximately 88 basis points leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.28, a 28% increase compared to last year. These results cap off solid financial performance for fiscal 2022 with sales of $97.1 billion, adjusted operating margin of 13%, and adjusted earnings per share of $13.81 up 15% over the prior year.\nWith these results, we're awarding $220 million in discretionary and profit-sharing bonuses to our associates, which includes an incremental $70 million for our assistant store managers and supply chain supervisors who hold 2 of the most critical frontline leadership roles in the company. This builds on our recent $170 million investment in permanent wage increases for our frontline, hourly associates, which went into effect in December.\nSince 2018, we've invested over $3 billion in incremental wages and share-based compensation for our frontline associates, including increasing associate wages by over 20%. And as we mentioned at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, we are committed to additional frontline wage investments over the next several years, which are contemplated in our long-term targets. These compensation investments are just one reflection of our commitment to becoming the employer of choice in retail, which Joe will discuss in more detail.\nThroughout the quarter, we continued to gain traction with our Total Home Strategy as consumers remain engaged in home-related activities. In Pro, we delivered U.S. growth of 10% and 36% on a 2-year basis. We are capitalizing on our momentum with our Pro by growing our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, building relationships through our CRM tool and continuing to enhance our product assortment to meet Pro needs.\nOne example of enhancing our Pro product assortment is the exciting news that client tools will be coming back to Lowe's. We know that our Pros are officially loyal to certain national brands and Klein is the #1 hand tool brand among electrical and HVAC professionals. This creates immediate credibility across trades. Bill will share more detail on this exciting addition to our assortment later in the call.\nNow one question many of you have asked is about our Pro backlog and if they're still healthy. We're in constant communication with our Pros through formal surveys, our Pro counsel and countless day-to-day conversations. In our January survey, more than 70% of Pros stated that they were booked out the same or more compared to 2022, and they remain confident in their ability to find jobs and hold on to their backlog. We believe this dynamic is being fueled by all the things we talked about at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, which includes homeowners with strong balance sheets and record levels of equity.\nOn Lowes.com, sales grew 5% on top of 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, partly due to strong appliance sales. This represents a 2-year comp of 17% and more than 11% sales penetration. We continue to remove friction from the customers' online experience, which includes adding Apple Pay this quarter to improve conversion.\nWe're also focused on removing friction from our customers' omnichannel shopping journeys, like for appliances where customers often shop our showrooms before making their purchase online. We also continue to make strides in the rollout of our market delivery model for appliances and other big and bulky products.\nWe added 2 new geographic areas this quarter, bringing us to 10 geographic regions across the country supporting more than 1,000 stores. And as a reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes replacing our inefficient store delivery model. This delivery model is enabling us to further consolidate our industry leadership position in appliances and it positions us for profitable growth and other big and bulky product categories like grills, riding lawnmowers and stock cabinets.\nTurning to Canada. We completed the sale of our Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners this quarter. As a result, we are now solely focused on the transformation of our U.S. business, where we estimate we have a $1 trillion addressable home improvement market, enabling us to invest more into higher-return opportunities to grow our business and to take market share. I'd like to extend my appreciation to the entire Canadian team for their commitment to serving our customers, and I wish them the best as they move forward under new ownership.\nBefore I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market. And as you know, there is a wide range of conflicting opinions on what's going to happen in the macro environment in 2023. From our perspective, the core drivers of our business, disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of housing stock, remain supportive. Consumer savings are still roughly $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic with 85% concentrated in the top 40% of income earners who are more likely to be homeowners. Homeowners continue to enjoy record levels of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average. Even if there is a modest decline in home prices, the level of equity built up during the pandemic would not be meaningfully eroded. And the housing stock continues to age with 50% of U.S. homes over 41 years old, the oldest since World War II.\nThese factors, along with strong millennial household formation, baby boomers' increasing preference to age in place and more widespread remote work will continue to be tailwinds for our business.\nAnd given the slowdown in housing turnover is driven by higher rates and low supply rather than demand, we continue to see a nationwide trend of trading up in place with consumers opting to upgrade their existing home to meet their evolving needs. All of these dynamics give us confidence in the medium- and longer-term outlook for the industry.\nThat being said, we also know that consumers are weary of a potential recession, which is reflected in some of the discretionary pullback we experienced during the holiday season. We're closely monitoring trends and we have a proven playbook to pivot quickly if the macro softens.\nOur results in the fourth quarter demonstrate our operational agility, which is reflected in our ability to leverage expenses and deliver productivity in a negative comp sales environment. This gives our experienced leadership team confidence in our ability to effectively manage the business in a wide variety of macro scenario.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their commitment to serving customers day in and day out. As I travel to country every week visiting stores, I continue to be impressed by their passion for helping customers and their communities.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam P. Boltz\n\nExecutive Vice President - Merchandising, Lowe's Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales decreased slightly by 0.7%, though sales were up 34.4% on a 3-year basis, reflecting continued momentum with the Pro and resilience in core DIY home improvement demand.\nWe delivered positive comps in home decor, fueled by key categories like appliances, paint, and kitchen and bath. And we delivered strong growth in our Building Products division, excluding the impacts of commodity deflation. We are particularly encouraged by the Pro strength we're seeing across categories, including rough plumbing, building materials, paint and millwork as we continue to expand our product and service offerings to meet their needs.\nAnd consistent with our Total Home Strategy, we continue to add brands relevant to Pros, including 4 new partnerships. First, we're adding a portfolio of drinks from Coca-Cola to reduce the number of stops Pros make before going to the job site, which is important since time is money for these customers.\nSecond, we are adding Carhartt Apparel that's popular with both our Pro and our DIY consumer especially in our rural stores.\nThird, we have entered a new national partnership with Hubbell, giving us access to all of their Pro branded electrical boxes, including Bell, TayMac and RACO. And fourth, we are excited to be bringing back client tools. As Marvin mentioned, this is the #1 hand tool brand among electrical and HVAC professionals. So this is just a big deal for us and our Pros.\nWe are also really excited to announce that Lowe's will offer the widest selection of client products anywhere in the home improvement retail channel, which will be available in the second half of 2023.\nOur initial selection of client tools will include hand tools and electrical test and measurement tools, followed by a multiyear rollout of new product innovations. Fine Tools, Hubble, Carhartt and Coca-Cola are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\nAs we gain momentum with the Pro, we continue to see brands come to Lowe's and in many cases, come back to Lowe's because they recognize our newfound recommitment to the Pro and see the opportunity to grow with us.\nShifting to our merchandising division performance for the quarter. In home decor, appliances, paint and kitchens and baths led the way. Appliances grew across both Pro and DIY as we continue to gain market share in this critical category. Growth was bolstered by our new instant savings capability that automatically applies supplier rebates to a customer's order, making it much easier and faster for them to take advantage of these offers, which are supported by the manufacturer. This replaces our cumbersome mail-in rebates with real-time savings, both in stores and online to remove friction for the customer and improve conversion. This innovation is another example of Lowe's leapfrogging the competition with technology that not only improves the customer experience, but also drives labor productivity.\nPaint was another standout category with solid pro-growth fueled by our MVPs Pro Paint Rewards and Pro JobSIGHT delivery. We're also seeing an uptick in paint attachments items like applicators, paint sundries and caulk as we upgrade our paint departments across our stores. This upgrade is strategically designed to make it easier for our customers to get everything they need in one trip.\nWe also began the launch of STAINMASTER paint, a high-quality, high-value solution for busy families looking to protect their walls from fingerprints and other messes. This is Lowe's first-ever private brand paint and early results are already outperforming our expectations.\nOur focus on driving private brand penetration is well timed enabling us to capitalize on the nationwide trend of increasing customer preference for private brands.\nAnother category that outperformed this quarter is kitchens and bath. We were particularly encouraged to see a strong increase in demand for custom cabinets driven by improved lead times as well as an expanded suite of digital tools, along with our team of talented virtual designers, all of which help our customers tailor the right solutions for their budgets and design preferences.\nTurning to the Building Products division. We delivered strong, broad-based growth, excluding the impacts of commodity deflation across copper and lumber. We delivered strong positive comps across rough plumbing, building materials and millwork driven by Pro demand and continued DIY investment in the home.\nOur performance in hard lines was consistent with broader consumer trends as we saw a decrease in holiday gift buying compared to the prior year. However, the team still delivered a solid holiday season with sell-throughs above 2019 levels. As expected, consumers reverted to more typical holiday buying patterns as compared to last year when we saw a widespread early buying due to supply chain concerns.\nAs we look ahead, we continue to build on our customers' preference for new and innovative products with continued enhancements to our product assortments. We are expanding on our popular Kobalt 24-Volt platform with new tools and technology that customers have been asking for, including a cordless Kobalt nailer that can instantly fire 1,100 nails on a single charge, eliminated the need to drag an air compressor and a hose around the job site.\nWe're also excited about our new EGO zero turn radius mower with the industry's first e-STEER technology. With the sleek, intuitive steering wheel that increases the driver's control and precision, powered by the EGO battery system that now allows this unit to mow 3 acres on a single charge.\nWe are ready to capitalize on spring with the best in-stock positions that we've had in 3 years, right on time to support our biggest selling season of the year. In addition to an enhanced assortment and strong in-stock levels, we're also making strides in driving merchandising productivity as part of our enterprise-wide perpetual productivity improvement initiatives.\nAs one of the larger importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and reduce our import and domestic transportation costs. As the cost of transportation and raw materials come down, we are working with our suppliers to ensure that our prices are competitive to support sales and to protect our margins.\nWe have sophisticated cost optimization tools that track prices of the underlying components of the products we sell. So the teams are well informed for these discussions. We are also holding our suppliers accountable to drive out costs through their productivity just as we are doing throughout our own organization.\nWe are also partnering with our suppliers through our Lowe's One Roof Media Network. Some of our top suppliers have already locked in sizable contracts for 2023, and we are excited to partner with them to strategically target the home improvement shopper to drive traffic on Lowes.com and convert to sale.\nBefore I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and our inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendor partners for their hard work and continued support throughout 2022. I'm looking forward to what we will accomplish together in 2023 as we continue to find ways to provide value to our shared customers.\nThank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Michael McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers and delivering another solid year of operating results. Associates are the heart of any retailer, but even more so in our industry where customers rely on our associates' product knowledge as they look for the right solutions to repair and upgrade their homes. That's why we are so focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail, where associates chose to stay to build their careers.\nAs Marvin mentioned, we've made substantial wage investments over the last 4 years, and we constantly review each market and monitor candidate flow to help us remain competitive and maintain a robust hiring pool in all geographic areas of the company.\nBeyond competitive compensation, we offer comprehensive benefits, flexible scheduling options and bonus opportunities. As we close out the year, we are excited to award $220 million in discretionary and profit sharing bonuses. This includes $70 million for our assistant store managers and supply chain supervisors with an incremental $7,500 bonus this quarter on top of their annual incentive bonus, and we are one of only a handful of retailers to offer share-based compensation for our ASMs and which incentivizes them to build their careers at Lowe's. These critical leaders are undoubtedly some of the hardest working leaders in our company, and they are at the forefront of creating a culture focused on exceptional customer service.\nIn addition to recognizing these leaders, we are also awarding $150 million to eligible hourly associates in recognition of their efforts this year. Based on continuous associate listening we also added other improvements this quarter, including sick leave for part-time associates in revamping our store break rooms with higher quality, lower-cost, food options. Our investments in our people have helped us build more than 80% of leadership positions from within over the last year with more than 90% of our store leaders starting as hourly associates.\nAs we enter spring, our busiest time of year, I'm pleased that we have the best staffing levels that we've had in 3 years. Our focus on associates also translates into how we're serving the Pro, which is our biggest opportunity for growth. This quarter, we launched a Know the Pro training, helping our associates understand how to better serve Pro customers across the entire store, not just at the Pro desk. This training supported storewide participation in key Q4 Pro events, including the most successful PROVember we've ever had as well as our MVPs bonus days, which exceeded expectations.\nI would like to thank our associates, especially our Pro team for delivering outstanding results, driving U.S. Pro comps of 10% for the quarter, 36% on a 2-year basis despite commodity deflation.\nWe continue to leverage our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to capitalize on this demand by engaging Pros, incentivizing purchases and building long-term loyalty. Our program is designed to make every Pro feel like an MVP regardless of their size, giving small to midsize Pros, access to bonus points, savings and exclusive offers that they can't get elsewhere.\nWe're pleased to see the results continue to exceed expectations as reflected in our 200 basis points increase in Pro customer satisfaction scores in Q4.\nShifting gears to our focus on productivity. We continue to make progress with our PPI or perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. One of the key objectives of PPI is simplifying our associates jobs while removing friction for our customers. This approach allows us to generate productivity and cost savings in the store while simultaneously improving customer service.\nOne great example of this is the transition of our outdated legacy technology to our new modern omnichannel systems. We just completed the conversion at our returns desk with easy-to-use touchscreens that enable associates to quickly scan items and process to correct return value, with the system automatically accounting for return policies and promotions. This simplifies the return experience for customers, gives our suppliers more insights to improve product quality, while also making it easier for associates to enforce our policies and manage complex returns.\nWe also continue to roll out new tools, including 90,000 additional Zebra smartphones by the end of June, to ensure all associates walking the sales floor have a device, including our MST associates.\nOur leadership team knows that when we make things easier for our associates, they make things easier for our customers. And our new returns process is just one example of the dozens of initiatives underway to do just that. And of course, none of this would be possible without our associates.\nFor our associates tuning in, thank you for your ongoing focus on serving customers and driving productivity. We appreciate your hard work.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 compared to $1.78 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable.\nExcluding the $441 million of pretax transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business, we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.28, an increase of 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This increase was driven by our continued focus on productivity as well as disciplined capital allocation. Q4 sales were $22.4 billion, which includes approximately $1.4 billion in sales generated in the 14th week. Comparable sales declined 1.5%.\nU.S. comp sales were down 0.7% in the quarter with comp average ticket up 4.8% driven by product inflation and higher Pro sales partly offset by 75 basis points of lumber deflation. This was offset by a comp transaction decline of 5.5%.\nSales in Canada totaled $958 million, a decline of 18% in USD on a comparable basis, partly driven by exchange rate unfavorability due to a stronger dollar and lumber deflation.\nFX represented a 25 basis point headwind to consolidated comps. Of note, both the Canadian sales decline and lumber deflation pressured our Q4 comps more than expected. U.S. Pro sales were up 10% in the quarter despite lumber and copper deflation.\nOn Lowes.com, sales increased 5% in the quarter, partly driven by continued strength in appliance. Our U.S. monthly comps improved as we moved through the quarter, with comps down 3.1% in November due to DIY pullback on discretionary holiday spending. In December, comps were down 0.2%, with comps turning positive in January, up 1.4%, reflecting continued DIY investment in the home.\nGross margin was 32.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 60 basis points from last year. Product margin rate improved 15 basis points versus the prior year. Gross margins also benefited from 30 basis points of favorable product mix due to a lower percentage of lumber sales.\nHigher product margin rate was offset by 40 basis points related to the expansion of our supply chain network, 30 basis points of pressure from shrink and 35 basis points of pressure from our private label credit portfolio.\nAdjusted SG&A of 20.9% of sales levered 131 basis points relative to Q4 2021 despite a modest decline in sales as we executed on our PPI initiatives across the company.\nAdjusted operating margin rate of 9.6% of sales levered 88 basis points as adjusted SG&A leverage was partly offset by lower gross margin rate.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate was 24% below prior year levels. Inventory ended the quarter at $18.5 billion, which now solely reflects the inventory for our U.S. business as we closed on the sale of the Canadian retail business on February 3.\nInventory is up $0.9 billion from the same quarter last year, largely driven by product inflation with units down slightly to prior year. We continue to shift our inventory mix more towards Pro categories as we invest to drive future growth.\nNow let me turn to capital allocation. In 2022, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $16.5 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we paid $643 million in dividends at $1.05 per share and repurchased 10 million shares for $2 billion. This brought the total to $14.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations for approximately $13 billion. This reflected better-than-expected operating performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders.\nWe ended the quarter at 2.44x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. And finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 30.4%, inclusive of an 800 basis point impact related to transaction cost associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business.\nTurning to our 2023 financial outlook, which we introduced this morning. As Marvin indicated, the long-term outlook for home improvement remains strong. However, in 2023, residential investment will be under some pressure. Given elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates and a more cautious consumer, we are forecasting a slight decline in the home improvement market.\nWe expect to continue to outperform the market in 2023 with sales ranging from $88 billion to $90 billion. Comparable sales are expected to be in a range of flat to down 2%. Keep in mind that 2023 comparable sales will be calculated based on weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2022.\nPro sales growth is expected to exceed DIY again in 2023 as we expect to continue to outpace the broader Pro market growth by 2x. We will continue to build on our momentum with the Pro with our new MVPs Pro Loyalty Program, CRM tools, and our expanded Pro brand lineup. We are expecting operating margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8% as we continue to drive productivity through our PPI initiatives across the organization in part to offset our planned wage investments.\nFor 2023, we are expecting to invest $350 million in incremental wages for our frontline associates, which includes the 2023 portion of the $170 million permanent wage investment that went into effect in December.\nWe expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year and with our planned share repurchases -- we also expect to reach our 2.75x leverage target in 2023, while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating. Our strong operating performance and shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy is expected to deliver approximately $13.60 to $14 in earnings per share for the year.\nKeep in mind that there was an approximate $0.25 contribution to adjusted EPS from the 53rd week in our Canadian business in 2022. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for first half performance, which is an easier comparison from a sales perspective.\nHowever, when we consider the impact of lower lumber prices, we are expecting a nearly 300 basis point headwind to sales in the first quarter and a 100 basis point headwind to sales in the second quarter. Given these impacts, we expect our first quarter sales comps to be below our full year guidance range and our second quarter sales comps to be above our full year guidance range.\nIn closing, I'm confident that the combination of our strong operating results and our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategies will continue to deliver meaningful, long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, we will open it up for questions.",

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of IR, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President of Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin R. Ellison\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our total company comparable sales increased 2.2%, while U.S. comps increased 3%. These better-than-expected sales were driven by improved DIY demand supported by fall nesting trends as travel slowdown and children return to school.\nWe also saw continued momentum in Pro, reflecting the success of our Pro initiatives and the resilience of home improvement demand. In addition to strong sales growth, our persistent focus on productivity once again drove improved operating performance with substantial improvement in adjusted operating margin of 54 basis points and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27, an increase of 20% as compared to last year.\nThese outstanding results enable us to make critical investments in our most important asset, our associates. In this quarter, we announced an incremental $170 million investment in permanent wage increases for our frontline hourly associates. These increases are designed to ensure that our more tenured associates continue to receive market-competitive wages.\nAnd in further recognition of the hard work and dedication, we are awarding $200 million in bonuses to our frontline hourly associates ahead of the holiday season. At Lowe's, we make every effort to ensure that our associates share in our financial success, and I am very pleased that we are once again able to award a discretionary bonus because our performance is tracking ahead of our expectations.\nThis is a true win-win outcome for the company, for our shareholders and for our associates. All of these investments reflect our efforts and our commitment to become the employee of choice in retail, where we continually invest in our associates and help them support their families and grow their careers at Lowe's.\nNow turning to Pro. We delivered growth of 16% and 36% on a 2-year basis, the tenth consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth. We are building on our greatly improved Pro product and service offerings with our new MVP Pro Rewards and Partnership Program and our enhanced Pro CRM, which Joe will discuss later on the call. We recently completed our annual Pro Pulse Survey, which provides real-time insights into what's on the minds of our Pros and how they view their future business opportunities, and we're encouraged to hear that Pros remain optimistic with over 70% saying that they expect even more work in 2023 than they had in 2022. This is just another proof point of the resilience of home improvement demand even in this uncertain macro environment.\nOn Lowes.com sales grew 12% this quarter over 4x our U.S. growth rate, representing a sales penetration of 10%. We continue to enhance the online user experience as well as our fulfillment capabilities as we focus on driving this critical growth initiative within our Total Home Strategy.\nTurning to our supply chain transformation. We've made significant strides in our rollout of our market delivery model for big and bulky products this quarter, spanning the country from Southern California to Southern Illinois to Atlanta, Georgia. We've now reached an important milestone with 8 geographic regions covering more than half our stores converted to the new model, and we're on track to complete the rollout by the end of next year.\nThis is a centerpiece of our supply chain transformation as the market delivery model will enable us to further consolidate our industry leadership position in appliances and position us for profitable growth in other big and bulky products like grills, riding lawn mowers, stock cabinets and vanities. This also improves the customer experience through expanded fulfillment options and a seamless omnichannel shopping experience powered by technology.\nWe also just announced that we will be opening a new coastal holding facility in the port city of Suffolk, Virginia. Our expanded coastal holding facility network is opening up capacity for us to hold product upstream from our distribution centers, which creates the flexibility we need to flow the products quickly and where and when is needed. This helps us to not only capture sales, but also mitigates markdown risk because we avoid stranding product unnecessarily in our stores.\nAnd now I'd like to discuss the macro environment and specifically address some misperceptions that I've heard about the home improvement market. You've heard me talk about this before, but demand drivers for home improvement are distinctly different from those that drive home building. So it's important not to confuse the two. And as a reminder, at Lowe's, the 3 highest correlating factors of home improvement demand are home price appreciation, age of housing stock and disposable personal income.\nSo let's start with home price appreciation. Even if there is a broad-based decline in home prices, homeowners currently have a record amount of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average, which remains supportive of home improvement investment. And even in the select U.S. markets where home prices have declined after a particularly steep run-up during the pandemic, we are not seeing any impact to sales; second, the average age of homes in the U.S. is over 40 years old and roughly 3 million more homes built during the housing boom in the mid-2000s, will be entering prime remodeling years by 2025, which is a key inflection point for big-ticket repairs.\nThis is one of the key reasons why 2/3 of home improvement spend is nondiscretionary on repair or maintenance projects that cannot be delayed; third, consumer savings are near record highs, while disposable personal income remained strong. And more than 90% of homeowners either own their home or are locked into a low fixed mortgage insulating them from rising rates.\nOn top of these 3 factors, there is a persistent 1.5 million to 2 million under supply of homes and 250,000 first-time millennial homebuyers are expected per year through 2025. This unique combination of factors is causing homeowners to trade up in place, preferring to invest in repairs and renovations to make their current homes meet their families evolving needs rather than buying a new home. And this is why we're so confident about the outlook for the home improvement industry even in a period of high inflation and rising interest rates because the key drivers of our business remain supportive.\nAnd with the investments that we've made to transform our business, we also have the operating agility needed to rapidly pivot if market conditions worsen. And we have a very experienced leadership team of home improvement veterans who have developed a proven playbook to respond to a slowdown. At the same time, we would not lose our focus on investing in long-term growth. Now before I close, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our recent announcement regarding our intention to sell our Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners.\nLowe's first entered Canada in 2007 and later expanded with the acquisition of RONA in 2016. Over the last few years, we focus on the retail fundamentals of our Canadian operations, which brought the Canadian business to profitability and improved its operating cash flows. However, for this business to achieve the profitability in line with the U.S. significant incremental capital investments would be required to streamline the banners and improve operating margins.\nBy contrast, we have tremendous opportunity for continued market share and profitable growth in our U.S. home improvement business. This transaction will simplify our business model, improve our operating margins and return on invested capital while enabling us to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders.\nBrandon will provide details regarding the financial impact of the transaction later on the call. I would like to thank our entire Canadian team for their hard work and dedication to our customers, and we look forward to collaborating with Sycamore Partners and executing a seamless transition. I'd like to also extend my appreciation to our team in the U.S. for their ongoing commitment to serving customers and the communities. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam P. Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, U.S. comparable sales increase 3%, reflecting solid core home improvement demand across both Pro and DIY customers. This quarter, we drove positive comps in our building products and home decor divisions, fueled by momentum with the Pro and improve DIY demand. In hardlines, comps were down slightly as we cycled over significant storm prep activities in Louisiana from Hurricane Ida in 2021 and that did not repeat at the same scale when flu radiances prepared for Hurricane Ian in 2022.\nOverall, growth was well balanced with 8 of our 15 merchandising departments above company average. Beginning with our home decor division, the fall nesting trends that Marvin mentioned led to standout performance across core interior categories, including appliances, paint, kitchens and bath and flooring. Appliance sales were bolstered by a strong Labor Day event and higher online sales as we continue to enhance our Lowes.com user experience.\nAs an example, this quarter, we began displaying delivery dates earlier in the purchase process to highlight our improved next-day delivery options. If customer needed to quickly replace a refrigerator or washer that's just stopped working, this feature now helps them focus their attention to product that's immediately available. This is especially important for Lowe's as our appliance business is skewed toward replacement within existing homes versus new housing starts. As I mentioned last quarter, we also continue to see customers trading up for innovation, like with our new Maytag Pet Pro washer with technology that removes pet hair from clothes in the wash cycle, which is exclusive to Lowe's.\nThis quarter, we also launched a new exclusive home center partnership with Miele, a global leader known for high-end premium appliances. This reflects our ongoing commitment to ensuring that we have new high-quality offerings across all price points with leading products from All-Star brands like Trex, DEWALT, Owens Corning, John Deere, EGO, Honda, KitchenAid, Samsung, LG, Kohler, Moen, Whirlpool, Husqvarna and Aaron's.\nPaint delivered strong positive comps this quarter across both Pro and DIY. Many of our Pros, especially those who focus on repair and remodel work, paint is part of their larger jobs. In other words, these are Pros who paint rather than professional painters. And these Pros are starting to see the value of our new MVPs Pro Paint Rewards Program paired with our expanded job site delivery for paint. These enhanced benefits and capabilities are making it more convenient and cost-effective for Pros to purchase their paint directly from Lowe's, earning us more of their business. In our continued partnership with Sherwin-Williams, we are also upgrading our paint departments across the U.S., including a new color wall that converts all HGTV colors to Sherwin-Williams colors, which resonates with both DIY and Pro customers.\nWith our new color wall, we are bringing all the colors together so that customers can easily match their favorite Sherwin-Williams paint color at our paint desk. We are also resetting some categories to pull relevant, higher margin and more frequently purchased products closer to the front of the department, make it easier for customers to get everything they need for their paint project in one trip. We plan to have half of our stores converted to this new color wall by the end of this year and roll it out everywhere by the end of next year. We are very pleased with the progress we've made in this core category in just a few short years. We are gaining traction with both the Pro and DIY, and this recent update highlights just a few ways that we plan to continue to take market share in paint.\nWe also had strong positive comps in kitchens and bath, largely driven by improved in-stocks for cabinets and customers opting to trade up for larger, higher quality in-stock cabinets versus waiting for custom orders. Within flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as busy homeowners returning to durable, low maintenance flooring options available in popular brands like Pergo and STAINMASTER. And we're gaining momentum across our private brand portfolio, especially in STAINMASTER, Origin 21, allen + roth and Cobalt as this is just another indication of the traction that we are gaining with our Total Home Strategy.\nTurning to our performance in building products division. We continue to see broad-based balanced growth across Pro and DIY in millwork, rough plumbing, electrical, lumber and building materials, driven by strong project-related demand. We are encouraged by the DIY strength that emerged in building products this quarter as lumber prices have come down DIY consumers are reengaging in home improvement projects, they had previously put on hold leading to double-digit lumber comps in the quarter.\nIn our hardlines division, as lumber demand increased, so as demand for related attachments categories like fasteners, leading to our strong positive comps in hardware. We also continue to see a trend of customers investing in innovation. Our EGO battery now powers 75 different tools, everything from traditional outdoor power equipment like mowers, trimmers and leaf blowers to lifestyle products like camping generators and misting fans. And with the accelerated growth in battery-powered products that we're seeing, it's not surprising that EGO continues to lead the pack in battery-powered outdoor power equipment.\nGiven the concerns in the marketplace, some of you have asked if we're seeing a shift away from discretionary purchases, which is what we typically expect to see in a softer macro environment. And the straightforward answer is no. We had a strong sell-through in Halloween this year with an early sell-out of our 12-foot Lighted Animated Mummy at a price point over $300. One could argue that this is one of the most discretionary items we sell. And with Halloween in total being a highly discretionary category, this continues to give us a positive indication of the strength of our consumer.\nWe kicked off the holiday season with our trim and tree sets early in the quarter. We are seeing early sell-through on taller, higher-end artificial Christmas trees, which is another example of both discretionary purchasing and consumers trading up. Before I close, I'd like to thank our merchants, supply chain team and our vendor partners for their hard work and the continued partnership as they continue to provide our customers with the products that they need as we support our stores and communities in the recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian.\nThank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Michael McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a heartfelt thank you to our associates. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct reflection of their hard work and dedication to providing excellent customer service. That's why we are so focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail where associates choose to stay to build their careers. At its core, that means providing good, stable jobs, comprehensive benefits, competitive wages and bonus opportunities.\nAs Marvin mentioned, this quarter, we announced $170 million in permanent wage increases and we are awarding $200 million in bonuses ahead of the holiday season for our frontline hourly associates. This translates to up to $1,000 for eligible full-time associates and up to $500 for eligible part-time associates. As someone who started my career as an hourly associate in home improvement, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition can be.\nOur executive leadership team is passionate about rewarding our associates and taking care of our customers, which is demonstrated in the investments we make in both our people and in the communities we serve.\nAnother example of these investments in action is the transformation of our disaster response capabilities over the last few years, which dramatically improved our ability to support communities through devastating storms like Hurricane Ian. Year round, Lowe's now has a cross-functional command center dedicated to supporting our disaster response efforts. In fact, it was these enhanced capabilities that enabled us to respond so effectively to the pandemic.\nWe also deploy our emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas. These associates volunteer to lead their home stores, giving their colleagues in the impacted areas, a chance to focus on their families, and we go a step further to help impacted associates by deploying refueling stations and our mobile disaster relief trailers with showers, washers, dryers and meals and offering financial assistance through our Lowe's employee relief fund.\nIn addition to demonstrating the importance of our improved disaster response capabilities, Hurricane Ian also spotlighted the value of our expanded omnichannel fulfillment options. Earlier in the quarter, Lowe's rolled out same-day delivery nationwide with more than 1,700 stores now supported by Instacart.\nThis partnership allows us to deliver over 30,000 items stocked in our stores that weigh up to 60 pounds to our customers. In the days leading up to the storm, we received thousands of these same-day orders to help customers prepare and protect their homes. Customers were able to get critical items they needed like water, sand, buckets and batteries without having to leave their homes, and it continues to be a helpful option for many who need supplies in the wake of the storm.\nAnd we continue to optimize our parcel network in Q3, another important step in our journey to enhance our omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. We rebalanced our network to ensure our parcel stores are optimally located close to shipping hubs, and we have upgraded our technology and hardware to support faster fulfillment. Ahead of the holidays, we are on track to meet our goal of decreasing shipping times by 50%. And these are just a few of many examples of our tenacious focus on perpetual productivity improvements or PPI that are scaling across our stores over time.\nShifting to Pro, I would like to thank our Pro team for delivering outstanding results once again this quarter, driving Pro comps over 16% for the quarter and 36% on a 2-year basis. We are leveraging our new MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to capitalize on this continued demand by engaging Pros and incentivizing purchases and building long-term loyalty. Our program is laser-focused on helping Pros grow their business because we know that when Pros succeed, we succeed. This partnership-based approach is already paying off with higher-than-expected adoption rates and overwhelmingly positive feedback from our Pros.\nWe recently asked all of our regional Vice Presidents to find Pros who do not want to sign up for our loyalty program so we can talk to them and understand why, but that proved to be a real challenge because once Pros hear the benefits, they are eager to join. So awareness and continued execution will be the key to our ongoing success. As I close, I would like to thank our associates once again for their commitment to Lowe's and our customers. Without them, the strong results that we delivered this quarter would not be possible.\nNow I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe. I would like to begin this morning by providing additional details regarding our recent announcement of our intention to sell our Canadian business. As Marvin mentioned, despite making meaningful progress in improving our Canadian retail business over the past few years, it has continued to lag our U.S. operations and sales growth, operating profit and return on invested capital. In fact, the Canadian business represents approximately 60 basis points of dilution on our full year operating margin outlook. And during the quarter, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $2.1 billion related to this business.\nLooking ahead, this transaction makes us a U.S.-focused business and gives us a clear line of sight to meaningful long-term improvement of our sales productivity, operating margin and return on invested capital in particular. We are excited to share our updated financial targets at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference in December.\nTurning to our Q3 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.25 compared to $2.73 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. Excluding the $2.1 billion asset impairment charge, we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27, an increase of 20% compared to third quarter of 2021. This increase was driven by a combination of top line growth, strong P&L management and disciplined capital allocation.\nQ3 sales were $23.5 billion with comparable sales up 2.2%. Comparable average ticket increased 8%, driven by product inflation, 80 basis points of commodity inflation and higher Pro sales. Of note, FX represented a 30-basis point headwind to consolidated comps. Higher average ticket was partly offset by comp transactions declining 5.8%.\nOf note, comp transactions have improved significantly as we move through the year with Q3 over 730 basis points higher than Q1 and 60 basis points higher than Q2. U.S. comp sales were up 3% in the quarter, while sales in Canada were down 10.2% in USD, with roughly half of the decline attributable to a stronger dollar.\nPro sales were up 16% in the quarter, driven by broad-based strength across all categories. DIY sales trends improved from Q2 with strong performance across many core home improvement categories as consumers spent more time at home following summer travel activity. DIY project-related demand also increased sequentially due to lower lumber prices. On Lowes.com, sales increased 12% in the quarter partly driven by strong appliance sales. Finally, we estimate that the net effect of storm-related sales year-over-year was relatively flat as we cycled over Hurricane Ida in the prior year.\nOur U.S. monthly comps were up 4% in August, 3.4% in September and 1.4% in October. On a 3-year basis, U.S. comps increased 33.5% in August, 37.8% in September and 42.1% in October. Gross margin was 33.3% of sales in the third quarter, up 20 basis points from last year. Product margin rate was up 110 basis points versus the prior year as we cycled over a lumber margin pressure in the third quarter of 2021, which was triggered by a steep decline in prices that began last July.\nHigher product margin rate was partly offset by 30 basis points related to higher domestic and import transportation costs as well as the expansion of our supply chain network, along with 35 basis points of pressure from shrink. Adjusted SG&A of 18.7% of sales levered 41 basis points driven by higher sales and substantial improvement in productivity. Adjusted operating profit was $3 billion, up 7% versus the prior year.\nOperating margin rate of 12.71% of sales levered 54 basis points, driven by both higher gross margin and SG&A leverage. The adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% below the prior year rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.8 billion, up $3.1 billion from the same quarter last year largely driven by product inflation and higher freight costs with units roughly flat to prior year.\nThis morning, we are increasing our full year 2022 financial outlook based on stronger-than-expected flow-through year-to-date. Please note that our outlook for operating margin, diluted EPS and return on invested capital are all adjusted to exclude asset impairment and expected transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business.\nWe now expect 2022 sales of approximately $97 billion to $98 billion, representing comparable sales of flat to a decline of 1% as compared to prior year. Please note that at the midpoint of the range, this implies that fourth quarter comparable sales will be slightly positive. This reflects our expectations of continued strong Pro performance and steady DIY trends.\nAs a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. As you look ahead to the fourth quarter, keep in mind that we are cycling over the second round of lumber inflation in 2021, which benefited product margins. We also expect continued shrink pressure next quarter.\nGiven our disciplined focus on expense management, we now expect adjusted operating margin of approximately 13% for the full year. And we are raising our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year from $13.10 to $13.60 to our updated range of $13.65 to $13.80. This reflects better-than-expected SG&A leverage as well as higher-than-planned share repurchase activity. We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year.\nAdditionally, given our larger-than-expected $4.75 billion notes offering in Q3, we expect to accelerate share repurchase activity that we had originally planned for 2023 into this year. We now expect $13 billion in share repurchases in 2022. And finally, we are raising our outlook of adjusted return on invested capital to above 37% for the year.\nNow turning to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy. In Q3, the company generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 20.5 million shares for $4 billion. We also paid $666 million in dividends at $1.05 per share. Capital expenditures totaled $403 million in the quarter as we continue to focus on high-return projects that support our growth objectives.\nWe ended the quarter at 2.5x adjusted debt to EBITDA and we are well on track to reach our target leverage of 2.75x in 2023 while also maintaining our BBB+ rating. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 27.6% inclusive of a 590 basis point impact related to the asset impairment recorded in the third quarter.\nIn closing, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver shareholder value through our leading capital allocation strategy while investing in our associates and our business to drive long-term sustainable growth. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.",

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of IR, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin R. Ellison\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 0.3%, while U.S. comps increased 0.2%. For the quarter, Pro sales remained strong. In fact, this is the ninth consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth. As a reminder, at Lowe's, 75% of our sales are driven by the DIY customer while 25% of our sales is from the Pro. And while underlying home improvement trends remain strong, our DIY sales were lower than expected in the second quarter and the first half of the year.\nAs I mentioned on our previous call, the timing of spring disproportionately impacts DIY sales as many seasonal categories like lawn and garden are heavily concentrated in DIY. In addition to spring arriving late, it also ended early, quickly moving from a cold winter to a hot summer in some regions. This showed in the planting season and pressured lawn and garden sales.\nAlso, while we plan for a modest sector pullback this year as we lap outsized DIY consumer demand, we now believe that certain categories like patio and grills are disproportionately impacted by the unprecedented demand from 2020 and 2021. This unprecedented demand was likely fueled by the combination of 3 rounds of government stimulus, an increase in consumer savings rate and a temporary shift away from spending on services towards spending on goods, including home improvement products. These factors drove more discretionary purchases over the past 2 years than it was possible to precisely measure at the time.\nAnd some of you have asked whether we're seeing consumers trade down in their purchase activity. At this point, we are not seeing indications of material trade down. If anything, we're seeing the opposite with continued strong demand for our new and innovative products at higher price points. Bill will provide more context on our customer spending trends later in the call.\nTo summarize, our DIY trends, despite slower sales in select discretionary categories like patios and grills, the DIY customer remains resilient, which reflects continued strong home improvement demand trends.\nNow turning to Pro. We continue to outperform the market, delivering growth of 13% and 37% on a 2-year basis. We're particularly pleased with the momentum we're seeing with our Pro loyalty program, MVP's Pro Rewards, which is designed to make every Pro feel like an MVP regardless of the size of their business. Because time is money for Pros, one of the most valuable ways that we can serve them is by saving them time with enhanced fulfillment. Therefore, we are actively piloting convenient fulfillment options, including a new Pro fulfillment center in Charlotte, and gig network solutions that offer same-day delivery for both Pro and DIY. Joe will provide a further update on our strategic initiatives to improve Pro penetration later on the call.\nOn Lowes.com, sales grew 7% this quarter, representing a sales penetration of nearly 10%. We're continuing to invest in omnichannel capabilities because we believe there is still tremendous runway for further growth ahead. In Canada, Q2 performance lagged the U.S. And as a reminder, because our Canadian business is more heavily weighted towards lumber, it disproportionately benefited from record high lumber prices last year.\nLet me now discuss our operating performance for the second quarter. I'm particularly pleased with the operating discipline that we've developed across our business, which is demonstrated by our ability to improve operating margin once again despite lower sales. During the quarter, operating margin expanded 12 basis points, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.67, which is an increase of nearly 10% versus last year. The progress also reflects our team's disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity initiatives or PPI. Not only did PPI support our first half operating margin improvement, it will also help to drive operating leverage for the balance of the year and for the next several years. Joe will discuss the success of our PPI initiatives in more detail later in the call.\nNow I'd like to address some concerns that I've heard from our shareholders about the home improvement market. I want to begin by clarifying that the market dynamics that pressure the home builder are not necessarily the same market dynamics that pressure the home improvement retailer. At Lowe's, the 3 highest correlating factors of home improvement demand are home price appreciation, the age of the housing stock and disposable personal income. While housing turnover is important, it does not index at the same rate as home price appreciation, housing age and disposable personal income.\nAnd while we acknowledge that housing turnover has slowed, home prices and home equity remains at record highs, which gives customers confidence that they will get a return on the investment that they make in their homes. And also importantly, those homes keep getting older. More than half of the homes in the U.S. are over 40 years old and millions more built at the peak of the housing boom in the early 2000s are now starting to turn 20 years old, which is a key inflection point for big-ticket repairs.\nIn terms of disposable personal income, household wealth is still at an all-time high. Consumer savings are roughly $2.6 trillion higher than they were pre-pandemic. And 75% of that excess savings is concentrated in middle- and high-income households who are more likely to be homeowners, which highlights another key benefit of our industry, our core customer is the homeowner.\nIn addition to having significantly more disposable income, most homeowners are benefiting from lower fixed mortgage rates. And as low housing supply and high interest rates make moving less desirable, homeowners are motivated to invest in their current homes to fit their needs. This is one of the key reasons that home improvement can win in markets when housing turnover is strong and when it slows as we saw in the mid-1990s when home improvement spend grew despite rising interest rates and a slowdown in housing turnover.\nNow shifting to trends in Pro. We continuously survey our Pros and their confidence in their job prospects is the highest it's been in years. The Pro is busier than ever, and the strength of the Pro backlog speaks to the significant pent-up demand for their services. In short, we are fortunate to operate in this retail sector and despite the macro uncertainty and unprecedented seasonal demand in the past 2 years, our long-term outlook for the home improvement industry and the Pro customer remains positive.\nAs I close, I would like to personally thank our associates for their hard work and dedication. In recognition of some of the cost pressures they are facing due to high inflation, we are providing an incremental $55 million in bonuses to our hourly frontline associates this quarter. These associates have the most important jobs in our company, and we deeply appreciate everything they do to serve our customers to deliver a best-in-class experience.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam P. Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, U.S. comparable sales were up 0.2%. I'd like to walk you through the trends that we are seeing in the business, beginning with our DIY results. As Marvin mentioned, we had a short spring moving directly from winter to summer in many areas of the country, impacting demand for outdoor garden products like fertilizer, chemicals and live nursery. After 2 years of outsized growth in home-related sales, we plan for sales to slow in certain categories this year. And our disciplined planning process enabled us to mitigate many of the inventory pressures you're seeing across the retail industry.\nBut certain categories were still down more than expected, like patio furniture and outdoor grills, which is consistent with trends across the broader market. But even within patio, our newly designed Origin 21 items sold out first in most stores, like our exclusive Brennfield egg chair that retailed at $628.\nAnother interesting trend from the quarter is the ongoing demand for innovation, reflecting underlying consumer strength. Rather than seeing trade down, in many cases, we are seeing customers trade up, spending more to purchase the latest technology like battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands. In fact, one of our top-performing products this quarter was an EGO 56-volt self-propelled mower that retailed for over $700. This unit dramatically outperformed our sales forecast despite being one of the most expensive battery mowers in our assortment, proven what we have said before that value doesn't have to be low priced.\nIn Refrigeration, we continue to see consumers trade up to higher-priced products in brands like KitchenAid, Samsung and LG, with features and benefits that serve a busy family's lifestyle. And while client sales were below our expectations, we continue to take incremental share and lead the market as the #1 appliance retailer in the U.S. We also continue to source new products that make projects easier for our DIY savvy customers, like our expanded STAINMASTER lineup, including laminate flooring, sheet vinyl and tile, which are getting overwhelmingly positive customer feedback due to how easy they are to install and keep clean. Or how about our new build-in Batten product, a Lowe's exclusive? This new pre-sized and miter molding makes it easy and cost-effective for the do-it-yourself or to do highly intricate designs like wanes coating.\nAnd for the Pro, it saves them time on these jobs as well. Customers can transform a wall in a day for less than $300. And across the store and within each of our merchandising categories, we offer value at all price points and feature leading products from our all-star brands like Trex, Owens Corning, John Deere, EGO, Honda, KitchenAid, Samsung, LG, Kohler, Moen, Whirlpool, Husqvarna and Aaron's.\nShifting gears now to our Pro customer, we delivered broad-based and strong results with positive comps across rough plumbing, building materials, paint, electrical, millwork and hardware. We are pleased with the traction that we are making with this important customer and we continue to optimize our Pro assortments to ensure we offer the products Pros need from the brands that they know and trust.\nThis quarter, we launched Eden Creek, a liquid additive that improves the quality, durability and sustainability of concrete projects. We also launched the new stack lithium battery technology in our line of FLEX cordless power tools, making Lowe's now the only destination to have this new battery technology available in both FLEX and DEWALT, which brings more power in a smaller package.\nAnd in millwork, we also were the first to market with our own reliable stock exterior black trim vinyl window, an increasingly popular trend to give homes a more premium look, with some Pros even buying pallets of these products before they even hit our shelves. We also added JELD-WEN prefinished interior doors, which come pre-painted from the factory, saving Pros the time and expense required to paint the door. These additions have further strengthened our portfolio of trusted programs like Bosch, Crescent, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\nIn our lumber business, comps declined modestly as we cycled over record high prices in the previous year. However, unit volumes were up significantly year-over-year, which reflects the strong underlying project demand.\nTurning now to Lowes.com, sales grew 7%, building on top of the tremendous growth we have seen over the past few years. We continue to invest in the online user experience by expanding and enhancing our assortments, building out and improving our visualizer and configurator tools, and enhancing the delivery experience to make it easier for our customers to track their orders.\nAs I close, I'd like to thank my entire merchandising team, along with our finance, inventory and supply chain teams for their disciplined inventory management and planning process in a complex retail environment. And lastly, I'd also like to thank our vendor partners for their continued partnership and hard work to ensure our customers have the products they need for every home improvement project they tackle.\nThank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Michael McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.\nLet me begin by expressing my appreciation for our associates. They delivered strong customer service and profitability this quarter due to their commitment to our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. Over the first half of the year, we have made meaningful strides. I'd like to spend some time now discussing what we are focused on for the remainder of 2022, including how we continue to simplify our store processes.\nEarlier this year, we launched what we call Project Simple in our stores, one of our many PPI initiatives with a focus on further reducing daily duplicative tasks that distract from customer service and drive needless expense. In fact, as we continue rolling out Project Simple, we expect that it will eliminate over 80 nonproductive hours per store per week in the second half.\nIn February, I discussed the launch of our game-changing, new store inventory management system, or SIMS. While we are just 6 months into the implementation, we are already seeing strong results. With the improved inventory visibility, we are reducing nonproductive hours the associates spend searching for product while also improving the customer shopping experience, in-store and online.\nAnd in the second half, we will leverage SIMS for an exciting new feature, prescriptive pack down. This new process will provide specific downstocking instructions to our associates based on sell-through rates. So they know whether the product needs to go directly on to the shelf or the end cap bypassing the top stock altogether. This drives a more efficient, proactive replenishment and inventory planning process.\nAs these examples illustrate, PPI is not a static set of initiatives that will expire at a predetermined date. PPI's perpetual process of ongoing initiatives that will continue to deliver productivity, not only in the second half, but for many quarters to come.\nNow shifting our focus to the Pro. We continue to deliver incredible results with Pro comps of over 13% in the quarter. In fact, this is the ninth quarter in a row that we have driven double-digit Pro comps. Even in a quarter that is traditionally our most DIY-heavy, we saw Pro penetration of over 23% in the U.S., an increase of over 500 basis points from 2019.\nAnd we are further enhancing our Pro offering with our new MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program. This Pro loyalty program launched in the first quarter, and it continues to outperform our expectations.\nIn July, we launched MVP's Bonus Points in conjunction with our first-ever Lowe's MVP bonus days event with a focus on the products that Pros use every day. Pros earn extra bonus points on our leading brands such as DEWALT, Valspar, FLEX, Metabo, A.O. Smith and Frigidaire. Our Pros can redeem their points for other products or gift cards in the MVP Pro Reward Center. It is their choice, and we made it easy for all Pros to benefit.\nAs our MVP's Pro Rewards program continues to mature in the second half, we are excited to present our Pros with compelling offers that will be tailored just for them.\nBefore I close, let me discuss the investments that we are making in our most important asset, our associates, as we strive to become the employer of choice in retail. We recently announced expanded scheduling options for our full-time associates. Most full-time associates can now request a fixed 4-day work week, fixed days off or even choose their preferred shift providing them with predictability on their terms. This is a significant improvement in our associates' quality of life, and it is another way that we are differentiating ourselves from other retailers.\nAs Marvin mentioned, to help our frontline hourly associates during this period of high inflation, we are awarding an incremental bonus of $55 million. Also for a designated time frame, we are providing our associates with an additional 10% discount on everyday household and cleaning items. Associates can now purchase these products at a 20% discount, which we hope will ease the burden of inflation impacting many of these items. We will continue to look for meaningful ways to improve our associates work-life balance, while providing them with the tools to build a career at Lowe's. I would like to thank our associates once again for their commitment to Lowe's and to our customers.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q2 results. We delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.67, an increase of 9.9% compared to prior year as we drove productivity in a dynamic operating environment. Q2 sales were $27.5 billion, with comparable sales down 0.3%. Comparable average ticket increased 6.1% as higher Pro sales and product inflation drove higher average ticket. This was offset by comp transactions declining 6.4% as we cycle over 2 years of outsized growth in DIY sales.\nComp transactions improved over 650 basis points sequentially from Q1. U.S. comp sales were up 0.2% in the quarter. Our sales were impacted by the shortened spring season, lower demand in certain DIY discretionary categories and lower-than-expected lumber prices. This was partially offset by a 13% increase in Pro customer sales. On Lowes.com, sales increased 7% in the quarter.\nOur U.S. monthly comps were down 1.5% in May, up 0.9% in June and up 1.1% in July. Gross margin was 33.24% of sales in the second quarter, down 54 basis points from last year. This is consistent with the expectations that we discussed in May. As expected, product margin rate was down 35 basis points versus the prior year.\nLumber prices declined significantly from late April through mid-June. As we sold through our higher-cost inventory layers, product margin rate was pressured. Higher transportation costs, both import and domestic as well as the expansion of our supply chain network, also drove 35 basis points of pressure. Additionally, we experienced 10 basis points of shrink pressure largely due to live goods damaged by unseasonable weather.\nThese impacts were partly offset by 30 basis points related to more favorable product mix. Despite the product cost pressures in the quarter, gross margin for the first half was up slightly compared to the first half of 2021. This reflected our ability to effectively navigate a volatile lumber market over the first half of the year as well as product cost inflation. I'm very pleased with the strong cross-functional collaboration from the teams as well as our diligent planning efforts.\nSG&A of 16.22% levered 80 basis points relative to Q2 2021. We drove substantial productivity across the enterprise in the quarter against slightly lower sales. Operating profit was $4.2 billion, up slightly versus the prior year. Operating margin rate of 15.39% of sales levered 12 basis points as SG&A leverage was partly offset by lower gross margin rate. The effective tax rate was 24.5%, in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.3 billion, up $2 billion or 11.6% from Q2 last year driven by product cost inflation of 15%, while units were down low single digits.\nThis morning, we are affirming our full year 2022 financial outlook. We now expect that our 2022 sales will be near the bottom of our range of approximately $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales towards the bottom end of the range of down 1% to up 1% for the year. This reflects our first half results and our second half expectations of continued Pro momentum and improving DIY sales trends. We continue to expect Pro to outperform DIY for the remainder of the year.\nAs a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate to be up slightly as compared to the prior year.\nGiven our better-than-expected flow-through in the first half, we now expect operating margin to be at the top end of our range of 12.8% to 13% for the full year. Our ability to lever gross margin and SG&A despite lower-than-expected sales reflects the company's focus, hard work and effective investments over the last several years. Taking all of this into consideration, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be at the top end of the range of $13.10 to $13.60.\nAt Lowe's, we remain committed to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy. For 2022, we continue to expect approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures and $12 billion in share repurchases. Finally, we are affirming our outlook of return on invested capital above 36% for the year.\nTurning to our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy. In Q2, the company generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.5 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 21.6 million shares for $4 billion. We also paid $524 million in dividends at $0.80 per share and we announced a 31% increase to $1.05 per share in support of our 35% target dividend payout ratio.\nCapital expenditures totaled $344 million in the quarter as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to make progress towards our target of 2.75x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, ending the quarter at 2.23x, and we remain committed to maintaining our BBB+ rating. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 34.5% in the quarter, up 548 basis points versus last year.\nAs I look ahead, I'm highly confident that we are making the right investments in our people and capabilities to support our business and drive meaningful long-term shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for questions.",

And welcome to Lowe's Companies' First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kate.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of IR, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website.\nDuring this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.\nAdditionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\nBefore we turn to our first quarter results, I would like to announce that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Conference in-person on Wednesday, December 7, from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time in New York City. For those of you who are unable to attend in-person, the event will also be live-streamed on video. At this event, our executive leadership team will provide updates on the key growth initiatives in our Total Home strategy and our long-term financial targets.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\n\nMarvin R. Ellison\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the first quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 4% with the U.S. comps down 3.8%. Excluding our seasonal category, sales were in line with our expectations for the first quarter.\nLooking at sales goals on a 2-year basis, total company comps and U.S. comps were up approximately 20%. In Pro, we delivered growth of 20% and 64% on a 2-year basis. We also saw solid DIY demand for core nonseasonal home improvement projects. However, we experienced a delayed spring selling season due to prolonged unfavorable weather that impacted spring-related categories.\nIn fact, to put this into historical context, the past April was the coldest in over 20 years and one of the wettest in recent memory. But now spring has finally arrived, and we are seeing the anticipated improvement in our seasonal sales in the month of May.\nI would like to provide some perspective on the impact that a very delayed spring has on our do-it-yourself or DIY sales. As a reminder, roughly 75% of our sales are to the DIY consumer in many seasonal categories like live goods, outdoor power equipment, grills and patio furniture are more heavily concentrated in DIY. And while spring was delayed across all geographies, the season came particularly late in the north, where sales were down double digits in many of our northern markets. And at the same time, sales in our Florida, Charlotte, Nashville, Houston, Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond regions were ahead of our sales expectations, even though spring weather was unfavorable in those regions as well. Simply stated, the further north you look, the larger the negative impact to our seasonal categories.\nAlthough the late spring postponed our DIY sales, our Pro customers continue to shop to fuel their strong business demand. And our recent Pro surveys indicate that the majority of our Pro customers continue to report strength in their business and a full slate of projects for the year. At Lowe's, we see spring as a first half event. And as I mentioned, we are encouraged by the improved sales trends we're seeing in the month of May. We're also ready to capitalize on the increased demand with our enhanced assortment, strong inventory position, improved supply chain capabilities and seasonal staffing in place to serve our customers. Later in the call, Bill will discuss our plans to win spring again this year, while Joe will discuss how we are serving our customers during this busy season.\nImportantly, our Total Home strategy has given us the agility and flexibility to deliver operating margin improvement even when sales decline. During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 65 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $3.51, which is an increase of over 9% versus last year. These results reflect great operational discipline in addition to excellent execution in a number of key initiatives, including our enhanced labor management tools, our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, and our improved pricing capabilities.\nOur Total Home strategy also enabled us to win with both the Pro and DIY customer in Q1 as we elevate our product assortment and provide our customers with the products and brands that they need across all of their home improvement projects.\nLet me now discuss the progress that we're making with our Pro customer. As I mentioned, we delivered Pro growth of 20% in the quarter on top of 36% comps last year. The progress with this very important customer is reflected in the nearly 600-basis-point increase in Pro sales penetration in the U.S. from approximately 19% in Q1 of 2019 to approximately 25% in 2022. Later in the call, Joe will discuss how we continue to drive growth in Pro with the early success of our Lowe's MVP's Pro Rewards and Partnership Program that was launched in the first quarter.\nOn Lowes.com, sales grew 2% on top of over 36% growth in the first quarter of 2021, which represents a 2-year comp of over 39% and nearly 10% sales penetration. As we enhance our omnichannel offering, we are gaining traction with consumers who increasingly expect a fully integrated shopping experience. We're also expanding our market delivery strategy by adding other big and bulky products in Florida including patio, grills and riding lawn mowers to the appliances that we already deliver from our cross-dock terminals. By adding these incremental products, we're better leveraging our fixed costs while enhancing customer service at the same time. We've also converted our fourth geographic area, the Tennessee, Kentucky region to this new delivery model. And we're on track to convert our full portfolio of stores to market delivery by the end of 2023.\nTurning to our results in Canada where our performance lagged the U.S. in Q1. Last year, Canada's results benefited from record high lumber prices due to the higher lumber mix in our Canadian business.\nIn closing, despite some increased uncertainty in the macro environment, our long-term outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Homeowner balance sheets are very strong, and their confidence to purchase big-ticket items is supported by continuing home price appreciation. Other factors like the extension of remote work, the age of the housing stock, millennial household formation and baby boomers preference to age in place, all are long-term tailwinds for home improvement.\nAnd over the past few years, we have greatly improved our operating capabilities so that we now have the agility needed to respond in this dynamic macro environment. These enhanced capabilities will allow us to continue to take market share while expanding our operating margin.\nAnd as a reflection of Lowe's' commitment to the community, at the beginning of the year, we announced a new community impact program called Lowe's Hometowns. This is a 5-year $100 million investment to improve the communities in which we live and work and to ensure we remain committed to giving back to our customers.\nAnd before I close, I would like to welcome Brandon Sink to his new role as EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Brandon brings tenure, home improvement expertise and strong financial and operational acumen to this role, and we're excited to have him on the executive leadership team. I would also like to take a moment to thank Dave Denton for the contribution he made as CFO in the past 3 years.\nAnd at Lowe's, we believe that our store associates are a competitive advantage, and I would like to close by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work and dedication.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam P. Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the first quarter, U.S. comparable sales declined 3.8%, but were up 19.7% on a 2-year basis. This quarter, we delivered a strong positive comp in building products, driven by our momentum with the Pro, while sales in home decor came in above our expectations driven by solid DIY demand. However, comps and hardlines were down compared to prior year as a delayed spring season impacted seasonal categories.\nWe are particularly pleased to see improved demand in seasonal categories over the past few weeks as the spring weather has finally arrived. In the quarter, 10 of 15 categories were above company average while 8 categories were up over 20% on a 2-year basis. Within our home decor division, paint and flooring delivered the strongest comps this quarter. Inside our paint category, the biggest growth drivers were in interior and exterior paint and primers as our in-stocks continue to improve throughout the quarter.\nAlso, our investments in our Pro Paint offering continue to pay off as we've enhanced our Pro service model, expanded associate training and have built out our job site delivery capabilities. We are building on this momentum with the recent launch of our new, incremental paint reward program for our MVPs Pro customers, in addition to the other meaningful rewards they have already received.\nWithin flooring, luxury vinyl was once again the top contributor as our consumers continue to prefer the low maintenance and stylish solutions that this product category has to offer. We also refreshed our STAINMASTER carpet lineup, continuing to reflect current styles and consumer preferences. And in late March, we launched our first extension of the STAINMASTER brand in tile. And right behind tile, we are launching new laminate and luxury vinyl products in STAINMASTER as well. We're excited to have the STAINMASTER brand within our portfolio and to extend its high-performance characteristics and stain-resistant warranty to these new product categories. With this new brand lineup, we are offering innovative and functional products for the home, all with a great value for our customers.\nNow turning to building products. We continue to see broad-based strength across key Pro categories, including electrical, building materials, rough plumbing, millwork and lumber, driven by strong Pro demand and competitive in-stock positions. Building on last year's strong performance, we delivered a positive 38% 2-year comp in building products, which continues to reflect the persistent underlying strength in consumer demand for larger core home improvement projects and, to a lesser extent, commodity inflation.\nOver the past several years, we have been focused on expanding our brand and product offerings to meet the needs of our Pro customers. In this quarter, we are excited about the introduction of Owens Corning new fiberglass rebar known as Pink bar. This Pro family product is stronger than traditional steel rebar and 7x lighter which makes it both easier for the Pro to work with and less costly to ship.\nWe are also excited to announce the national expansion of the APOC roof coating brand, which is a leading manufacturer in roofing and an important strategic partner to Lowe's. These new products and brands are strong additions to our outstanding Pro brand portfolio, which already includes other powerful brands like Bosch, Crescent, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\nNow looking at our performance in hardlines. As I mentioned earlier, our seasonal categories were impacted by delayed spring. As the weather has finally broken over the past few weeks, we have now seen higher demand across the seasonal categories. And it's important to remember that spring is always a first half event. And while this year's spring season has started slow, the teams are focused on delivering a successful spring again this year.\nFrom the convenience and quality of the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands with their zero-emission rechargeable equipment to our other leading brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN, we offer the products that our customers need to have the best-looking yard in the neighborhood. We are also continuing to expand our private brand lineup with new products in Origin 21, our new modern brand as well as our popular allen + roth brand, which is tailored to the more traditional taste.\nSpringFest, which is our new approach to spring, is a multiweek event, and we leveraged several strategic promotions for popular spring items like mulch, soils and hanging baskets to deliver great value for our customers. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the late surge in spring demand, and I look forward to updating on this first half event on our second quarter call.\nNow looking at Lowes.com. As Marvin mentioned, we saw a positive 2% sales growth in the quarter and over 39% positive growth on a 2-year basis. We continue to enhance the user experience on Lowes.com and our omnichannel capabilities, which is critical for consumers who increasingly expect flexibility and seamlessness in their shopping experience. Our new paint and countertop visualizers are driving better conversion rates and we also enabled our customers the ability to order bagged goods online for in-store pickup ahead of the spring season.\nAnd as Marvin mentioned, our enhanced supply chain capabilities, including our expanded coastal holding facility network are now in place to enable us to flow product quickly to where it's needed as weather breaks across the country. And we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate cost increases within our supply chain.\nBefore I close, I'd like to once again thank our vendor partners and our merchants for their hard work and dedication. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Michael McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their continued commitment to serving our customers, especially in this busy spring season. We are laser-focused on delivering a consistent and high-quality customer experience. At the same time, we have labor aligned to demand patterns so that we effectively managed our payroll this quarter even in a lower sales environment. The investments that we've made over the past several years and our enhanced labor management tools are clearly paying dividends as we flex labor across stores and departments so effectively that we continue to achieve strong customer satisfaction scores.\nAlso, the technology enhancements that we've made over the past several years enable our associates to spend 60% of their time serving customers and only 40% on manual tasking activities. As a reminder, as recently as 2018, 60% of all associated time was allocated on tasks that did not support the customer. We flipped this ratio by enabling more and more capabilities on our associates handheld mobile devices, which eliminated many time-consuming tasks. This is in addition to new technology that has enhanced our point-of-sale checkout, modernized project management, improved inventory visibility and digitized in-store pricing for appliances and lumber. This improved associate productivity has not only driven profitability, but it has also enhanced our customer service.\nAnd we continue to unlock further productivity through our Perpetual Productivity Improvement or PPI initiatives. As a reminder, our PPI initiatives are not onetime efforts but rather a series of initiatives that are scaling across our stores over time, all of which contribute to operational efficiency as well as a culture of continuous improvement. As Marvin mentioned earlier, the success of our PPI initiatives contributed to our strong operating margin performance in Q1.\nNow I would like to take a few minutes to discuss our strong Pro results in the first quarter when we launched our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, which is centered around creating a business partnership with our Pro. We are really pleased to see the better-than-expected adoption rates for the new program and we expect to build on this momentum with the Pros as we launch enhanced features to the loyalty program in the coming months.\nThrough this program, we are also gaining valuable insight about our Pro customers that will enable us to better anticipate and meet their project needs through our Pro CRM platform and allow us to continue to expand our share of wallet with these valuable customers. And we're expanding our Pro fulfillment capabilities with our new Pro fulfillment center in Charlotte, where we are stocking the top SKUs that Pros consistently need in job lot quantities. As we pilot this new approach to Pro fulfillment, we are building on our existing job site delivery capabilities handled through our stores and Lowe's Pro supply branches today. Although we are pleased with our 600 basis points of growth in Pro penetration over the past 3 years, improving our fulfillment capabilities will allow us to accelerate this growth and continue to gain market share.\nIn addition to the success of our new Pro initiatives, I am pleased with our strides to become the employer of choice in retail. As a company, we are committed to investing in continuous learning and development throughout our associates careers through Lowe's University as well as a new debt-free education program that we just announced. Through this initiative, more than 300,000 associates are eligible to participate in over 50 academic programs free of charge. These programs are designed to help associates excel in their jobs today and built toward their future careers within Lowe's, including pathways into supply chain, logistics, data analytics, cybersecurity, technology and more.\nFinally, I'm pleased to report that we are in a better position from a hiring and staffing standpoint than we were at this time last year. We accelerated our associate hiring process through new technology that dramatically reduce the time it takes process applications. These new tools ensure that we capture the best candidates in the pipeline and helped us staff up quickly for spring. Looking forward, we are making the right investments to continue to drive productivity while also enhancing our customer service, and we are well positioned to serve our customers to meet the surge in demand for spring products.\nAs I close, I would like to once again thank our store associates for their relentless focus on serving customers and driving productivities in our stores.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Sink\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe. I'd like to begin by saying what an honor it is to serve as Lowe's CFO. Over the past several years, we've made tremendous progress transforming Lowe's into a leading omnichannel retailer with a world-class finance organization. I'm extremely excited to be joining the executive leadership team in my new capacity as we continue our momentum.\nNow turning to Q1 results. We delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.51, an increase of 9% compared to prior year driven by improved gross margin rate and disciplined expense management against lower sales. As expected, we lapped our most difficult sales comparison of the year, given the approximately 300-basis-point benefit from government stimulus last year.\nQ1 sales were $23.7 billion with a comparable sales decrease of 4%. Comparable average ticket grew 9.1%, driven by higher Pro sales, increased levels of product inflation and 150 basis points of commodity inflation. This was offset by comp transaction count declining 13.1% due to a later start to spring as well as the impact of cycling over government stimulus and storm recovery in the prior year. Keep in mind that comp transactions increased 11.8% last year, which results in a 2-year comp transaction count decrease of 2.9%.\nU.S. comp sales were down 3.8% in the quarter and up 19.7% on a 2-year basis. Our Pro sales outpaced DIY with 20% sales growth in the quarter as we continue to build on our momentum with the Pro driven by our elevated product and service offering. And while demand for core DIY categories remain strong, lower sales in seasonal categories pressured sales by approximately $350 million in the quarter or approximately 150 basis points. On Lowes.com, sales increased 2% in the quarter and over 39% on a 2-year basis.\nOur U.S. monthly comps were up 8.5% in February, down 7.8% in March and down 6.9% in April. In March, we cycled over the third round of government stimulus and the storm recovery sales in Texas while April sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather. Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2020 to 2022, February sales increased 34.5%, March increased 25.3% and April increased 6%.\nGross margin was 34.03% of sales in the first quarter, up 74 basis points from last year. Product margin rate improved 50 basis points as we leveraged our disciplined pricing and product cost management strategies to effectively manage product cost inflation and lumber price volatility. Also, higher credit revenue drove 25 basis points of benefit to gross margin this quarter, while a favorable product mix drove 20 basis points of benefit. These benefits were partly offset by 10 basis points of pressure from live goods damaged by unseasonably cold weather as well as 10 basis points of planned pressure from increased distribution costs.\nSG&A of 18.19% levered 21 basis points compared to SG&A in Q1 last year. As Joe mentioned, we drove improved store labor productivity which was offset by lower fixed cost leverage against lower sales and increased wage rate. Operating profit was $3.3 billion, in line with prior year. Operating margin rate of 13.96% of sales levered 67 basis points versus prior year. Our ability to leverage operating margin despite a decline in sales reflects our improved operating capabilities that enable us to rapidly adjust in a dynamic operating environment.\nThe effective tax rate was 23.7%, in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $20.2 billion, up $2.6 billion from Q4 levels in line with seasonal trends. This reflects a $1.9 billion or 10% increase from Q1 2021. Our inventory balance reflects an approximately 13% increase from both product and commodity inflation, while balances were also higher than expected due to a late breaking spring.\nNow turning to our 2022 financial outlook. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations, excluding seasonal categories. However, as Bill mentioned, spring is truly a first half event and the timing is driven by when weather breaks across the country. Over the past 2-plus weeks, we are seeing improved trends in our seasonal categories, which is reinforcing our confidence that we will deliver first half results in line with our full year guide.\nThis morning, we reaffirmed our full year 2022 financial outlook. We continue to expect 2022 sales in a range of $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY for the year. As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate for the full year to be up slightly as compared to prior year. However, as lumber prices declined several weeks earlier than we expected, gross margin pressure will shift into Q2 as we continue to turn through our higher cost inventory layers. As a result, we now expect to see our gross margin for the first half to be up slightly compared with our gross margin in the first half of 2021.\nWe also continue to expect operating margin in the range of 12.8% to 13% for the full year, driven by a slightly higher gross margin rate and continued execution of our PPI initiatives. We are also confirming our outlook for diluted earnings per share in a range of $13.10 to $13.60. In 2022, we still expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion, and we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy with approximately $12 billion in share repurchases this year while also supporting our 35% target dividend payout ratio. Finally, we are affirming our outlook of return on invested capital above 36% for the year.\nNow I'd like to close by reviewing one of our value creation drivers at Lowe's, our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy. In Q1, the company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 19.2 million shares for $4.1 billion, and we paid $537 million in dividends at $0.80 per share. Capital expenditures totaled $343 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the business to drive growth and enhance returns.\nWe ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which includes proceeds from our $5 billion notes offering in March. This larger-than-planned bond issuance enabled us to slightly accelerate our share repurchase plans in the quarter. The balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we continue to make progress towards our target of 2.75x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, ending the quarter at 2.24x. Driven by both strong operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 33.8% in the quarter, up 380 basis points versus last year.\nIn closing, we are confident in our trajectory and excited for the substantial opportunity ahead of us as we continue to grow our market share, expand operating margin and deliver meaningful shareholder value. And with that, we are now ready for questions.",

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nKate Pearlman\n\nVP of IR, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022.

This resulted in comp sales of 34.5% for the total company and up 35.2% for the U.S. on a 2-year basis. These results capped of outstanding financial results for fiscal 2021 with sales of $96.3 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable basis and earnings per share of $12.04, up 36% on an adjusted basis.\nWith these outstanding results, 100% of our stores earned a quarterly Winning Together profit-sharing bonus. This $94 million payout is $24 million above the target payment level. And in recognition for their hard work throughout the pandemic in 2021, we are awarding an incremental discretionary bonus of $265 million to our frontline associates. Altogether, we rewarded our frontline associates with bonuses of over $350 million in the fourth quarter. As Joe will discuss later in the call, financial support of our frontline associates is consistent with our commitment to being an employer of choice in the retail industry.\nOur Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum as we grow our share of wallet with both Pro and DIY as they increasingly rely on Lowe's as a one-stop solution for all their project needs. In looking at our results this quarter, I'm particularly encouraged that our growth was broad-based and balanced across product categories, across both DIY and Pro, both online and in-store.\nIn Pro, we delivered growth of 23% and 54% on a 2-year basis. And we are building on our momentum with the Pro with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program, MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program. We redesigned our loyalty program based on feedback from our Pro customers who expressed a desire for a business partnership rather than a series of stand-alone transactions. Our data shows that Pros who leverage our loyalty and credit offering spend 300% more than Pros not engage in these programs. Our Pro business is off to a strong start this year and we're excited about the national launch of our MVPs Pro loyalty program. I look forward to providing updates on this critical initiative throughout the year.\nNow turning to our DIY customer, where we delivered growth on top of exceptionally strong demand last year. Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we continue to grow our DIY market share by elevating our private brands product assortments in our home decor category.\nOn Lowes.com, sales grew 11.5% on top of 121% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a 2-year comp of 147% and nearly 11% sales penetration. Our intuitive online shopping experience and expanded on-trend assortments are resonating with our customers. And while we're pleased that our online sales have more than doubled over the past 2 years, we still have tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And as part of our efforts to enhance our omnichannel experience, we are expanding our same-day and next-day fulfillment capabilities.\nWith that in mind, we're actively piloting several gig network solutions, including partnering with Instacart in several markets with same-day DIY home delivery. And building on the success we gained in the Florida and Ohio Valley regions with our market delivery strategy, we completed the conversion of our third geographic area, the Carolina region, during the fourth quarter. Although reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes. This replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products.\nAs we continue to expand our market-based delivery model, we're freeing up space in our 10,000 square foot store back rooms, which on average are considerably larger than our competition. And we are testing out different options to drive both greater in-store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both Pro and DIY customers. In a few minutes, Bill will discuss our continued investments in online as we create a best-in-class integrated omnichannel shopping experience.\nDuring the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 115 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $1.78, which is a 34% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year. These results reflect our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI as well as the ongoing benefits of our new pricing strategies. Joe and Dave will discuss these initiatives in further detail later in the call.\nTurning to our results in Canada where performance lagged the U.S. The Canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the U.S.\nFor our close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market as well as our opportunity to continue to win share. Our outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong, supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheet, especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation. Persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment. In fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.\nOther trends remain favorable, including baby boomers' increasing preference to age in place. And with the extension of remote work for some employees, we're expecting a permanent step-up in repair and maintenance cycle. And as a reminder, 50% of the homes in the U.S. are over 40 years old and will continue to require investments for upkeep and approximately 2/3 of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity. Therefore, we're encouraged that the macro environment for home improvement remains very supportive.\nAs we close the year, we continue to give back to the communities where we operate, with total donations of $100 million in 2021 well over our pre-pandemic levels. And we're pleased that our efforts to enhance our brand reputation while supporting our associates and driving long-term value for our shareholders and was recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as they named Lowe's the #1 Most Admired Specialty Retailer for the second year in a row. This is the first time in our history that we received this recognition in back-to-back years.\nIn closing, I'd like to extend my Hartford appreciation to our frontline associates. As I travel the country every week visiting stores, I continue to be struck by their commitment to supporting our communities while providing excellent customer service.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam P. Boltz\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales increased 5.1% and 35.2% on a 2-year basis. We delivered positive comps in all 3 merchandising divisions in the quarter with growth across Pro and DIY customers. Growth was well balanced with 12 of 15 merchandising departments comping positive and was broad-based on a 2-year basis with all 15 departments up more than 18% in that time frame.\nBeginning with our Home Decor merchandising division, flooring and appliances delivered the strongest comps in the quarter. In flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as we continue to see consumer preference shifting towards this affordable and stylish solution. Lowe's already offers a wide selection of vinyl flooring products, including several Pergo WetProtect options. And this year, we look forward to extending our own trusted STAINMASTER brand with its high performance characteristics and lifetime stain-resistant warranty across a full range of flooring products, including laminate, tile and vinyl.\nWithin appliances, sales of ranges, cooktops, along with dishwashers were the strongest in the quarter. As we continue to extend our private brand offering, we recently launched Origin 21 across several product categories in home decor. This is our new modern brand designed for the trend-setting millennial consumer, while our ever popular allen + roth brand is tailored to the more traditional style.\nNow turning to our performance in hardlines. The team delivered an exceptional holiday season. Customers were active early and shopped often in our Trimmin Tree category, which drove excellent sell-through in this holiday category. Seasonal outdoor living and lawn and garden delivered standout performances as customers continue to enhance their outdoor living spaces with new grills, patio heaters, fire pits as well as live goods for the yards and garden. With the home serving as a center for entertainment, our customers are making the most of their homes, inside and out.\nWe continue to build on our #1 position in outdoor power equipment with further share gains in battery outdoor power equipment as we drove over 37% growth in this area for the quarter and over 118% on a 2-year basis. Both DIY and Pro customers enjoy the convenience, reliability and the power of our innovative battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands. In this spring, we are thrilled to expand our exclusive lineup of EGO battery products with their new 52-inch zero-turn riding mower with features that include a fabricated deck and power to up to 4 acres on a single charge. Also new for EGO is the industry's most powerful handheld battery-powered blower with power that will outperform the leading gas blower with 765 cubic feet per minute of blowing capacity. These new products will complement our existing lineup and assortments from powerful brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN.\nThis spring, we will launch our new Origin 21 patio collections as well as our new style selection replacement cushions. These cushions are made with 100% recycled plastic bottles and they are fade-resistant, UV-protected as well as easy to clean.\nNow turning to the building products division. Our comps were very strong driven by broad-based balanced growth across lumber, electrical, rough plumbing, millwork and building materials. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are building with the Pro as we work to expand our brand and product offerings to meet their project needs.\nNew this year will be a full range of CertainTeed roofing, insulation and gypsum products. As a leading manufacturer of building products for both residential and commercial construction, CertainTeed is an important strategic partner that we are proud to add to Lowe's as we continue to enhance our Pro offering in the building materials category.\nWe also continue to build out our Pro power tool program with the introduction of the new DEWALT power stack battery technology, which is the smallest and most energy-densed battery pack on the market. These new products and new brands are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, Lesko, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\nMoving to Lowes.com. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 11.5% in the quarter and 147% on a 2-year basis in the fourth quarter. We are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across 3 key areas: expanding our online assortment, enhancing the user experience and improving fulfillment.\nFirst, we are expanding our Lowes.com assortment to meet our customers' design and lifestyle needs. For example, within Lowe's Livable Home products, we will offer a range of products to help our customers adapt to their changing mobility needs. At the same time, we will continue to enhance the user experience with continued upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools like kitchen visualizer and measure your space.\nFinally, as we continue to improve our fulfillment capabilities, our customers can now track their appliance delivery in real time, and we will soon be leveraging enhanced technology to further streamline the buy online, pick-up in store experience for our customers through an improved store execution process.\nAs we look ahead to spring, we are well positioned to capitalize on what we expect to be another strong spring season. Consistent with our approach over the past year, we have worked hard to land our spring product early. Through an expansion of our network of coastal holding facilities, we are better able to manage the flow of imported product enabling us to quickly flow product where needed as spring arrives across the country.\nAs one of the largest importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate and manage the impact of cost increases across our supply chain.\nBefore I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendors for their hard work and continued support.\nThank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Michael McFarland\n\nEVP of Stores, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for delivering tremendous results in 2021. In recognition of their outstanding efforts, we awarded the discretionary year-end bonus of $6,000 for assistant store managers, $1,000 for department supervisors, $800 from full-time hourly associates and $400 for part-time hourly associates. As Marvin mentioned, the combination of Winning Together and this discretionary year-end bonus will result in a payout of over $350 million for our frontline associates this quarter.\nAs someone who started his career in home improvement as an hourly associate, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition is for our hourly associates. At Lowe's, our people are truly our most valuable asset. When it comes to recruiting and retaining top talent, we strive to be an employer of choice.\nFrom the moment that a candidate applies for a position at Lowe's, we are committed to creating a positive impression. We have invested in leading technology that accelerates the hiring process so that we are processing applications in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks that the manual process required as recently as last year.\nWe also continue to improve our onboarding process so that our new hires can quickly come up to speed, leveraging the technology and product knowledge that is readily available to them on their handheld mobile devices via the Lowe's University application. As I mentioned on our last call, we are also leveraging our new Lowe's University in-store training labs to provide the ongoing training that our associates need to build their skills and confidence so that they can continue to progress in their career.\nOver the last 3 years, we have created valuable career opportunities for our associates with the incremental 10,000 department supervisor roles and 1,600 ASM positions that we have added. Since 2018, we have also invested well over $2 billion in incremental wage and equity programs for our frontline associates to ensure that we continue to offer a strong competitive wage and benefit package to our associates.\nI'm really pleased to report that our investments to position Lowe's as an employer of choice are paying off. Heading into spring, we anticipate being even better positioned than last year from a hiring perspective. And we are also confident that we will continue to drive productivity in our operations through our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives.\nAs a reminder, this is not a single win. It is a series of improvements that are scaling across our stores over time. In fact, we are working on over 20 different PPI initiatives in our store operations this year. To highlight just a few key PPI initiatives, we have just launched a new store inventory management system, or SIMs, across all of our stores. This platform gives store associates real-time visibility to inventory in their store. This includes inventory in the home bay location as well as product in the top stock and cap off-shelf and back stock room. This new system will eliminate the countless nonproductive hours associates have been spending looking for product.\nI'm also excited about our continuing efforts to eliminate the ancient green screen technology with the launch of our simplified user interface to other selling stations throughout the store. First introduced at our front-end registers, we are beginning to implement this new technology across the sales floor. With this new platform, we are accelerating the associate training process and facilitating cross-training in other departments. This new technology will free up our associates to focus on providing excellent customer service while reducing customer wait time.\nWhile these 2 initiatives are just a few of the PPI deliverables planned for this year, we expect that these 2 initiatives alone will drive $100 million in productivity this year. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage technology to reduce manual tasking for our associates while also enabling them to deliver better service to our Pro and DIY customers.\nI would like to close once again by thanking our store associates for their continued hard work and dedication and the great results we achieved together this year. With that, I will turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Denton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the U.S. economy as it relates to the home improvement sector.\nAs Marvin indicated, the consumer backdrop remains favorable as we are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates. Historically, when interest rates have risen against a strong economic backdrop, the home improvement sector has delivered solid growth.\nDuring these periods, housing affordability was supported by growth in jobs and personal income, which offset the impact of higher in borrowing costs. Today, housing affordability remains above the pre-pandemic average. The market is expecting moderately higher interest rates in the coming quarters. But keep in mind, rates are increasing off historic lows.\nHome equity has increased due to rising home prices and consumer savings are about $2.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels, positioning consumers for continued residential investments. Given all these factors, we are expecting another strong year of demand in the home improvement market.\nNow let me turn to capital allocation. We remain committed to be best-in-class when it comes to our ability to create value for our shareholders through our strong capital allocation program. In 2021, we generated $8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $15.1 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. During the fourth quarter, we paid $551 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 16 million shares for $4 billion. This brought the total to $13.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations of $12 billion. This reflected better-than-expected financial performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders.\nCapital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and nearly $1.9 billion for the full year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to both drive growth and enhance returns across the business. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 1.98x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.75x. As I mentioned at our December 15 investor update, we are planning to return to our leverage target over the next 2 years, driven by our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy.\nWith that, I'd like to turn to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.78, an increase of 34% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. This increase reflected better-than-expected sales growth, improved gross margin rate and favorable SG&A leverage, driven by our productivity initiatives.\nIn the quarter, sales were $21.3 billion, reflecting a comparable sales increase of 5%. Comparable average ticket increased 9.4% and with higher ticket sales in appliances, flooring and seasonal and outdoor living and 90 basis points of commodity inflation in both lumber and copper. In the quarter, comp transaction count decreased 4.4%, but on a 2-year basis, comp transactions increased 8.9%. We continue to gain traction with our Total Home strategy as reflected in Pro growth of 23% and positive DIY comps on top of extremely strong DIY growth last year.\nOn Lowes.com, sales increased 11.5% in the quarter. U.S. comp sales increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% on a 2-year basis. We saw acceleration in both our Pro and our DIY comp sales trends from our third quarter performance. By month, our U.S. comparable sales were up 8.1% in November, up 7.4% in December and down 1.3% in January. Recall that we cycled over government stimulus in late December and early January of last year. But looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to 2021, November sales increased 33.8%, December increased 37.4% and January increased 33.9%.\nGross margin was 32.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 115 basis points from last year. Product margin rate increased 65 basis points, driven by our disciplined pricing and cost management strategies. Improvements in both shrink and credit revenue benefited gross margin by 50 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by roughly 30 basis points of pressure related to higher transportation and importation costs as well as the expansion of our supply chain network.\nI'd like to spend just a moment addressing the recent increase in lumber prices. We are confident that we have an effective strategy to carefully manage our inventory and rapidly adjust pricing. Although we are planning for our lumber margins to be compressed when prices decline, we are confident in our outlook for gross margin rate to be up slightly in 2022.\nTurning to SG&A. We levered 15 basis points versus LY, driven by higher sales and our relentless focus on productivity. This quarter, we incurred $50 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to $165 million of COVID-related expenses last year. This reduction in these expenses generated 60 basis points of SG&A leverage.\nAdditionally, we incurred $150 million of expenses related to the U.S. stores reset in the fourth quarter of last year. As we did not incur any material expenses related to this project in '21, this generated approximately 75 basis points of SG&A leverage versus LY. These benefits were pressured by 100 basis points related to the discretionary year-end bonus of $215 million for our store-based frontline associates.\nOperating profit was over $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus LY. Operating margin of 8.7% for the quarter increased 115 basis points over last year, largely driven by higher gross margin rate as well as favorable SG&A leverage. The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter, which is in line with prior year.\nAt year-end, inventory was $17.6 billion, up $920 million from Q3 and in line with seasonal trends and consistent with our effort to land spring products earlier. Driven by both improved operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 35% for the year, up 760 basis points from 2020.\nNow turning to our 2022 financial outlook. We closed out 2021 ahead of the expectations that we presented at our December 15 investor update. Month-to-date, February, U.S. comparable sales trends are in line with our fourth quarter performance on a 2-year basis. And based on the continued momentum that we are seeing in Pro sales as well as higher expectations for commodity inflation, we are raising our sales outlook for 2022 to a range of between $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%.\nNow please keep in mind that our outlook assumes that lumber pricing will return to a more normalized level in the second half of the year. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY in 2022. Keep in mind that we are cycling over an estimated 300 basis points of stimulus in the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales.\nWe now expect gross margin rate in 2022 to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. With higher projected sales, improving gross margin outlook and continued execution of our PPI initiatives, we are raising our outlook for operating margin to a range of 12.8% to 13% from a prior range of 12.5% to 12.8% for the full year. We are also raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to a range of $13.10 to $13.60 from a prior range of $12.25 to $13.\nIn 2022, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $12 billion. Finally, we are raising our outlook for return on invested capital to above 36% from our original outlook of approximately 35%.\nIn closing, we are off to a great start in 2022. We have significant runway ahead of us to both grow our market share, expand operating margins and deliver meaningful long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, we are now ready for questions.",
